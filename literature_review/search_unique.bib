abstract={Abstract The â€œWanlihongâ€ Meretrix meretrix (WLH-M) clam is a new variety of this species that has a red shell and stronger Vibrio tolerance than ordinary M. meretrix (ORI-M). To investigate the molecular mechanisms responsible for the WLH-M strainâ€™s tolerance to Vibrio, we challenged clams with Vibrio parahaemolyticus and then assessed physiological indexes and conducted transcriptome analysis and RNA interference experiments. The mortality, tissue bacterial load, and hemocyte reactive oxygen species level of ORI-M were significantly higher than those of WLH-M, whereas the content and activity of lysozyme were significantly lower. Gene Ontology functional annotation analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis revealed that immune and metabolic pathways were enriched in Vibrio-challenged clams. The expressions of the heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) and serine protease (SP) genes, which are involved in antibacterial immunity, were significantly upregulated in WLH-M but not in ORI-M, while the expression of the kynurenine 3-monooxygenase gene, a proinflammatory factor, was significantly downregulated in WLH-M. RNA interference experiments confirmed that Hsp70 and SP downregulation could result in increased mortality of WLH-M. Therefore, we speculate that Hsp70 and SP may be involved in the antibacterial immunity of WLH-M in vivo. Our data provided a valuable resource for further studies of the antibacterial mechanism of WLH-M and provided a foundation for the breeding of pathogen-resistant strains.},

title={A review of the role of probiotics for the control of viral diseases in aquaculture},
abstract={The advancement of technology, globalization of trade, massive demand, and cost-effective practices has fuelled the fast expansion of the aquaculture industry in recent time. Viral infections, on the contrary, limit aquaculture production, affecting the global economic progression and prosperity. Disease managements accomplished through conventional methods, synthetic chemicals, or antibiotics were found to have detrimental effects on the environment. Again, the incidents of viral infection may become epizootics if fish healthcare professionals may not have an effective hazard management mechanism in place. The chief approach to preventing viral epidemics is to stop the infection from spreading. Under such circumstances, the probiotics appear as the most promising approach to the prevention of viral infections and pathogenicity. Bacterial probiotics like<c2><a0>Pediococcus acidilactici, Pseudomonas<c2><a0>sp., Vibrio<c2><a0>sp.,<c2><a0>Bacillus<c2><a0>sp.,<c2><a0>Aeromonas<c2><a0>sp., Pseudoalteromonas<c2><a0>sp., Alteromonas<c2><a0>sp., Lactobacillus casei, Lactococcus lactis, and Lactobacillus plantarum,<c2><a0>and algal paraprobiotics (ghost probiotic) like Nannochloropsis gaditana<c2><a0>are found to be effective in controlling viral pathogens allied with aquaculture. The study revealed the conventional strategies available in aquaculture against viruses. The study also provides a conception of probiotics, their mode of application, and approaching standpoints related to the remediation of viral diseases in aquaculture.},

title={Habitat complexity in shallow lakes and ponds: importance, threats, and potential for restoration},
abstract={In this review we describe patterns and mechanisms by which habitat complexity is crucial for the functioning of shallow lakes and ponds, and for the abundance and diversity of biological communities in these ecosystems. Habitat complexity is affected by processes acting at different spatial scales, from the landscape to the ecosystem level (i.e., morphometric attributes) that generate different complexities, determining the potential for organisms to succeed and processes to occur, such as energy and nutrient transfer, and<c2><a0>fluxes of greenhouse gases, among others. At the local scale, the three major habitats, pelagic, littoral, and benthic, are characterised by different degrees of structural complexity and a particular set of organisms and processes. Direct and indirect effects of changes in within-lake habitat complexity can either hinder or promote regime shifts in these systems. We also review several anthropogenic pressures (eutrophication, urbanisation, introduction of exotic species, and climate change) that decrease lake resilience through changes in habitat complexity and strategies for habitat complexity restoration. Overall, we emphasize the need to preserve and/or restore habitat complexity as key challenges to account for ecosystem integrity, maintenance of local/regional biodiversity, and for the<c2><a0>provision of crucial ecosystem services (e.g., biodiversity, self-purification, and carbon sequestration).},

title={Can grazing and/or nutrient excretion by the native bivalve <i>Diplodon parallelopipedon</i> (Hyriidae) boost phytoplankton-cyanobacterial development?},
abstract={Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are common in freshwater ecosystems and promote poor water quality. Toxins released by cyanobacteria affect animals and humans. Eutrophication is assumed to be one of the causes for the increase of HABs. Alternatively, bivalves can directly control phytoplankton biomass through filtration and nutrients excretion. However, these interaction remains less known about different bivalve species. Diplodon parallelopipedon (native to South America) is capable of consuming a wide range of particles by filter feeding and release nutrients available for phytoplankton. The aim of this study was to understand the role of the native bivalve D. parallelopipedon in phytoplankton dynamics. First, we compared grazing of 2 different food sources: (i) laboratory culture of Cryptomonas spp. (C) and (ii) wild populations of Microcystis aeruginosa complex (MAC). Both food sources were mixed to create a gradient of relative abundance expressed in % of MAC:C treatments: (1) 100 MAC, (2) 75:25, (3) 50:50, (4) 25:75, and (5) 100 C. Second, we studied nitrogen and phosphorus excretion rates displayed by D. parallelopipedon. Our results supported the hypothesis that D. parallelopipedon might favor the occurrence of MAC blooms by three mechanisms. On one hand, not being able to consume it when it is forming scums. Moreover, D. parallelopipedon actively consumed potential competitors. Finally, Diplodon potentially boosts MAC growth by nutrient releasing.},

title={Effects of relic low-head dams on stream denitrification potential: seasonality and biogeochemical controls},
abstract={The majority of dams in the contiguous United States are small, low-head dams that are no longer operational but can influence the water quality of contemporary stream ecosystems. Potential effects of low-head dams on stream nitrogen removal (denitrification) have been rarely quantified, and yet they can be an important part of the decision-making process of removing low-head dams. Here, we provide novel empirical data on potential denitrification rates and their biogeochemical controls above and below two mid-Atlantic low-head dams over a 2-year period. Our results show that low-head dams did not increase streambed potential denitrification in comparison to dam-free sections in the same rivers. In our study sites, potential denitrification above low-head dams was generally low (15.7<e2><80><89><c2><b1><e2><80><89>3.5<c2><a0><c2><b5>g N [kg sediment]<e2><88><92>1<c2><a0>h<e2><88><92>1) despite recurring events of water hypoxia (<<e2><80><89>50% dissolved oxygen saturation) and high NO3<e2><88><92> and DOC concentrations.

Results from this study suggest limited effects of relic low-head dams on nitrogen removal and transport in stream ecosystems, and can contribute to the decision-making process of removing low-head dams.},

abstract={In the present study, 29 chemicals derived from tire wear were monitored by deploying Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Samplers (POCIS) in four WWTPs and two drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) located in a municipality in southern Ontario, Canada. Target analytes included 1,3-diphenylguanidine (DPG), the oxidation byproduct of N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N<e2><80><b2>-phenyl-1,4-benzenediamine<c2><a0>called 6PPD-quinone, hexamethoxymethylmelamine (HMMM), and 26 of HMMM<e2><80><99>s known transformation products (TPs). This study is the first to monitor all these target compounds in DWTPs, as well as to report data for the presence of 6PPD-quinone in WWTPs. HMMM and selected TPs of this compound were detected in POCIS deployed in the WWTPs and in the DWTPs. The maximum estimated time-weighted average (TWA) concentration of HMMM of 83.2<e2><80><89><c2><b1><e2><80><89>25.2<c2><a0>ng/L was observed in the effluent of one of the WWTPs. The TWA concentrations were not determined for any of the other target analytes, as POCIS sampling rates have not been determined for these chemicals. The total mass of HMMM and its TPs accumulated on POCIS frequently exceeded 4000<c2><a0>ng and the masses were generally lower in WWTP effluents relative to the influents. For other target analytes, the amounts accumulated on POCIS deployed in WWTP effluents frequently exceeded the amounts accumulated on POCIS deployed in the influents. DPG was detected in POCIS deployed in both the WWTPs and the DWTPs,<c2><a0>and 6PPD-quinone was detected in POCIS deployed in both the influent and the effluent of WWTPs. We speculate that these tire wear compounds are entering WWTPs through stormwater overflows into the sewers or from commercial sources (e.g., car washes). This study highlights the need for an assessment of both WWTPs and DWTPs as sinks and sources of these tire wear compounds and the efficacy of treatment processes to remove them from both wastewater and drinking water.},

title={Cold-tolerant traits that favour northwards movement and establishment of Mediterranean and Ponto-Caspian alien aquatic invertebrates},
abstract={Over recent decades, many Mediterranean and Ponto-Caspian aquatic invertebrate species have dispersed northwards and established as non-native species in colder regions. We hypothesized that these species have cold-tolerant traits, which facilitate dispersal into colder climates. Thanks to these traits, Southern European aquatic species are able to cross biogeographic boundaries. We downloaded the list of all alien invertebrate species that were fully aquatic (i.e. lacking terrestrial adults) from the GRIIS database and picked out those Mediterranean and Ponto-Caspian species that have undergone northwards range expansion. We identified traits that may facilitate dispersal to colder climates including the following: small size; capacity for behavioural thermoregulation; feeding habit (omnivorous, filter-feeders, food generalists); quiescence and dormancy (or diapause); freezing avoidance (presence of cryoprotectants); tolerance to low temperatures or eurythermicity; active dispersal; and enhanced reproduction. We statistically tested the null hypotheses that Mediterranean and Ponto-Caspian alien aquatic invertebrate species that dispersed into the north have all of these traits. We used contingency tables populated with raw frequency data with <cf><87>2<e2><80><94>tests and assessed statistical significance at <ce><b1> of 0.05. We identified 95 Mediterranean and Ponto-Caspian alien aquatic invertebrate species that have shown northwards range extension, 10 (10%) of which were of Mediterranean origin and 85 (90%) of Ponto-Caspian origin. We found that this northwards dispersal from Southern Europe is mainly limited to a few following groups of aquatic invertebrates: small crustaceans, molluscs, cnidarians and annelids. Ability to go to diapause, hibernation or resting period, temperature tolerance and small size were the traits most commonly shared by these organisms. We conclude that Mediterranean and Ponto-Caspian aquatic invertebrate species showing northwards range expansion have cold-tolerant strategies. The traits analysed can favour the establishment of the species.},

Acute and chronic toxicity effects of the heptachlor pesticide on tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus): Impact to behavioral patterns and histopathological responses. Journal of Coastal Research, 38(5), 999<e2><80><93>1010. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208.Heptachlor is an organochlorine (cyclodiene) insecticide that enters water bodies and affects aquatic organisms such as fishes and shellfishes. Due to its persistent nature, it spreads from the source of its use and pollutes the area. The toxic effect of heptachlor on histopathological changes in the gill, liver, kidney, and muscles of tilapia Oreochromis mossambicus were studied. The experimental fish were exposed to four concentrations of heptachlor, viz., 0.756, 1.513, 3.025, and 6.050 ppm, for a period of 96 hours during an acute toxicity test. In the current study, the lethal concentration (LC50) value of heptachlor on tilapia at 96 hours was calculated as 4.006 ppm. Fish were subjected to three different concentrations of heptachlor (0.2003, 0.4006, and 0.8012 ppm) based on the LC50 value to study the long-term effect of heptachlor. Histological changes such as lamellar fusion, lamellar cell hyperplasia, degenerated secondary gill lamellae; Bowman's space dilation and renal tubules detachment; hepatic cells death, melanomacrophage formation, and multifocal degeneration of myocytes; and myoepithelium vacuolation were observed in the gill, kidney, liver, and muscles, respectively, during acute and chronic exposure to heptachlor. The toxicity study revealed that the heptachlor pesticide is highly toxic to tilapia even at a minimum concentration of 0.756 ppm. Hence, it is suggested that care must be taken not to allow the entry of pesticides into the habitat of fishes.},

abstract={Successful papillary adhesion is the first essential step for serious ascidian biofouling in marine ecosystems; however, the mechanisms of papillary adhesion have not been fully elucidated. Here, we employed transcriptome sequencing to assess the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between papillae and remaining body in the larvae of the highly fouling invasive model ascidian Ciona robusta. Enrichment results for DEGs showed that papillae were adhesive structures with the combined functions of substrate recognition, environmental perception, and adhesive protein synthesis and secretion. Two candidate ascidian papilla adhesive proteins (APAPs), APAP-1 and APAP-2, were identified, expressed, and purified in vitro. Surface coating tests showed that APAP-1 was a cohesive protein while APAP-2 was an interfacial protein involved in the adhesion between papillae and material surface. Collectively, the obtained DEGs and adhesive proteins provide candidates to deeply understand molecular mechanisms of underwater adhesion and further develop anti-fouling strategies in marine ecosystems.},

abstract={Biological invasions, especially invasive alien aquatic plants, are a major and growing ecological and socioeconomic problem worldwide. Freshwater systems are particularly vulnerable to invasion, where impacts of invasive alien species can damage ecological structure and function. Identifying abiotic and biotic factors that mediate successful invasions is a management priority. Our aim was to determine the environmental correlates of Elodea nuttallii; a globally significant invasive aquatic species.Elodea nuttallii presence/absence (occurrence), extent (patch area) and percentage cover (density) was visually assessed from a boat throughout Lough Erne (approximately 144â€‰km2), County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland during the active summer growth season (Julyâ€“September). In addition, substrate type and zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha occurrence was recorded. Fourteen water chemistry variables were collected monthly from 12 recording stations throughout the lake during the 9â€‰years before the survey to spatially interpolate values and establish temporal trajectories in their change. Shoreline land use was derived from CORINE land cover maps. Environmental associations between E.Â nuttallii, substrate, D.Â polymorpha, water chemistry and land use were assessed.Elodea nuttallii occurrence was positively associated with water conductivity, alkalinity, suspended solids, phosphorus (both total and soluble) and chlorophyllâ€a concentrations, but negatively associated with pH and total oxidised nitrogen. E.Â nuttallii patch extent and proportional cover were positively associated, to varying degrees, with the presence of D.Â polymorpha, biological oxygen demand, water clarity and soft substrate, but negatively associated with urban development and ammonium.Elodea nuttallii displayed high levels of phenotypic plasticity in response to environmental variation, allowing it to adapt to a wide range of conditions and potentially gain competitive advantage over native or other invasive macrophytes.It is evident that multiple abiotic and biotic factors, including facilitation by coâ€occurring invasive dreissenid mussels, interact to influence the distribution and abundance of E.Â nuttallii. Thus, it is necessary to consider a more comprehensive environmental context when planning Elodea management strategies.},

Since 2013, massive mortalities have been recorded in the Canal Imperial de Arag<c3><b3>n (CIA), an anthropogenic habitat where the highest density of P. auricularius had been recorded in Spain. An adequacy habitat index was calculated assigning scores to different environmental variables to select the most suitable river stretches receiving the translocated specimens.

The next year, 95% of these specimens were found alive, suggesting a successful initial establishment. Specimens translocated in 2018 and 2019 showed a survival of c. 69% and 49%, respectively. In contrast, the control group left in CIA in 2017 showed a much lower survival rate of 19.7% after one year, which remained equally low during the next two years. Currently, the conditions in the Ebro River seem to allow a higher survival rate for P. auricularius than those in the CIA; nevertheless, future monitoring should confirm their long-term success.},

abstract={Sulfide formation in anaerobic lake sediments depends on supply rates of organic carbon and sulfate. Improvements to wastewater treatment plant effluent quality (e.g., lower total phosphorus (P)) and sulfur emissions can affect sulfide formation rates, which, in turn, can affect metal chemistry including internal iron loading. To determine if these improvements corresponded with sulfide and iron-related signals in sediments over time, acid-volatile sulfide (AVS) and acid-extractable iron accumulation rates were measured in sediment cores of two lakes with anaerobic hypolimnia, the formerly eutrophic, now mesotrophic central basin of Lake Erie, one of the Laurentian Great Lakes, and a small meso-eutrophic moraine lake in southern Ontario, Lake St. George. AVS accumulation rates declined gradually in both lakes after 1980 by 95% and 57%, respectively. Acid-extractable iron accumulation rate profiles were similar to AVS in both lakes, but acid-extractable iron rates were several orders of magnitude larger than AVS rates, hence most of the iron was not chemically associated with AVS. In contrast to the gradual declines in AVS, total P loading to Lake Erie did not decline much after 1980, total P concentrations in Lake St. George remained relatively constant between 1980 and 2014, and sulfate concentration decreases were too small in both lakes to account for the large AVS declines after 1980. Hence, productivity and sulfur emission signals appear to have been overridden by diagenetic processes, which produced similar profiles. Therefore, AVS and acid-extractable iron do not appear to be useful as paleo-indicators of trophic status and sulfate deposition.},

An insufficient understanding of the species<e2><80><99> habitat use outside of its spawning season hinders the ability of fisheries managers to implement appropriate habitat protection and restoration measures. To enhance our understanding of river redhorse habitat use, we implanted 15 individuals with radio transmitters during the spring spawning run and tracked their locations over the course of a summer. River redhorse movement varied greatly with some individuals remaining within the spawning area throughout the summer and others traveling as far as 50<c2><a0>km down river. Once post-spawn movement ceased, river redhorse established themselves in small home ranges between 0.04 and 0.12 km2. We found no obvious selection for depth, sediment type, macrophyte presence, or water velocity. Instead, river redhorse strongly selected for habitat containing freshwater mollusks, the primary food source for the species. This suggests that they were seeking foraging habitat during this time period. These findings provide insight into river redhorse management, indicating that the recovery of the species may depend on our ability to protect these newly discovered feeding areas. Future river redhorse management efforts should therefore focus on the protection of native mussels and snails and the maintenance of migration routes between spawning and summer habitats.},

title={Pelagic cyanobacterial nitrogen fixation in lakes and ponds of different latitudinal zones},
abstract={Excess nitrogen (N) loading is one of the main factors causing eutrophication. Biological N fixation (BNF), as a main contributor to N loading, plays a critical role in the N cycle. The N2 fixation rate (N2fix) is regulated by many factors and is usually higher under conditions of N deficiency. Most studies have focused on the regulation of factors that influence the N2fix in specific aquatic ecosystems or artificial conditions, while fewer have focused on large scale such as the latitudinal distribution of N2fix. To understand the regulation of the N2fix in latitudinal zones, the key factors, and the underlying mechanism, we compared the N2fix in 27 lakes located in different latitudinal zones and analyzed the main regulators. The results showed that (1) heterocyst density (DHet) and the N2fix were highest in low-temperate lakes and were 2.5<e2><80><93>2.7 and 11.6<e2><80><93>22.1 times greater than in high-temperate lakes and tropical lakes, respectively, in the 99th quantile; (2) DHet increased and then decreased with increasing latitude and radiation, and peaked at 30.28<c2><b0> N and 2300<c2><a0>J/cm/d; (3) DHet was positively correlated with temperature and increased slightly with increasing temperature; (4) N2fix increased and then decreased with increasing latitude, temperature and radiation, and peaked at 38.8<c2><b0> N, 24.21<c2><a0><c2><b0>C and 2120<c2><a0>J/cm/d. The results suggest that BNF could be regulated by larger scale factors, e.g., temperature and radiation in latitudinal scale. Compared with high-temperate lakes and tropical lakes, low-temperate lakes may face more difficulties in controlling eutrophication due to the potentially higher N loading from BNF under similar nutrient and morphometric conditions.},

title={Physiological and morphological assessments suggest opposite structural allocation strategies between closely related invasive clams},
abstract={Respiration is a central physiological function related to the rates of energy acquisition, transformation, and use by organisms, while allometric relationships provide insight into patterns of allocation of that energy. To assess life strategy differences between closely related invasive species, we measured oxygen consumption rates, tissue mass, shell mass, and gill area of Corbicula fluminea and Corbicula largillierti clams. We compared patterns of metabolic scaling between the two species using model II regressions. Although oxygen consumption rates were strongly associated with gill area in both species, C. fluminea had consistently higher metabolic rates, shell thickness, and shell mass, but a lower tissue-to-shell mass ratio, than C. largillierti. These differences were more marked among small individuals. Our results suggest opposite structural allocation strategies between the two species. Corbicula fluminea invests more energy in the development of thicker shells in early life stages, which can be subsidized by higher metabolic rates than C. largillierti. By contrast, C. largillierti allocates more energy to tissue mass production. These differences may play a role in explaining contrasting competitive and colonization abilities and geographical distribution patterns between both species in invaded areas.},

title={Population decline of an endangered unionid, <i>Pronodularia japanensis</i>, in streams is revealed by eDNA and conventional monitoring approaches},
abstract={Environmental DNA (eDNA) is useful to detect the presence of aquatic organisms from water samples, especially for rare and cryptic species. Two freshwater unionid mussels<c2><b8> Pronodularia japanensis and Nodularia douglasiae, have rapidly declined over the last three decades and are now threatened with extinction on the Matsuyama Plain, south-western Japan. We designed a species-specific eDNA marker targeting the COI region of P. japanensis. The distribution of this species in the Kunichi River system on the Matsuyama Plain was investigated using both quantitative PCR with this eDNA marker and conventional surveying. We show that the distribution area of P. japanensis did not change between 2013<e2><80><93>2014 and 2020<e2><80><93>2021, but its density decreased by 99%. eDNA of P. japanensis was detected, with 100% success, from sites where this species was collected by hand. Furthermore, eDNA was detected at nine sites where P. japanensis was not collected but was expected to occur. This study has established a species-specific eDNA marker targeting the COI region of P. japanensis, and this eDNA marker has been validated as effective for surveying the distribution of this species. Using this eDNA marker, extensive investigation of remaining populations and the monitoring of them should improve conservation practices.},

title={Parasites as Biological Indicators: the Impact of Environmental Quality on the Infections of <i>Lamproglena clariae</i> (Crustacea) on <i>Clarias gariepinus</i> Along the Vaal River, South Africa},
abstract={Anthropogenic activities influence the natural equilibrium of freshwater ecosystems resulting in negative ecological impacts. Differences in the infection variables of Lamproglena clariae in relation to variable water quality influenced by metal pollution were studied at six sites along the Vaal River, South Africa (March 2017 and October 2018). From each sampling site, in situ water quality parameters, water and sediment samples, and a minimum of 10 Clarias gariepinus were collected. Lamproglena clariae specimens collected from the gills of C. gariepinus were used to calculate the prevalence, mean intensity, and mean abundance of the parasite. Metal concentrations in water and sediment were analysed with inductively coupled plasma<e2><80><93>optical emission spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma<e2><80><93>mass spectrometry. Parasite intensity correlated negatively with some water quality parameters (conductivity, salinity, pH, total dissolved solids, and dissolved oxygen). Negative correlations were found between L. clariae (intensity and prevalence) and metal concentrations (Cu, Cr, Zn, Cd) in water. Parasite infections were influenced negatively at sites with high metal concentrations recorded in sediment and water and high levels of organic pollution. Sites that were found to be more polluted had lower mean intensity and mean abundance of L. clariae, indicating pollution affects the survival of this ectoparasite.},

title={Landscape associations with native and invasive freshwater mussels},
abstract={Landscape impacts on aquatic organisms can play important roles in community structure and distributions, and landscape alteration can present unique challenges for organisms like freshwater mussels (Bivalvia: Unionidae) that can be compounded by the presence of invasive species. This study examined the impacts of landscape variables on native freshwater mussel and invasive Corbicula spp. distributions and densities in the Kalamazoo River watershed, MI, USA. Landscape impacts were analyzed at three spatial scales using GIS and regression tree analyses to determine factors influencing unionid and corbiculid densities. Results indicated that land use, geology, and longitudinal position in the watershed influence densities of unionids and corbiculids. In addition, corbiculid density was found to be important in determining unionid density and distribution at the reach scale. Results showed that landscape variables can influence invasive and native mussel species and emphasize the need to incorporate spatial information into our understanding of the relationships among organisms and their environments. The knowledge gained here contributes to evidence of the impacts that landscape can have on the abundance and distribution of both native and invasive organisms and provides insight into the associations of invasive Corbicula spp. with landscape variables and native unionids at multiple spatial scales.},

title={Assessing methods for mitigating fungal contamination in freshwater mussel in vitro propagation},
abstract={Many freshwater mussel species are critically imperiled, and propagation is essential for species <e2><80><98>recovery.<e2><80><99> Fungal contamination can negatively affect in vitro propagation of freshwater mussels; thus, we investigated methods of mitigating fungal contamination. Specifically, we tested the effect of medium replacement frequency and antifungal (Amphotericin B) concentrations on risk of fungal contamination and transformation success of two species, Alasmidonta heterodon and congener, Alasmidonta undulata. We observed a trend of increased contamination risk in treatment groups that received medium replacements every 1 or 2<c2><a0>days (vs. every 3<c2><a0>days), but this trend was not statistically significant. We found that contamination risk differed significantly across Amphotericin B concentrations. Although contamination severity reduced transformation success, we found no significant difference in transformation success based on medium replacement frequency. Amphotericin B concentration was negatively correlated with transformation success, suggesting toxicity at higher concentrations. Additionally, we identified the fungal pathogen (Candida parapsilosis), the first knowledge of this fungus during mussel culture. Our findings suggest that low contamination results in high probability for transformation success; however, there is a tradeoff in higher concentrations of Amphotericin B. This study offers new ideas for improving mussel propagation techniques that may better control fungal contamination and increase transformation success.},

abstract={Along European coasts, the rapid expansion of marine renewable energy devices and their buried power cables, raises major societal concerns regarding the potential effects of their magnetic field emissions (MFs) on marine species and ecosystem functioning. MFs occur at a local spatial scale, which makes sessile species the primary target of chronic and high-intensity exposures. Some of them, as ecosystem engineers, have critical functions in coastal habitats whose behavioral alteration may drive profound consequences at the ecosystem level. In this context, the<c2><a0>present experimental study explored the effects of short exposure to direct current MFs, on the feeding behavior of a widespread ecosystem engineer, the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis). A repeated measure design was carried out with adult mussels successively exposed to control treatment (ambient magnetic field of 47 <c2><b5>T) and artificial MF treatment (direct current of<c2><a0>300 <c2><b5>T produced by Helmholtz coils), as measured around power cables. The filtration activity was assessed through valve gap monitoring using an automated image analysis system. The clearance rate was estimated simultaneously by measuring the decrease in algal concentration using flow cytometry. Our findings revealed that mussels placed in MF treatment did not exhibit observable differences in valve activity and filtration rate, thus suggesting that, at such an intensity, artificial MFs do not significantly impair their feeding behavior. However, additional research is required to investigate the sensitivity of other life stages, the effects of mid to long-term exposure to alternative and direct current fields and to test various MF intensities.},

title={Dietary contributions of the alien zebra mussel <i>Dreissena polymorpha</i> in British freshwater fish suggest low biological resistance to their invasion},
abstract={Native communities can resist the establishment and invasion of alien species through consumptive and/or competitive interactions. The extent of consumptive resistance from freshwater fish to the invasion of zebra mussels Dreissena polymorpha, a globally invasive Ponto-Caspian species, was assessed in two areas in Britain using stable isotope analysis, where mixing models predicted the contribution of putative prey resources (including zebra mussel) to fish diet. Across the sites and species, only roach Rutilus rutilus were predicted to have a diet where zebra mussels contributed highly (predicted contribution: 44%), with literature suggesting that their functional morphology would have facilitated their consumption of this prey item. Predicted contributions of zebra mussels to common bream Abramis brama diet was comparatively low (29%), despite them being present to much larger sizes than roach, and with pike Esox lucius, perch Perca fluviatilis and pikeperch Sander lucioperca also predicted to have low dietary contributions of zebra mussels (0.08%, 24% and 24%, respectively). These results suggest the consumptive resistance to its invasion in Britain has been low and, correspondingly, if there is a management desire to further limit the invasion of zebra mussels then relying on biological resistance to limit their invasion appears to be insufficient.},

abstract={Abstract Marine heavy metal pollution is a worldwide serious issue. Like almost all Mediterranean lagoons, the Bizerte lagoon is highly urbanized and suffers from intensive anthropogenic pressure. In the present study, we screened the metal contamination and biomarker responses in the smooth scallop Flexopecten glaber inhabiting this vulnerable ecosystem. To this end, the concentrations of six heavy metals (HM) (i.e., Cu, Pb, Zn, Cd, Hg, and Fe) and a panel of biochemical endpoints including malondialdehyde (MDA), metallothioneins (MT), reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) were determined in the gills and digestive gland across seasons (warm and cold) and sites (S1 and S2). The distribution of almost all analyzed metals in F. glaber tissues varied significantly between sites, seasons, and organs. The highest levels were recorded at S2 during the warm period. Moreover, the digestive gland was found to accumulate greater concentrations of HM than the gills. Marked spatio-temporal variations were also observed for oxidative stress biomarkers, mainly in the gills, while the digestive gland seems to be rather sensitive to seasonal variability. Particularly, we noticed that among the used biomarkers, MT did not show significant variations in the two tested organs across seasons and sites. From the obtained results, F. glaber appears as a sensitive organism to anthropogenic metal contamination and can be proposed as a promising bioindicator species for marine pollution.},

title={Diel activity of littoral and epipelagic teleost fishes in the Mediterranean Sea},
abstract={Diel activity patterns are an important aspect of behavioural ecology, yet summarising works on diel activity patterns of fishes are lacking for several regions of the world, including the Mediterranean Sea. Based on a comprehensive review of literature, internet searches, citizen science and personal observations, we compile existing knowledge of diel activity of Mediterranean pelagic and demersal teleosts commonly occurring at depths shallower than 200<c2><a0>m as adults (393 native and 165 newcomer species, representing 124 families), using the categories strictly or mainly diurnal and nocturnal, crepuscular, cathemeral and diel vertical migration. Most of the available data refer to foraging activity patterns of adult fishes, while knowledge of time of reproduction, migratory movements, or territorial defence remains unknown for more than half of the species. Confamilial species often have the same activity pattern, although a high plasticity or diversity in diel activity patterns is seen in some families (Belonidae, Carangidae, Clupeidae, Gadidae, Gobiidae, Scombridae, Scorpaenidae, Sparidae, and Triglidae). We found correlations between adult feeding activity patterns and trophic level, habitat use and depth range: diurnal species have a lower trophic level, prefer shallower depths, and tend to occur over hard bottoms or have multi-habitat use, nocturnal species are mostly carnivorous and prefer soft bottoms in deeper waters, while cathemeral species are commonly carnivorous and pelagic. Our results do not support the hypothesis that nocturnal Indo-Pacific immigrants are more successful colonizers. The present work highlights the perils of over-generalizing activity patterns and shows that several gaps in knowledge of diel activity patterns of fishes remain despite that such knowledge can support conservation efforts.},

abstract={Eutrophication of water bodies and deterioration of water quality are emerging environmental crises. The root causes and consequences of eutrophication are multidirectional. Thus, they provide a huge scope of risk-analysis and risk-assessment in the domain of remediation studies. However, recent restoration studies reveal a global trend of utilizing traditional restoration methods combined with advanced pioneer innovative techniques developed in the field of science and technology. This review introduces a novel approach to consider ecohydrological assessment of eutrophication by classical biomanipulation practices emphasising on their evolution into innovative <e2><80><98>eco-bioengineering<e2><80><99> methods. The main objective of this study is to critically analyse and recognize the research gaps in classical biomanipulation and appreciate the reproducibility and efficacy of eco-bioengineering methods at micro- and macrolevel aquatic ecosystems. Comprehensive literature review was conducted on offline and online platforms. Our survey revealed (a) continuation of a historical trend in classical biomanipulation practices (61.64%) and (b) an ascending drift in eco-bioengineering research (38.36%) in the last decade (2010<e2><80><93>2021). At a global scale, recent biomanipulation research has a skewed distribution in Europe (41.10%), East Asia (32.88%), North America (10.96%), South Africa (4.11%), South America (2.74%), Middle East (1.37%), Oceania (1.37%), and non-specific regions (5.48%). Finally, this review analysis revealed the comprehensiveness of eco-bioengineering methods and their strong ecological resilience to recurrence of eutrophication and fluctuating environmental flows in the future. Therefore, our review reinforces the supremacy of eco-bioengineering methods as cost-effective green technologies providing sustainable solutions to restore the eutrophic waters at a global scale.},

title={Stable isotope analysis reveals trophic segregation between the invasive zebra mussel <i>Dreissena polymorpha</i> and the native duck mussel <i>Anodonta anatina</i> in Lake Trasimeno (Italy)},
abstract={Non-indigenous freshwater bivalves negatively affect invaded ecosystems through different mechanisms, including inter-specific competition for trophic resources. Here, we investigated in Lake Trasimeno (Central Italy) the diet of the invasive Dreissena polymorpha and the native Anodonta anatina. <ce><b4>15N and <ce><b4>13C stable isotopes were measured in winter and summer in bivalves, phytoplankton, and sedimentary organic matter (SOM); the relative dietary contributions of the two resources were determined using Bayesian mixing models. To elucidate the different carbon and nitrogen pools characterizing the study site, isotopic analyses were extended to zooplankton and to representatives of the benthic flora and macroinvertebrate fauna. Independently from the season, the two bivalves showed a limited trophic overlap, as mixing models indicated for D. polymorpha a diet based primarily on phytoplankton, while A. anatina relied mainly on SOM. Dietary differences were less marked in summer, when comparable isotopic values characterized phytoplankton and SOM. In winter, conversely, the trophic differentiation between the two species was more evident, and corresponded with a significant enrichment in SOM <ce><b4>13C values, likely due to a substantial contribution of carbon deriving from decaying macrophytes. Whether differences in ecological and behavioral traits alone can explain the observed trophic segregation between the two species, or if they have actively shifted their diet to reduce competition for food is discussed. We conclude emphasizing the need of an advanced resolution of the influence of non-indigenous species on the flux of energy and matter in invaded lentic systems, including Lake Trasimeno.},

abstract={Mytilopsis leucophaeata is an estuarine bivalve native from the Gulf of Mexico and possibly part of the eastern USA, which invaded many regions around the globe. Despite the previous discovery that two genetic lineages of this species exist, one comprising the northeastern USA and Eurasia and another having invaded South America, there were no genetic data about specimens from native areas. We reveal for the first time the COI signatures of two native populations of M. leucophaeata, one in the eastern coast of Florida, another in its western coast, besides analyzing the nuclear gene 28S. The COI sequences from South America (Venezuela and Brazil) are similar to those from Florida, mainly to the population from the western coast, whereas the clade composed of sequences from NE USA and Eurasia diverges by 2.4<e2><80><93>3.2% from remaining sequences. The 28S tree also confirmed the distinction of this lineage. We suspect that the cold-tolerant lineage may represent a distinct species originated in the mid-eastern or NE USA, possibly derived from glaciations or the formation of the Labrador Current, and having colonized Eurasia after human introductions. Based on data about ship trades, we also raise the hypothesis that the invasion in South America was composed of two stages, with an initial invasion in Venezuela or nearby Caribbean countries, followed by a secondary invasion in SE Brazil, although requiring further studies. These results may alter deeply our understanding about the invasion of M. leucophaeata around the globe.},

title={Assessment of shoreline restoration using macroinvertebrates in a Great Lakes Area of Concern},
abstract={Macroinvertebrate community assemblages were examined in three areas of the littoral zone of an impacted, drowned river mouth lake in west Michigan, USA. Muskegon Lake has an extensive history of environmental abuse, resulting in its listing as a Great Lakes Area of Concern. A multi-organizational, shoreline restoration initiative was started in 2009 and completed in 2012. Despite pre- and post-restoration monitoring of water quality, fish assemblages, and macrophytes, no studies had examined the shifts in the littoral zone macroinvertebrate community. Using Hester-Dendy samplers, we collected macroinvertebrates monthly in submergent, emergent, and open macrophyte zones, at two restored sites and one reference site from August 2018 to October 2019. No pre-restoration samples were collected at these sites but we could examine the changes in restored vs. reference sites. In total, 22,931 individuals were observed, with Gammarus spp., Echinogammarus spp., Chironominae, and Dreissena polymorpha being among the most abundant taxa. NMDS results revealed overlap among macroinvertebrate communities between the two restored sites and separation from the reference site, with some overlapping seasonal differences and communities influenced by macrophyte habitat type. Principal components analysis revealed that the environmental factors were strongly influenced by seasonal changes and drove habitat-level differences, rather than spatial variations among sites. Our results indicate that although the macroinvertebrate community composition at the restored sites differed from that at the reference site, the macroinvertebrate assemblage at each site was dominated by tolerant generalist species. Pollution-sensitive macroinvertebrate taxa may have been reduced or eliminated in the lake due to decades of environmental abuse. Periodic monitoring is recommended to determine if these sensitive taxa return, as Muskegon Lake conditions continue to improve.},

Mercenaria were exposed to temperatures from 24 to 34<c2><a0><c2><b0>C with 2.5<c2><a0><c2><b0>C/week, after which, gill transcriptomes were de novo assembled and annotated.

The upregulated genes in both species included those in chaperone-mediated protein folding and regulation of cell death pathways, while the downregulated genes in both species involved in mRNA processing and splicing pathways. Compared to M. mercenaria, M. campechiensis appears to be more sensitive to prolonged heat stress as indicated by upregulating significantly more genes in coping with oxidative stress and in the protein degradation pathways, while downregulating some inhibitors of apoptosis. We discussed this finding within their ecological and evolutionary context. Our findings highlighted the potential vulnerability of the two quahogs, especially the southern quahog, to continued ocean warming.},

abstract={Abstract The present study was conducted to determine the possible usage of dried Schizochytrium limacinum as a replacement of Arthrospira maxima in a ration of the adult freshwater mussel (Unio crassus). The experimental diets were prepared with the different concentrations of protein-rich green freshwater algae A. maxima and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-rich diatom S. limacinum.

The results showed that S. limacinum was digested by adult U. crassus to some extent and DHA was retained in the mussel tissue. These results showed that the dependence on live algae can be decreased in the conservation effort of U. crassus by using S. limacinum in a ration.},

abstract={Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) are an invasive species known to detrimentally affect native unionid mussels, a highly imperiled group of organisms. Yet, no study has compared the impact of infestation (direct attachment to unionid mussel shells) and presence of zebra mussels on glycogen storage under controlled conditions, nor examined the impact of zebra mussels at the southern edge of their North American distribution. Hence, the objectives of this study were to (1) examine the impact of infestation versus presence of zebra mussels with experiments in the laboratory and (2) collect data on glycogen concentrations of unionid mussels at field sites with and without zebra mussels. In the experiment, tissue samples were collected after 30<c2><a0>days from treatment tanks where (1) Threeridge (Amblema plicata) were artificially infested with zebra mussels, (2) zebra mussels were present with similar biomass, but shells of A. plicata were not infested, and (3) control tanks where zebra mussels were absent. Results from the experiments showed zebra mussel presence and infestation reduced glycogen by 38% and 66%, respectively. Results from the field were consistent with these findings. Variation in glycogen concentrations of mussels collected in the field was best explained by chlorophyll-a concentrations (coarse measure of food resource) and zebra mussel densities. Zebra mussels showed similar detrimental effects as in other studies despite their lower densities, which could be due to the additional metabolic costs associated with higher water temperatures. Our study suggests that the combined impact of invasive species and rising temperatures due to global warming needs to be considered for conservation and management plans.},

title={Creating informed consumers of aquatic invasive species management programs through online education for nonprofessionals},
abstract={There are limited educational opportunities regarding aquatic invasive species (AIS) management that target laypersons. This is a significant gap, particularly as nonprofessionals are often tasked with making decisions about whether and how to pursue AIS control efforts, for example, through their roles in community lake associations. Thus, there is a need for educational programs to help consumers of AIS management services, â€œdo-it-yourselfâ€ lakeshore homeowners, and other engaged nonprofessionals gain a stronger foundation in the science and practice of AIS management. We helped fill this unmet need through development of a new online course, AIS Management 101, that targets lakeshore property owners, lake association members, and other nonprofessionals engaged in AIS decision making, seeking to make them better-informed consumers. The course covers concepts ranging from basic invasive species biology to pesticide science, treatment evaluation, regulations and permitting, and nonchemical management tools. Participants in the course demonstrated significant knowledge gains through check-in and check-out knowledge assessments. Course participants also reported greater understanding of key issues pertaining to AIS management and application of this improved knowledge to actual management decisions following completion of the course. While this program focuses on management of aquatic invasive species, similar approaches could be applied to lay audiences engaged in management of terrestrial invasive species or other natural resource issues.},

title={Physical Circulation in the Coastal Zone of a Large Lake Controls the Benthic Biological Distribution},
abstract={Gradients of conductivity and major ions in the coastal zone of the eastern Georgian Bay of Lake Huron appear to limit the spatial distribution of invasive dreissenid mussels. Rivers flowing into Georgian Bay from the Canadian Shield have relatively low conductivity compared to the main body of Lake Huron, which creates a gradient of solutes near the river mouths. Field observations show a strong positive correlation between conductivity and calcium concentration. Thus, we use conductivity to infer the calcium concentrations required for the successful growth of dreissenid mussels. Most dreissenid mussels were observed in regions where specific conductivities were greater than 140<c2><a0><ce><bc>S/cm. Field observations were used to examine how the calcium poor river water mixes within the coastal zone, resulting in solute gradients that determine mussel distribution. When river flows are low in late summer, there is only a weak solute gradient across the coastal zone, implying an intrusion of open bay waters into the shallow embayments, that favor the growth of dreissenid mussels. In contrast, during spring when river flows are as much as 10 times higher, there is a strong solute gradient that extends further into the lake, and the low calcium appears to limit the growth of dreissenid mussels. Thus, the seasonal character of solute gradients helps describe the spatial distribution of dreissenid mussels and explains the localized absence of a species that is otherwise prevalent in much of the Laurentian Great Lakes.},

title={The alien octocoral <i>Carijoa riisei</i> is a biogenic substrate multiplier in artificial Brazilian shipwrecks},
abstract={Despite the obvious negative effects caused by invasive species, some recent studies have shown that the impacts at local scale are diverse and not necessarily negative. Arborescent benthic organisms such as octocorals form three-dimensional structures capable of increasing the amount of substrate available and providing shelter for epibiont species. We investigated the role of the alien octocoral Carijoa riisei on the diversity of benthic communities in three shipwrecks on the north-eastern coast of Brazil. We expected that (a) the fauna associated with the octocoral are richer and more diverse compared to the adjacent; (b) some species are exclusively associated with C. riisei; (c) the species that are present both in the areas with and without C. riisei have a greater abundance when associated with the octocoral. For this, we compared the macrobenthic communities associated with C. riisei to those found in adjacent areas where the octocoral was absent. Our study showed that the communities associated with the octocoral were 1.5 times richer and 10 times more abundant than adjacent communities, with 29 exclusive taxa. The dominant taxa were the amphipods Ericthonius brasiliensis and Podocerus brasiliensis and polychaetes of the family Syllidae. These taxa were present in areas with presence and absence of C. riisei, but their abundance was significantly greater where the octocoral was present. Our results reinforce the idea that Carijoa riisei acts as an ecosystem engineer in coastal reefs, creating new habitats and increasing diversity at a local scale, even though it is an alien species.},

As this area suffered a long-lasting contamination due to both organic and inorganic contaminants, a series of restoration activities were activated to tackle and to prevent potential risks for ecosystem and local population. Our results demonstrated that the levels of TEs accumulated in edible tissues of transplanted mussels in the Flekkefjord fjord were generally low before the beginning of the restoration activities. However, location- and time-specific differences in the<c2><a0>accumulation of TEs were noted after the implementation of such activities.

title={Sublethal Effects of Biogenic Silver Nanoparticles and Silver Nitrate in the Neotropical Fish <i>Prochilodus lineatus</i>: Is the Nanoform Really Less Toxic?},
abstract={Abstract Biogenic silver nanoparticles (bNAg) have been suggested as a less toxic alternative to ionic silver (Ag), and also a more ecological alternative to synthetic silver nanoparticles (sNAg). However, the differences between the sublethal effects caused by bNAg and silver nitrate (AgNO3) are hardly known, especially in native fishes of the Neotropical region. Most researchers have only compared the effects of sNAg and AgNO3. Thus, the objective of this work was to evaluate the effects of bNAg, produced by the fungus Fusarium oxysporum, and to compare these with the effects of AgNO3 in the Neotropical fish Prochilodus lineatus. The animals were exposed for 24 and 96<c2><a0>h at nominal concentrations of 10 and 25<c2><a0><c2><b5>g<c2><a0>L<e2><88><92>1 of Ag. At the end of the exposures, Ag accumulation, metallothionein concentration, hematological parameters, plasma glucose and ion concentrations, activity of the main ATPases and carbonic anhydrase in the gills, enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants, lipid peroxidation, and neurotoxic effects were evaluated. Both bNAg and AgNO3 caused Ag accumulation in the blood, gills, and brain, in addition to neurotoxic effects on muscle, alterations in reduced glutathione concentration in the gills, and increased glutathione-S-transferase activity in the liver. Hyperglycemia, ionic imbalances, and alterations in the activity of ion transport enzymes in the gills were also observed. As the effects of bNAg were similar to the effects of AgNO3, it is concluded that animals exposed to the highest concentration of silver were the most affected, regardless of the form of silver used in the exposure medium.},

title={Invasive Dreissena Mussel Coastal Transport From an Already Invaded Estuary to a Nearby Archipelago Detected in DNA and Zooplankton Surveys},
abstract={Coastal waters of Lake Superior are generally inhospitable to the establishment of invasive Dreissena spp. mussels (both D. polymorpha and D. bugensis). Dreissena have inhabited the Saint Louis River estuary (SLRE; largest commercial port in the Laurentian Great Lakes) for over 3 decades, but only in the last few years have small colonies been found in the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore (APIS), an archipelago situated 85 km to the east of SLRE) A 2017 survey determined a low abundance Dreissena spatial distribution in APIS, with the largest colonies on the north and west islands which suggested potential veliger transport from the SLRE via longshore currents. Our objective in this study was to determine if Dreissena veligers are transported by currents at low densities along the south shore of Lake Superior from the SLRE to APIS. To do so, we used both eDNA (water and passive substrate samples) and zooplankton collection methods at 8 sites evenly spaced between the SLRE and APIS with 3 sampling times over 5 weeks. Dreissena veligers were consistently detected along the south shore, although at low abundances (veligers per m3 range=0 â€“ 690, median=8), and for every 1 km increase in distance from the SLRE, both veliger counts and water eDNA copy numbers decreased on average by 5% and 7%, respectively. D. polymorpha (suited to estuary habitats) was detected 2 times more than D. bugensis (better suited to deep-lake habitats). There was not a trend in the veliger size distribution along the south shore, and temperature and calcium concentrations fluctuated around the threshold for Dreissena veliger and adult development, averaging 11.0 â„ƒ and 14.8 ppm, respectively. Three zooplankton taxa representative of the estuary community--Daphnia retrocurva, Diaphanosoma birgei, and Mesocyclops copepodites--decreased as the distance from the SLRE increased mirroring Dreissena veliger abundance patterns. Findings represent multiple sources of evidence of a propagule â€œconveyor beltâ€ for Dreissena along the south shore of Lake Superior. We conclude that veligers are functioning as a propagule, using coastal currents to spread from the point of invasion, thereby traversing coastal habitat previously reported as inhospitable to distant habitats suitable for colonization.},

title={Development of a Binary Digestion System for Extraction Microplastics in Fish and Detection Method by Optical Photothermal Infrared},
abstract={Accumulating evidence indicates that aquatic organisms ingest microplastics (MPs), which may be a threat to essentially the entire global ecosystem. In current detection methods, even in cutting-edge nanoplastic technology, a major challenge for detecting microplastics (MPs) in aquatic organisms is removing complex biological matrices, such as fat. Herein we report combining HNO3 and H2O2 to form a binary digestive reagent system to determine MPs in biological tissue. With insights obtained from a Gaussian model, the adding manners of two reagents were discussed. Thus, in the final protocol, we mixed MPs and tissue with 20 mL of 30% (v/v) aqueous H2O2, 10 mL 0.5 M NaOH,1 mL 5 mM Fe2+, and 40 mL 11.5% (v/v) aqueous HNO3, in sequence at different time intervals. What<e2><80><99>s more, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and ultrasound<e2><80><94>alone or together<e2><80><94>were explored to solve the problem of removing fat residues and thus membrane blockage during filtration. In this paper, we used the O-PTIR microscope to verify the feasibility of the protocol. Compared with traditional detection methods, the O-PTIR spectroscopy can significantly improve the lateral resolution, down to sub and super-micrometer, and the ability to quickly obtain high spatial resolution far-field non-contact infrared spectra, which provide a novel method for qualitative analysis of MPs. In field applications, in our attempt, the fixed wavenumber image by O-PTIR can realize sub and super-micrometer MPs in-situ, far-field measurements. The present method is highly efficient, and facilitates the identification of plastic particles.},

To achieve such a task, biological invasion researchers and practitioners take advantage of numerous technologies (e.g. genomics and acoustic telemetry). Surprisingly, the study of invasive fish ecology by analysis of the chemical composition of calcium carbonate hard parts (e.g. otoliths and scales) remains underutilized, despite some convincing examples of successful applications in the scientific literature. Among its most common applications in invasion biology, otolith chemistry has been used to identify natal origins, reconstruct migratory behaviour and assess mixed-stock structure. In this literature review, we provide a general overview of those previous applications but more importantly identify some gaps and obstacles to applications of otolith chemistry in invasion biology and suggest development for innovative applications, including use in wildlife forensic sciences and reconstruction of the early dynamics of invasions.},

title={Evaluating essential processes and forecast requirements for meteotsunami-induced coastal flooding},
abstract={Meteotsunamis pose a unique threat to coastal communities and often lead to damage of coastal infrastructure, deluge of nearby property, and loss of life and injury. The Great Lakes are a known hot-spot of meteotsunami activity and serve as an important region for investigation of essential hydrodynamic processes and model forecast requirements in meteotsunami-induced coastal flooding. For this work, we developed an advanced hydrodynamic model and evaluate key model attributes and dynamic processes, including: (1) coastal model grid resolution and wetting and drying process in low-lying zones, (2) coastal infrastructure, including breakwaters and associated submerging and overtopping processes, (3) annual/seasonal (ambient) water level change, and (4) wind wave-current coupling. Numerical experiments are designed to evaluate the importance of these attributes to meteotsunami modeling, including a â€œrepresentative stormâ€ scenario in the context of regional climate change in which a meteotsunami wave is generated under high ambient lake-level conditions with a preferable wind direction and speed for wind-wave growth. Results demonstrate that accurate representation of coastal topography and fully resolving associated hydrodynamic processes are critical to forecasting the realistic hazards associated with meteotsunami events. As most of existing coastal forecast systems generally do not resolve many of these features due to insufficient model grid resolution or lack of essential model attributes, this work shows that calibrating or assessing existing forecast models against coastal water level gauges alone may result in underestimating the meteotsunami hazard, particularly when gauging stations are sparse and located behind harbor breakwaters or inside estuaries, which represent dampened or otherwise unrepresentative pictures of meteotsunami intensity. This work is the first hydrodynamic modeling of meteotsunami-induced coastal flooding for the Great Lakes, and serves as a template to guide where resources may be most beneficial in forecast system development and implementation.},

title={Contribution of invasive bivalves (<i>Dreissena</i> spp.) to element distribution: phase interaction, regional and seasonal comparison in a large shallow lake},
abstract={After introduction, the invasive bivalve dreissenids became key species in the biota of Lake Balaton, the largest shallow lake in Central Europe. The contribution of dreissenid soft tissue and shell, as biotic phases, in element distribution and its interaction with the water and upper sediment phases were examined in two basins with different trophic conditions in spring and autumn. Six metals (Ba, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb, Zn) were detected in all investigated phases. In general, metals were abundant in the water and soft tissue in the eastern basin in spring, and in the sediment and shells in the western basin in autumn. This might be associated with the more urbanized surroundings in the eastern, and the enhanced organic matter production in the western basin. High relative shares of Ba, Cu, Mn, and Pb were associated with the water and shell samples, whereas high shares of Fe and Zn were noted in the soft mussel tissue and sediments. Results suggest that dynamics of metal uptake by dreissenids depend on the seasonal change in metabolic activity. Shell metal content is less changeable; shells might absorb metals from both the soft tissue and water phases. Metallothionein peptides, the scavengers of intracellular metals, were determined to be biomarkers of the bulk contaminants rather than only metals. The present study shows that invasive bivalves, with high abundance, filtering activity, and storing capacity can significantly contribute to element distribution in the shoreline of a shallow lake ecosystem.},

To cope with stress, many organisms locally adapt, but how such adaptations affect the ability of an organism to manage co-occurring stressors is not well understood. In aquatic ecosystems, elevated temperatures and harmful algal blooms are common co-stressors. To better understand the role and potential trade-offs of local adaptations for mitigating the effects of stressors, Daphnia pulicaria genotypes that varied in their ability to consume toxic cyanobacteria prey (i.e., three tolerant and three sensitive) were exposed to five diets that included combinations of toxic cyanobacteria, Microcystis aeruginosa, and a<c2><a0>green alga, Ankistrodesmus falcatus, under two temperatures (20<c2><a0><c2><b0>C vs. 28<c2><a0><c2><b0>C). A path analysis was conducted to understand how local adaptations affect energy allocation to intermediate life history traits (i.e., somatic growth, fecundity, survival) that maximize Daphnia fitness (i.e., population growth rate). Results from the 10-day study show that tolerant Daphnia genotypes had higher fitness than sensitive genotypes regardless of diet or temperature treatment, suggesting toxic cyanobacteria tolerance did not cause a decrease in fitness in the absence of cyanobacteria or under elevated temperatures. Results from the path analysis demonstrated that toxic cyanobacteria had a stronger effect on life history traits than temperature and that population growth rate was mainly constrained by reduced fecundity. These findings suggest that local adaptations to toxic cyanobacteria and elevated temperatures are synergistic, leading to higher survivorship of cyanobacteria-tolerant genotypes during summer cyanobacterial bloom events.},

abstract={Changes in seasonal cycles (i.e., phenology), can cause mismatches throughout aquatic food webs and often are used as the primary indicator of zooplankton response to environmental changes. However, zooplankton phenology has been largely overlooked in Lake Michigan despite the altered phenology of phytoplankton, including the disappearance of the offshore spring phytoplankton bloom following Dreissena mussel invasions.Multiple measures of phenology were evaluated for the major zooplankton groups in offshore southeastern Lake Michigan both before the loss of the spring bloom (1983<e2><80><93>2003), and after the spring bloom had disappeared (2007<e2><80><93>2019). Water temperatures in spring did not differ between time periods.Standardised biomass declined between time periods for all zooplankton groups in spring and for total zooplankton and the cladoceran Daphnia in the summer. Changes in zooplankton phenology varied across groups and depended on the phenological measures used. Month of peak biomass shifted later for all groups, but the central point of the growing season did not change for any group between time periods. The onset of population development was delayed only for the copepod Limnocalanus.Spring chlorophyll concentrations combined with spring water temperatures provided the best predictions of population onset for Limnocalanus and Daphnia. The central point of the growing season varied with spring chlorophyll concentrations for Limnocalanus, but with spring water temperature for Daphnia.Changes in zooplankton phenology were relatively subtle compared to the large changes observed for spring chlorophyll concentrations. By contrast, there were fairly consistent declines in zooplankton biomass across groups that were associated with the declines in spring chlorophyll either alone or in combination with spring water temperature. This may mean that food limitation has a stronger influence on zooplankton biomass or production than on zooplankton phenology in offshore Lake Michigan.Based on our results from Lake Michigan, alterations such as nutrient reduction or invasive dreissenid mussel filtering that lead to declines in spring phytoplankton blooms in other large freshwater lakes could result in subtle delays in zooplankton phenology for some groups along with stronger declines in zooplankton biomass.},

The objective of this study was to evaluate whether the common freshwater bivalve Anodonta anatina (duck mussel) could remove the bacterial fish pathogen Flavobacterium columnare from the water. Mussels reduced bacteria in both of the two experiments performed, so that the bacterial concentration at the end of the 96-h monitoring in mussel treatments was only 0.3<e2><80><93>0.5 times that of the controls. Surprisingly, mussels did not reduce algal cell concentration statistically significantly. Mussel behavior (shell openness, foot position, and movement) was not affected by the presence of bacteria or algae, except for biodeposition formation, which was greatest in algal-fed treatments, followed by bacterial-fed treatments and controls, respectively. The intestines of bacteria-incubated A. anatina harbored F. columnare, suggesting that mussels ingested the bacteria. Present results suggest that freshwater mussels may also have a potential to mitigate aquaculture pathogen problems, as well as play a role in water quality management.},

abstract={The role of grazing as a controlling factor of phytoplankton has an extensive debate in the literature. In this article, five mechanisms that have been explored as potential controlling factors of grazing influence on phytoplankton in South America are discussed and compared with other latitudinal works. The temperature impact on zooplankton is not conclusive, with planktivorous fish appearing as the main controlling factor of zooplankton size ranges. Fish grazing effects on phytoplankton look despicable, but the impact of exotic filter-feeding fish remains controversial. Microphagous rotifers and Copepoda nauplii affect phytoplankton by selective size grazing, while large Cladocera and Copepoda adults can control phytoplankton when they reach high densities in the absence of fish. Both groups mainly feed on small sizes, with microzooplankton having a higher impact on very small phytoplankton. Some contradictory evidence arises for large colonial and filamentous algae. Exotic invasive filter-feeding bivalves are selective grazers in experimental approximations. Corbicula fluminea feeds on smaller particles, does not have taxonomic preferences, and has lower densities in nature than Limnoperna fortunei. Their effect on nature is not fully documented. In sum, several aspects still need deep scrutiny to fully understand the role of grazing on phytoplankton in South America.},

Moreover, the fish differed in their anti-predation behaviour: the gudgeon increased whilst the monkey goby decreased inter-individual distances and only the gudgeon exhibited thigmotaxis and reduced mobility in response to the conspecific cues. Interspecific differences show that the species exhibit distant anti-predation strategies. This might be associated with their phylogenetic distance and/or higher differentiation of their ecological niches than commonly assumed. Besides, our results suggest that alien species be included in the interspecific exchange of information in local fish assemblages.},

As a result, biodegradation was the main removal mechanism in activated sludge for both pharmaceutical compounds, followed by sorption and desorption. The highest removals of CLA and GFZ were 72 and 97%, respectively. According to results from the adsorption test, the CLA and GFZ have a strong adsorption capacity on inactivated biomass. The solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd) for CLA was 8.5 L<c2><b7>g<e2><88><92>1 and for GFZ was 0.75 L<c2><b7>g<e2><88><92>1. The value for Monod constants qmax was 0.6<c2><a0>h<e2><88><92>1 for both pharmaceutical compounds. The affinity constant Ks value of CLA (4.37<c2><a0><c2><b5>g.L<e2><88><92>1) was higher than the Ks value of GFZ (0.35<c2><a0><c2><b5>g<c2><b7>L<e2><88><92>1). COD and NH4<e2><80><93>N removals were 99 and 97%, respectively, during the kinetic test.},

title={Modelling the abundance of a non-native mollusk in tropical semi-arid reservoirs},
abstract={This study aimed to investigate the relative importance of abiotic factors and biotic resistance (expressed as species richness of native macroinvertebrates), through a correlative niche-based model, to explain the abundance of the non-native mollusk Melanoides tuberculata. A total of 478 sites were sampled in six reservoirs in a Brazilian semi-arid region in June, September, December (2014) and March (2015). A niche-based model (BRT's), which included all tested predictor variables explained 41.7% total variation in M. tuberculata abundance. Water depth had the highest relative importance (19.0% of relative contribution) followed by temperature (17.2%) and sediment organic matter content (15.4%). The native macroinvertebrate richness explained only 8.0%, evidencing the smaller role of biotic resistance in explaining M. tuberculata abundance. Our results suggest that factors associated with the extent of species<e2><80><99> niches are more important and can determine the multiple invasion processes of this mollusk, especially in terms of population growth and spread. The low explanatory power of biotic resistance on the abundance and distribution of the invasive mollusk may not necessarily indicate a lack of resistance by the native community, and M. tuberculata is not widespread enough to occupy the total potential range.},

title={Spatio-temporal and intra-specific variations in the physiological and biochemical condition of the invasive bivalve <i>Corbicula fluminea</i>},
abstract={Corbicula fluminea is a known aquatic invasive species responsible for several ecological and economic impacts. In Portugal, it is found in all major watersheds, although to varying degrees of invasion (regarding density, biomass and spatial distribution). The aim of this study was to evaluate the spatio-temporal differences in condition indices (CIs) and biochemical composition (proteins, lipids and energy) of individuals collected in Lima (low invasion) and Minho (high invasion) Rivers, as well as the effects of intra-specific competition (densities: 150, 500, 1000 individuals/m2) on the CIs of C. fluminea. CIs and biochemical composition varied between rivers and over time, with populations in Lima and Minho showing different patterns. Corbicula fluminea in Lima River had higher CIs and lower densities with more individuals of larger size, while individuals in Minho River had lower CIs and high densities with a more uniform size distribution. The intra-specific competition experiment showed that the optimum of C. fluminea was reached at 500 individuals/m2 density, possibly related to the species ability of enrich sediments with organic matter, leading to a positive feedback on phytoplankton and/or microbial communities. This study improves the understanding of the ecophysiological conditions of C. fluminea populations, a topic neglected in previous studies.},

title={Determination of the pharmaceuticalsâ€“nano/microplastics in aquatic systems by analytical and instrumental methods},
abstract={Pharmaceutical residues and nanoplastic and microplastic particles as emerging pollutants in the aquatic environment are a subject of increasing concern in terms of the effect on water sources and marine organisms. There is lack of information about pharmaceutical<e2><80><93>nanoplastic and pharmaceutical<e2><80><93>microplastic mixtures. The present study aimed to investigate the fate and effect of pharmaceutical residues and nanoplastic and microplastic particles, the results of combinations of pharmaceutical residues with nanoplastic and microplastic particles, and toxic effects of pharmaceutical residues and nanoplastic and microplastic particles. Moreover, the objective was also to introduce analytical methods for pharmaceuticals, along with instrumental techniques for nanoplastic and microplastic particles in aquatic environments and organisms. PhAC alone can affect marine environments and aquatic organisms. When pharmaceutical residues combine with nanoplastic and microplastic particles, the rate of toxicity increases, and the result of this phenomenon constitutes this kind of pollutant in wastewater. Hence, the rate of mortality in organisms enhances. This study aimed to investigate the effect of pharmaceuticals residues and nanoplastic and microplastic particles, and a mixture of pharmaceutical residues and nanoplastic and microplastic particles in aquatic biota. Another object was survey methods for recognizing pharmaceutical residues and nanoplastic and microplastic particles. The findings show that pharmaceutical residues in organisms caused cell structure damage, inflammatory response, and nerve cell apoptosis. This study aimed to investigate the effect of microplastic particles in the human food chain and their impact on human health. Moreover, this review aims to present an innovative methodology based on comprehensive analytical techniques used to determine and identify pharmaceuticals adsorbed on nano- and microplastics in aquatic ecosystems. Finally, this review addresses the knowledge gaps and provides insights into future research strategies to better understand their interactions.},

title={Experimental Analysis of Survival and Recovery of Ship Fouling Mussels During Transit Between Marine and Freshwaters},
abstract={Ships and boats may transport whole communities of non-indigenous species through hull biofouling, some members of which may become invasive. Several studies have evaluated the diversity of these communities, but very few have analyzed the survival of organisms after their voyages into different and potentially inhospitable conditions. This factor is important to consider because the last port of call approach for risk assessments assumes that if the conditions observed in the last port of call are different from those observed in a receiving port, risks are diminished or null. Using an innovative experimental system, we tested the survival and recovery of the marine blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) and the freshwater zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) by exposing them to adverse salinity conditions at varying temperatures to simulate ships and boats transiting to ports or marinas with contrasting environmental conditions. Both mussel species, which are well-known for their adaptability to new environments as aquatic non-indigenous species, survived better at colder temperatures, with blue mussels surviving up to 14 days in freshwater, and zebra mussels up to 8 days in marine water. This highlights the importance of considering the resistance of fouling organisms to adverse conditions in vector and species risk assessments.},

title={Climate and Land Use Driven Ecosystem Homogenization in the Prairie Pothole Region},
abstract={The homogenization of freshwater ecosystems and their biological communities has emerged as a prevalent and concerning phenomenon because of the loss of ecosystem multifunctionality. The millions of prairie-pothole wetlands scattered across the Prairie Pothole Region (hereafter PPR) provide critical ecosystem functions at local, regional, and continental scales. However, an estimated loss of 50% of historical wetlands and the widespread conversion of grasslands to cropland make the PPR a heavily modified landscape. Therefore, it is essential to understand the current and potential future stressors affecting prairie-pothole wetland ecosystems in order to conserve and restore their functions. Here, we describe a conceptual model that illustrates how (a) historical wetland losses, (b) anthropogenic landscape modifications, and (c) climate change interact and have altered the variability among remaining depressional wetland ecosystems (i.e., ecosystem homogenization) in the PPR. We reviewed the existing literature to provide examples of wetland ecosystem homogenization, provide implications for wetland management, and identify informational gaps that require further study. We found evidence for spatial, hydrological, chemical, and biological homogenization of prairie-pothole wetlands. Our findings indicate that the maintenance of wetland ecosystem multifunctionality is dependent on the preservation and restoration of heterogenous wetland complexes, especially the restoration of small wetland basins.},

The study will prove if Torun and its Vistula stretch represent a viable and profitable spot on this inland waterway, and its outcomes will constitute a sound baseline that can be used for the project itself but also for many scientific, educational and economic purposes. The eco-multilayer research will comprise the following elements: hydrology and biology of the Torunian Vistula (TV) stretch, and water quality; a public opinion survey; the urban functions of the TV segment (social, educational, urban planning, aesthetical, recreational, cultural, utilitarian and economical). The conclusion is that the eco-research and the project will improve Torun City<e2><80><99>s image as a Green Urban Space, in terms of respect towards the environment, a sustainable form of transport, and attractive ways of relaxation and spending leisure time by Torun<e2><80><99>s population and visitors. The eco-study and the project will contribute to promoting the Torun region by supporting the possibility of watching beautiful landscapes (sightseeing tours) spread along the Vistula River.

abstract={Sunscreens have become a product based on increasingly complex formulations that include, among many ingredients, a mixture of UV filters to provide optimal sun ultraviolet radiation protection. A significant group of scientific works deals with the impact of UV filters in aquatic media. However, the knowledge of the mechanism and kinetics of the compound<e2><80><99>s direct release, fate, and its transformation and interaction with living organisms is necessary to assess its environmental occurrence and behavior and to predict potential and real impacts on the aquatic environment. This review outlines the existing analysis and modeling of the release and behavior of sunscreen<e2><80><99>s ingredients in the marine environment, including aquatic organisms. The physical-chemical properties, photodegradation, and release kinetics of particles and chemicals into the water are studied by hydrodynamic and kinetic models. Direct photolysis of chemicals is modeled as pseudo-first-order kinetics, while the indirect pathway by the reaction of sunscreen with reactive oxygen species is described as second-order kinetics. The interaction of UV filters with marine biota is studied mainly by toxicokinetic models, which predict their bio-accumulation in the organisms<e2><80><99> tissues. These models consider the chemicals<e2><80><99> uptake and excretion, as well as their transfer between different internal animal organs, as a first-order kinetic process. The studies analyzed in the present work represent a driver of change for the beauty and personal care industry, in order to seek new ecological alternatives through the application of R&D tactics.},

title={Cyanobacterial Bloom Phenology in Green Bay Using MERIS Satellite Data and Comparisons with Western Lake Erie and Saginaw Bay},
abstract={Cyanobacteria blooms have been reported to be increasing worldwide. In addition to potentially causing major economic and ecological damage, these blooms can threaten human health. Furthermore, these blooms can be exacerbated by a warming climate. One approach to monitoring and modeling cyanobacterial biomass is to use processed satellite imagery to obtain long-term data sets. In this paper, an existing algorithm for estimating cyanobacterial biomass previously developed for MERIS is validated for Green Bay using cyanobacteria biovolume estimates obtained from field samples. Once the algorithm was validated, the existing MERIS imagery was used to determine the bloom phenology of the cyanobacterial biomass in Green Bay. Modeled datasets of heat flux (as a proxy for stratification), wind speed, water temperature, and gelbstoff absorption along with in situ river discharge data were used to separate bloom seasons in Green Bay from bloom seasons in nearby cyanobacteria bloom hotspots including western Lake Erie and Saginaw Bay. Of the ten-year MERIS dataset used here, the highest five years were considered â€œhigh bloomâ€ years, and the lowest five years from biomass were considered â€œlow bloomâ€ years and these definitions were used to separate Green Bay. Green Bay had a strong relationship with gelbstoff absorption making it unique among the water bodies, while western Lake Erie responded strongly with river discharge as previously reported. Saginaw Bay, which has low interannual bloom variability, did not exhibit a largely influential single parameter.},

title={Land snails Brephulopsis cylindrica and Xeropicta derbentina (Gastropoda: Stylommatophora): case study of invasive species distribution modelling},
abstract={The terrestrial snails Brephulopsis cylindrica and Xeropicta derbentina are native to steppes of the Northern Black Sea region; X. derbentina has also initially inhabited Eastern Mediterranean, the Caucasus, and Anatolia. However, in last decades the species are increasingly reported outside of their natural range which renders them as likely invasive. The paper aims to assess the ecological suitability of adjacent habitats in terms of the molluscs invasion. We address this using species distribution modelling (SDM). The selected environment predictors for SDM included 22 environment factors such as land cover, enhanced vegetation index (EVI), altitude, and 19 bioclimatic parameters. The resulted model suggests that the area with maximum suitability extends from the natural range to the Central Danube lowland in the West and up to the Volga Upland in the Northeast. These regions have similar EVI and are largely croplands. Among the predictors, the minimum temperature of the coldest month has the greatest impact on the modelling results, which agrees with the variable being the limiting factor for the distribution of subtropical invertebrates. The study reinforces the notions that X. derbentina and B. cylindrica are likely to further expand the boundaries of their range thus posing threats to native ecosystems.Alternate abstract:ÐÐ°Ð·ÐµÐ¼Ð½Ñ‹Ðµ Ð¼Ð¾Ð»Ð»ÑŽÑÐºÐ¸ Brephulopsis cylindrica Ð¸ Xeropicta derbentina Ð¸ÑÐºÐ¾Ð½Ð½Ð¾ Ð½Ð°ÑÐµÐ»ÑÑŽÑ‚ ÑÑ‚ÐµÐ¿Ð½Ñ‹Ðµ Ð±Ð¸Ð¾Ñ‚Ð¾Ð¿Ñ‹ Ð¡ÐµÐ²ÐµÑ€Ð½Ð¾Ð³Ð¾ ÐŸÑ€Ð¸Ñ‡ÐµÑ€Ð½Ð¾Ð¼Ð¾Ñ€ÑŒÑ.

title={Metal Content and Enrichment in Bivalves within the Drainage Area of Seawater Used for a Desulfurization Process in Zhanjiang Bay, China},
abstract={As heavy metals are easy to accumulate and have strong biological toxicity, they pose a potential threat to human health by entering the human body through the cumulative effect of marine life. Land-based input is an important source of heavy metals in the ocean, which has a great influence on coastal water quality. In this study, the spatial distribution characteristics of heavy metals (Zn, Cu, Cd, Pb, Cr, As) in the coastal waters of the desulfurization process outlet of a power plant in Zhanjiang Bay were investigated, and the enrichment behavior of heavy metals by organisms (oysters and barnacles) were also studied. The results showed that, before the seawater desulfurization system was closed, there were high concentrations of heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb and Cr) in the surface seawater near the drainage outlet. The concentrations of these heavy metals in the surface seawater were higher than those in the bottom seawater within 100 m of the drainage outlet. After the seawater desulfurization system was closed, the average concentrations of Cu, Cr and As in seawater at each station decreased by 17.04%, 37.52% and 29.53%, respectively, while the average concentrations of Zn, Cd and Pb increased by 17.05%, 32.87% and 48.77%, respectively. Single factor pollution index (SFI) and bio-concentration factor (BCF) showed that there was a potential high accumulation risk of Zn in oysters and barnacles near the drainage outlet of desulfurization wastewater (0.5 < SFI < 1 and BCF > 1000). The SFI and BCF of each metal in oysters and barnacles decreased with the increase in distance from the drainage outlet. Generally, the coastal water quality of desulfurization process drainage area in Zhanjiang Bay were below the class â…¡of the â€œSeawater quality standardâ€ (GB 3097-1997) of China. However, the heavy metals content in seawater and organisms near the drainage outlet is slightly higher. This suggested that if the seawater desulfurization process runs for a long time, it will have a negative impact on the coastal water and organisms.},

abstract={The environmental concentrations and aquatic toxicity of a range of technology-critical metals comprising platinum group and rare earth group elements, together with gallium, germanium, indium, lithium, niobium, rhenium, tantalum, tellurium and thallium, have been reviewed to determine whether they pose a risk to aquatic ecosystem health. There is a reasonable body of toxicity data for most, but the quality is quite variable, and more data are required. Chronic toxicity EC10 or NOEC values are generally in the low mg L<e2><80><93>1 range, far higher than the current environmental concentrations in the ng L<e2><80><93>1 range, meaning that the existing risks to ecosystem health are extremely low. Missing are reliable toxicity data for niobium and tantalum, while confounding results for lanthanum toxicity need to be resolved. There is a likelihood that the currently low concentrations of most of these elements will increase in future years. Whether these concentrations are in bioavailable forms remains to be reliably determined. For most of the elements, measured speciation information is scarce, and unfortunately the thermodynamic data required to calculate their speciation are incomplete. In addition to this problem of uncertain speciation for some of these metals, notably those present in oxidation states of III or higher, there is also a need to explore the links between speciation and bioavailability for these higher valence metals. For circumneutral solutions, the calculated concentrations of the free metal ion tend to be very low for these metals and under such conditions the link between metal speciation and bioavailability is unclear.},

title={Invasive Alien Species of Benthic Macroinvertebrates and Fish in the Bulgarian Sector of the Danube Riverâ€”Results of the Joint Danube Survey 4 (JDS4)},
abstract={The aim of this study was to assess the status of aquatic invasive alien species (IAS) in the shoreline zone of the Bulgarian sector of the Danube River, Danube tributaries, and adjacent standing water bodies in the frame of the Joint Danube Survey 4 (JDS4). Seven benthic macroinvertebrates and seven fish IAS were identified. The crayfish Faxonius limosus was frequently found and abundant in the tributaries. The mussels Corbicula fluminea, Dreissena rostriformis bugensis, and Sinanodonta woodiana dominated in the Danube River and the middle and lower reaches of the tributaries, while the fish Carassius gibelio, Perccottus glenii, and Lepomis gibbosus were most abundant in the standing water bodies. The integrated biocontamination estimated by taxonomic groups (crayfish, molluscs, and fish), sampling methods, and type of water bodies ranged from moderate in the shoreline zone of the Danube River, through moderate to high in the canals and lakes, to severe in the Danube tributaries and the reservoirs. The results demonstrate the importance of IAS in the assessment of the ecological status/potential of the water bodies in the DRB. The comprehensive evaluation of the aquatic IAS pressure will provide valuable information and support for the implementation of the national and EU IAS and water policies in the DRB.},

title={Improvement of Water Quality by Light-Emitting Diode Illumination at the Bottom of a Field Experimental Pond},
abstract={Remediation of water quality by stimulating algal photosynthesis using light-emitting diodes (LEDs) has attracted attention, but few studies have examined this in outdoor freshwater environments. To understand the effects of LED illumination on water quality, the dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, pH, and electric conductivity were monitored over 5 months in three depressions with or without a red/blue LED light at the bottom of an experimental pond. The effects of the blue LED on water quality were evident in the period with less rainfall after the change of water quality to an equilibrium state; DO and pH were higher, and EC was lower for the blue LED than for the control. The diel changes of these variables were also lower for the blue LED. The effects of the red LED on DO and pH were also evident, but to a lesser extent compared to those of the blue LED. A vertical mixing of water associated with a nighttime cooling of the surface water was suggested by a rapid DO increase after a temperature decrease in the control. Such internal water circulation and an inflow of water after rainfall might have obscured the LED effects in the rainy period. The bottom water of the blue LED had a higher density and species richness of phytoplankton than that of the control at the end of the experiment. A lower density of phytoplankton and higher nutrient concentrations in the red LED might have been due to a higher density and feeding activity by zooplankton. Our results confirmed the applicability of LED illumination in stimulating algal photosynthesis, and in improving the oxygen condition of the bottom water in freshwater ponds.},

title={Filamentous Algae Blooms in a Large, Clear-Water Lake: Potential Drivers and Reduced Benthic Primary Production},
abstract={An apparent proliferation of filamentous algal blooms (FABs) in pristine lakes around the world is a source of concern. However, little is known about the predominant drivers and effects of such FABs on lake ecosystems. We observed FABs in a large clear-water lake (Bear Lake, UT/ID, USA) and analyzed long-term lake monitoring data and algal stable isotopes for changes in climate, food webs and anthropogenic nutrient loading, respectively, as potential local drivers of FAB formation. Furthermore, we quantified in situ metabolism rates on rocks with and without FABs at two locations. Long-term monitoring data revealed increasing summer water temperatures (2009 to 2020) and decreasing winter ice cover (1923 to 2021). The FABs had <ce><b4>15N values that were higher than 0 <e2><80><b0>, indicating a potential nutrient influx to Bear Lake from livestock or human waste. Climate change and anthropogenic nutrients may thus have facilitated FAB occurrence. Contrary to expectation, the FABs exhibited significantly lower gross primary production rates compared to low-biomass periphyton communities, indicating potentially negative effects of FAB proliferations on lake food webs. Our results highlight the need for expanding lake monitoring programs to include littoral zones to detect and mitigate changes occurring in lakes.},

title={Improving Environmental DNA Sensitivity for Dreissenid Mussels by Targeting Tandem Repeat Regions of the Mitochondrial Genome},
abstract={The recent genetic revolution through the analysis of aquatic environmental DNA (eDNA) has become a powerful tool for improving the detection of rare and/or invasive species. For the majority of eDNA studies, genetic assays are designed to target mitochondrial genes commonly referred to as ``barcode{''} regions. However, unlike the typical structure of an animal mitochondrial genome, those for the invasive zebra and quagga mussels are greatly expanded with large extended tandem repeat regions. These sections of repeated DNA can appear hundreds of times within the genome compared to a single copy for the mitochondrial barcode genes. This higher number of target copies per mitochondrial genome presents an opportunity to increase eDNA assay sensitivity for these species. Therefore, we designed and evaluated new eDNA assays to target the extended repeat sections for both zebra and quagga mussels. These assays lower the limit of detection of genomic DNA by 100-fold for zebra mussels and 10-fold for quagga mussels. Additionally, these newly developed assays provided longer durations of detection during degradation mesocosm experiments and greater sensitivity for eDNA detection from water samples collected across western Lake Erie compared to standard assays targeting mitochondrial genes. This work illustrates how understanding the complete genomic structure of an organism can improve eDNA analysis.},

The present study quantified the concentrations of chlorophyll-a in the water column of the Miranda River Basin, located in western Brazil, contributing to form the Pantanal Wetland, and attempted to identify the primary environmental influences on the phytoplankton biomass. Methods: Temperature, depth, current speed, turbidity, Secchi transparency and concentrations of nutrients, suspended solids and chlorophyll-a were measured at approximate monthly intervals during the course of a year, at five upland and three lowland sites. Relationships between chlorophyll-a and nutrient concentrations, travel times and light availability were examined. Results: Nutrient levels were generally low, being oligo- to mesotrophic. High levels of suspended solids were recorded (up to approximately 250 mg.L-1), especially in the rainy season at the upland sites. The latter showed low chlorophyll-a concentrations, while lowland sites, with the exception of one, showed two peaks, one in winter (dry season) and the other in summer (wet season), of 4.9 and 2.4qg.L-1, respectively, coincident with reduced concentrations of suspended solids. Conclusions: The low nutrient levels recorded may have been due to the main land use being cattle rearing. The high solids concentrations found may have been due to the degradation of native vegetation, especially riparian, that has occurred over the past decades. Travel times of approximately three to four days may have been a factor in retarding algal abundance in the upland sites, as opposed to approximately ten days in the lowland sites, where light limitation may have been a factor reducing algal growth.},

abstract={Antifoulant paints were developed to prevent and reduce biofouling on surfaces immersed in seawater. The widespread use of these substances over the years has led to a significant increase of their presence in the marine environment. These compounds were identified as environmental and human threats. As a result of an international ban, research in the last decade has focused on developing a new generation of benign antifoulant paints. This review outlines the detrimental effects associated with biocide versus eco-friendly antifoulants, highlighting what are effective antifoulants and why there is a need to monitor them. We examine the effects of biocide and eco-friendly antifoulants on the antioxidative defence mechanism and settlement in a higher sessile organism, specifically the Mediterranean mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis. These antifoulants can indirectly assess the potential of these two parameters in order to outline implementation of sustainable antifoulants.},

title={Environmental Viability Analysis of Connected European Inlandâ€“Marine Waterways and Their Services in View of Climate Change},
abstract={Inland waterways and their connections to marine transport systems constitute a substantial resource for the establishment of green infrastructures, flood prevention, and environmental conservation. However, these developments have numerous inherent environmental hazards such as water and air pollution, a loss of habitats, increased coastal erosion, the transfer of invasive species between connected watercourses and lakes, and the transport of pollutants through watercourses to coastal areas. Climate change may aggravate these environmental problems through changing temperatures, reduced precipitation, enhancing the adverse impact of excess nutrient discharge, and the entry of invasive species. In this study, we analyse the main European inland waterway corridors and their branches to assess the ecological viability of a pan-European inland waterway network. The environmental viability of such network depends on the right assessment of ecosystem services and protection of biodiversity. A model structure for landscape conservation, green infrastructure development, water replenishment, and ecosystem reconstruction is proposed, considering a sustainable combination of multimodal inland waterway and rail transport.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to determine whether endemic coral fish commonly consumed by Jeddah residents could serve as bioindicators of oil contamination. In addition, we planned to investigate the relationship between amino acid changes and hydrocarbon concentrations in fish tissue. The composition of amino acids was analyzed using high-pressure liquid chromatography with precolumn derivatization. An analytical study of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and total petroleum hydrocarbons was conducted by combining gas chromatography with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Multivariate statistical analysis was applied using Statgraphics software to determine the impact of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and total petroleum hydrocarbons on the amino acid profile of three species of fish. In addition, the bioconcentration factor was estimated in the studied species and was used to validate the results obtained from the multivariate analysis. Based on the results of the study, the sum of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with two cycles, and with five to six cycles, is in reverse order in Plectropomus pessuliferus with respect to Epinephelus tauvina and Cephalopholis argus. The factor analysis showed high factor scores for aspartic acid, glutamic acid, tyrosine, chrysene, and total petroleum hydrocarbons, and for lipids and benzo(g,h,i)perylene, which could be explained by bioaccumulation. It was concluded that the high proportions of glutamic acid (8.32<e2><80><93>11.10%) and aspartic acid (6.06<e2><80><93>8.27%) in the muscles of the studied species are a sign of contamination with petroleum hydrocarbons. The incremental lifetime cancer risk values for the three endemic fish exceeded the limit value (>10<e2><88><92>5), indicating a high potential cancer risk for the Saudi population.},

Methods: Zooplankton samples were collected from sites located in an oxbow lake and the Apor<c3><a9> River bed during the rainy and dry seasons. We collected these samples from the surface and bottom levels of two different zones (littoral and channel). For each hydrological season, analysis of variance was conducted to determine the differences in species richness and abundance of zooplankton among different sites (longitudinal), zones (lateral), and depths (vertical). Cluster analysis was performed to assess the similarity in species composition. In addition, a canonical correspondence analysis was used to select the environmental variables that best explained the variation in zooplankton abundance data. Results: We recorded 152 species: 70 rotifers, 53 testate amoebae, 20 cladocerans, and 9 copepods. We observed changes in the species richness and abundance of zooplankton along the longitudinal axis of the river in both the rainy and dry seasons. However, we did not detect any lateral or vertical changes in these attributes. Cluster analysis also indicated that the greatest differences in species composition were in the longitudinal axis of the river. The longitudinal variability of zooplankton was mainly associated with the influence of an upstream oxbow lake, as well as the changes in water flow velocity, turbidity, and concentrations of suspended solids downstream. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the importance of a heterogeneity of hydrological characteristics as a structuring factor of the zooplankton community in the Apor<c3><a9> River. Thus, we highlight the relevance of actions to protect and maintain the natural characteristics of these environments.},

title={Linking Micropollutants to Trait Syndromes across Freshwater Diatom, Macroinvertebrate, and Fish Assemblages},
abstract={The ecological quality of freshwater ecosystems is endangered by various micropollutants released into the environment by human activities. The cumulative effects of these micropollutants can affect the fitness of organisms and populations and the functional diversity of stream ecosystems. In this study, we investigated the relationships between the joint toxicity of micropollutants and trait syndromes. A trait syndrome corresponds to a combination of traits that could occur together in communities due to the trait selection driven by exposure to these micropollutants. Our objectives were to (i) identify trait syndromes specific to diatom, macroinvertebrate, and fish assemblages and their responses to exposure, taking into account four micropollutant types (mineral micropollutants, pesticides, PAHs, and other organic micropollutants) and nine modes of action (only for pesticides), (ii) explore how these syndromes vary within and among the three biological compartments, (iii) investigate the trait categories driving the responses of syndromes to micropollutant exposure, and (iv) identify specific taxa, so-called paragons, which are highly representative of these syndromes. To achieve these objectives, we analyzed a dataset including the biological and physico-chemical results of 2007 sampling events from a large-scale monitoring survey routinely performed in French wadeable streams. We have identified five (diatoms), eight (macroinvertebrates), and eight (fishes) trait syndromes, either positively or negatively related to an increasing toxicity gradient of different clusters of micropollutant types or modes of action. Our analyses identified several key trait categories and sets of paragons, exhibiting good potential for highlighting exposure by specific micropollutant types and modes of action. Overall, trait syndromes might represent a novel and integrative bioassessment tool, driven by the diversity of trait-based responses to increasing gradients of micropollutant toxic cocktails.},

abstract={Mussels have been used as animal models for studying ecotoxicology, biomineralization, and bio-adhesion for many years. Despite a wealth of studies on their shell matrix and byssus proteins, few studies have focused on the extracellular matrix molecules in mussel soft tissues. Extracellular matrix molecules may play important roles in biomineralization, immune reaction, and tissue homeostasis. In the present study, extracellular matrix and mineralization-related molecules in zebra mussel soft tissue were immunolocalized using well-characterized monoclonal antibodies. Our results demonstrate specific immunolocalization for collagen IV, fibronectin, and keratan sulfate in hemocytes; collagen IV in peripheral nerves; and aggrecan, link protein, and collagen XVIII in foot tissue. Laminin, decorin, and osteonectin were also broadly immunolocalized in mussel soft tissues. The distributions of these extracellular matrix molecules in mussel tissues are in line with the cell-mediated shell mineralization hypothesis, providing evidence for the molecules involved in the peripheral nervous system and byssus formation, and explaining the conservation of extracellular matrix molecules during evolution. These results further contribute to establishing zebra mussels as an attractive animal model in biomedical research.},

All items in diets were separated and enumerated, and all fish-like diet items were genetically identified to confirm species-level ID.

Adult silver carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix (age 3<e2><80><93>5, mean = 3.9 years, SE = 0.2; n = 21) had the highest frequency of occurrence (70%) and constituted the greatest percentage by number (58%) and weight (60%) in/of blue catfish diets.

title={Global climate change and the Baltic Sea ecosystem: direct and indirect effects on species, communities and ecosystem functioning},
abstract={Climate change has multiple effects on Baltic Sea species, communities and ecosystem functioning through changes in physical and biogeochemical environmental characteristics of the sea. Associated indirect and secondary effects on species interactions, trophic dynamics and ecosystem function are expected to be significant. We review studies investigating species-, population- and ecosystem-level effects of abiotic factors that may change due to global climate change, such as temperature, salinity, oxygen, pH, nutrient levels, and the more indirect biogeochemical and food web processes, primarily based on peer-reviewed literature published since 2010.For phytoplankton, clear symptoms of climate change, such as prolongation of the growing season, are evident and can be explained by the warming, but otherwise climate effects vary from species to species and area to area. Several modelling studies project a decrease of phytoplankton bloom in spring and an increase in cyanobacteria blooms in summer. The associated increase in N:P ratio may contribute to maintaining the â€œvicious circle of eutrophicationâ€. However, uncertainties remain because some field studies claim that cyanobacteria have not increased and some experimental studies show that responses of cyanobacteria to temperature, salinity and pH vary from species to species. An increase of riverine dissolved organic matter (DOM) may also decrease primary production, but the relative importance of this process in different sea areas is not well known. Bacteria growth is favoured by increasing temperature and DOM, but complex effects in the microbial food web are probable. Warming of seawater in spring also speeds up zooplankton growth and shortens the time lag between phytoplankton and zooplankton peaks, which may lead to decreasing of phytoplankton in spring. In summer, a shift towards smaller-sized zooplankton and a decline of marine copepod species has been projected.In deep benthic communities, continued eutrophication promotes high sedimentation and maintains good food conditions for zoobenthos. If nutrient abatement proceeds, improving oxygen conditions will first increase zoobenthos biomass, but the subsequent decrease of sedimenting matter will disrupt the pelagicâ€“benthic coupling and lead to a decreased zoobenthos biomass. In the shallower photic systems, heatwaves may produce eutrophication-like effects, e.g. overgrowth of bladderwrack by epiphytes, due to a trophic cascade. If salinity also declines, marine species such as bladderwrack, eelgrass and blue mussel may decline. Freshwater vascular plants will be favoured but they cannot replace macroalgae on rocky substrates. Consequently invertebrates and fish benefiting from macroalgal belts may also suffer. Climate-induced changes in the environment also favour establishment of non-indigenous species, potentially affecting food web dynamics in the Baltic Sea.As for fish, salinity decline and continuing of hypoxia is projected to keep cod stocks low, whereas the increasing temperature has been projected to favour sprat and certain coastal fish. Regime shifts and cascading effects have been observed in both pelagic and benthic systems as a result of several climatic and environmental effects acting synergistically.Knowledge gaps include uncertainties in projecting the future salinity level, as well as stratification and potential rate of internal loading, under different climate forcings. This weakens our ability to project how pelagic productivity, fish populations and macroalgal communities may change in the future. The 3D ecosystem models, food web models and 2D species distribution models would benefit from integration, but progress is slowed down by scale problems and inability of models to consider the complex interactions between species. Experimental work should be better integrated into empirical and modelling studies of food web dynamics to get a more comprehensive view of the responses of the pelagic and benthic systems to climate change, from bacteria to fish. In addition, to better understand the effects of climate change on the biodiversity of the Baltic Sea, more emphasis should be placed on studies of shallow photic environments.The fate of the Baltic Sea ecosystem will depend on various intertwined environmental factors and on development of the society. Climate change will probably delay the effects of nutrient abatement and tend to keep the ecosystem in its â€œnovelâ€ state. However, several modelling studies conclude that nutrient reductions will be a stronger driver for ecosystem functioning of the Baltic Sea than climate change. Such studies highlight the importance of studying the Baltic Sea as an interlinked socio-ecological system.},

title={Assessing the Variances of Citizen Stakeholder Justice in Watershed Governance: Is Action More Effective with Reactive or Proactive Administrations},
abstract={Watershed governance has historically been administered by natural resource experts and is often inaccessible to citizen stakeholders. Although many advocate for deliberative democracy as a pathway toward natural resource sustainability, others remain skeptical due to perceived tradeoffs. Environmental deliberative democracy (EDD) serves as a conceptual synthesis of collaborative principles. This research compares the social, economic, and political discourses in two Wisconsin watersheds (Geneva Lake in regulatory compliance and Green Lake, which is deemed state impaired) and posits that EDD community compatibility is enhanced by public trust in expert capacity and accessible watershed education resources. A mixed methodology is used to analyze quantitative data from citizen surveys and qualitative interview responses. Findings affirm that proactive watershed management frameworks are stronger when not prompted by environmental crises. Management programs created reactively with a specific agenda have a comparable structure with citizen involvement but have a limited capacity, scope, and potential for sustained success.},

title={Climate change in the Baltic Sea region: a summary},
abstract={Based on the Baltic Earth Assessment Reports of this thematic issue in Earth System Dynamics and recent peer-reviewed literature, current knowledge of the effects of global warming on past and future changes in climate of the Baltic Sea region is summarised and assessed. The study is an update of the Second Assessment of Climate Change (BACC II) published in 2015 and focuses on the atmosphere, land, cryosphere, ocean, sediments, and the terrestrial and marine biosphere. Based on the summaries of the recent knowledge gained in palaeo-, historical, and future regional climate research, we find that the main conclusions from earlier assessments still remain valid. However, new long-term, homogenous observational records, for example, for Scandinavian glacier inventories, sea-level-driven saltwater inflows, so-called Major Baltic Inflows, and phytoplankton species distribution, and new scenario simulations with improved models, for example, for glaciers, lake ice, and marine food web, have become available. In many cases, uncertainties can now be better estimated than before because more models were included in the ensembles, especially for the Baltic Sea. With the help of coupled models, feedbacks between several components of the Earth system have been studied, and multiple driver studies were performed, e.g. projections of the food web that include fisheries, eutrophication, and climate change. New datasets and projections have led to a revised understanding of changes in some variables such as salinity. Furthermore, it has become evident that natural variability, in particular for the ocean on multidecadal timescales, is greater than previously estimated, challenging our ability to detect observed and projected changes in climate. In this context, the first palaeoclimate simulations regionalised for the Baltic Sea region are instructive. Hence, estimated uncertainties for the projections of many variables increased. In addition to the well-known influence of the North Atlantic Oscillation, it was found that also other low-frequency modes of internal variability, such as the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability, have profound effects on the climate of the Baltic Sea region. Challenges were also identified, such as the systematic discrepancy between future cloudiness trends in global and regional models and the difficulty of confidently attributing large observed changes in marine ecosystems to climate change. Finally, we compare our results with other coastal sea assessments, such as the North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment (NOSCCA), and find that the effects of climate change on the Baltic Sea differ from those on the North Sea, since Baltic Sea oceanography and ecosystems are very different from other coastal seas such as the North Sea. While the North Sea dynamics are dominated by tides, the Baltic Sea is characterised by brackish water, a perennial vertical stratification in the southern subbasins, and a seasonal sea ice cover in the northern subbasins.},

Field studies of alien terrestrial gastropods Xeropicta derbentina (Gastropoda, Stylommatophora, Hygromiidae), Brephulopsis cylindrica (Gastropoda, Stylommatophora, Enidae) and Harmozica ravergiensis (Gastropoda, Stylommatophora, Hygromiidae) have been carried out in Belgorod city, the southern part of the Central Russian Upland (Russia). All studied species are native to the Black Sea region and the Caucasus; in the southern part of the Central Russian Upland, they have been registered over the past ten years. The population density, demographic structure, and spatial structure have been analyzed for three years of observations (2017, 2019, 2020). During this period, the changes in the population density have been noted for all studied species. The most pronounced changes have been observed in X. derbentina, whose population density has significantly decreased, and the spatial structure has changed from clustered type to random distribution. In addition, the age structure of X. derbentina population had a pronounced change at the beginning of the snail activity season of 2020. The expansion of the other two invaders, B. cylindrica and H. ravergiensis, is proved as more successful. At the same time, H. ravergiensis is distributed throughout the city. This species has stable population density and random type of spatial population structure on most sites. B. cylindrica has the highest population density: in 2020, it has reached 406 ind./m2 on average, with the maximum of 1215 ind./m2. Meantime, the species keeps the clustered spatial structure, which is explained by both high population density and adaptation to the arid conditions of its natural range.},

title={Land Use Change to Reduce Freshwater Nitrogen and Phosphorus will Be Effective Even with Projected Climate Change},
abstract={Recent studies have demonstrated that projected climate change will likely enhance nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) loss from farms and farmland, with the potential to worsen freshwater eutrophication. Here, we investigate the relative importance of the climate and land use drivers of nutrient loss in nine study catchments in Europe and a neighboring country (Turkey), ranging in area from 50 to 12,000 km2. The aim was to quantify whether planned large-scale, land use change aimed at N and P loss reduction would be effective given projected climate change. To this end, catchment-scale biophysical models were applied within a common framework to quantify the integrated effects of projected changes in climate, land use (including wastewater inputs), N deposition, and water use on river and lake water quantity and quality for the mid-21st century. The proposed land use changes were derived from catchment stakeholder workshops, and the assessment quantified changes in mean annual N and P concentrations and loads. At most of the sites, the projected effects of climate change alone on nutrient concentrations and loads were small, whilst land use changes had a larger effect and were of sufficient magnitude that, overall, a move to more environmentally focused farming achieved a reduction in N and P concentrations and loads despite projected climate change. However, at Bey<c5><9f>ehir lake in Turkey, increased temperatures and lower precipitation reduced water flows considerably, making climate change, rather than more intensive nutrient usage, the greatest threat to the freshwater ecosystem. Individual site responses did however vary and were dependent on the balance of diffuse and point source inputs. Simulated lake chlorophyll-a changes were not generally proportional to changes in nutrient loading. Further work is required to accurately simulate the flow and water quality extremes and determine how reductions in freshwater N and P translate into an aquatic ecosystem response.},

Analysis of <ce><b4> 15N and <ce><b4>13C stable isotopes was carried out to trace how taxa with different trophic levels and carbon sources contributed to mercury concentrations and trends. THg ranged between 44<e2><80><93>213 <c2><b5>g kg<e2><88><92>1 d.w. and MeHg 15<e2><80><93>93 <c2><b5>g kg<e2><88><92>1 d.w., representing 24<e2><80><93>61% of THg. Values showed strong seasonal variations, with peaks in winter, due to the high biomass of predator taxa (Bythotrephes longimanus, Leptodora kindtii) and of Daphnia longispina-galeata gr. A positive correlation between THg and MeHg and <ce><b4>15N signature was observed. D. longispina-galeata gr. prevailed in both size fractions, substantially contributing to THg and MeHg concentrations. <ce><94>13C signature was strictly bound to lake thermal circulation dynamics. Mercury stock in the zooplankton compartment ranged between 19<e2><80><93>140 ng THg m<e2><88><92>2 and 6<e2><80><93>44 ng MeHg m<e2><88><92>2 for the <e2><89><a5>450 <c2><b5>m size fraction and between 2<e2><80><93>66 ng THg m<e2><88><92>2 and 1<e2><80><93>7 ng MeHg m<e2><88><92>2 for the <e2><89><a5>850 <c2><b5>m fraction, with the highest values in spring when zooplanktivorous fish actively prey in the pelagic zone. The results highlighted the crucial role of zooplankton as a repository of mercury, easily available to higher trophic levels.},

title={Evaluating Multiple Stressor Effects on Benthicâ€“Pelagic Freshwater Communities in Systems of Different Complexities: Challenges in Upscaling},
abstract={Upscaling of ecological effects from indoor microcosms to outdoor mesocosms bridging the gap between controlled laboratory conditions and highly complex natural environments poses several challenges: typical standard water types used in laboratory experiments are not feasible in large outdoor experiments. Additionally, moving from the micro- to meso-scale, biodiversity is enhanced. We performed an indoor microcosm experiment to determine the effects of agricultural run-off (ARO) on a defined benthicâ€“pelagic community comprising primary producers and primary consumers, exposed to ambient summer temperature and +3.5 Â°C. Treatments were replicated in two water types (standard Volvic and Munich well water). We then scaled up to outdoor mesocosms using an ARO concentration gradient and +3 Â°C warming above ambient temperature, using Munich well water. We included the same benthic macroorganisms but more complex periphyton and plankton communities. All the functional groups were affected by stressors in the microcosms, and a shift from macrophyte to phytoplankton dominance was observed. While effects were present, they were less pronounced in the mesocosms, where a higher biodiversity may have modified the responses of the system to the stressors. The stressor effects observed in controlled experiments may thus be masked in more complex outdoor experiments, but should not be interpreted as â€œno effectsâ€.},

title={Sudden Changes in Water Hardness Do Not Impact Short-Term Rainbow Trout Survival},
abstract={Fish transferred from hard water to soft water, as can occur during the stocking of hatchery-reared fish into natural environments, experience many physiological stressors that can cause mortality. This study consisted of four trials examining the effects of direct transfer from hard (345 mg/L CaCO3) to soft water on mortality and glucose stress response of two different sizes and strains of rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss. The first trial subjected 90 g Shasta strain rainbow trout to a direct transfer to soft water (70 or 160 mg/L as CaCO3). The second trial used the same strain and size trout, with transfer to lower hardness values of either 0 or 35 mg/L. The third and fourth trials used 3 to 5 g Arlee strain rainbow trout. The third trial transferred the fish from 345 mg/L hardness water to water at a hardness of either 0 or 35 mg/L. The fourth trial added a secondary temperature stressor of 20 <c2><b0>C (versus the experimental standard of 11 <c2><b0>C) in combination with a hardness level of 0 mg/L. In every trial, survival was not significantly different among all treatments. Sudden and extreme changes in water hardness, even in combination with increased water temperature, did not cause trout mortality. There was also no significant difference in blood glucose over time among any of the treatments in the first three trials. In the fourth trial, glucose values did significantly vary among the treatments at 48 and 168 h after the start of the trial. However, all glucose values were relatively close to the basal level. These results indicate that changes in water hardness likely do not impact the survival of rainbow trout, negating the need for tempering or acclimation.},

title={Towards Risk Assessments of Microplastics in Bivalve Mollusks Globally},
abstract={The ubiquitous presence of microplastics in bivalve mollusks and related risks have raised particular concerns. In this study, the available data on the abundance and polymer type of microplastics in bivalves from twenty-two countries were extracted to comprehensively understand the risks of microplastics in bivalves. Following the data from 52 peer-reviewed papers, the abundance, chemical composition, and human exposure risks of microplastics of bivalves among countries were initially assessed. Abundance risk results indicated that bivalves from 22 countries presented a low pollution load index, showing a lower risk level (level I). The polymer risk index (H) of bivalves from Portugal (Hcountry = 1335, level IV) and India (Hcountry = 1187, level IV) were higher than the other countries due to the occurrence of hazardous microplastics, such as polyvinyl chloride. For the human exposure risks, the global mean value of microplastic exposure to humans via mollusk consumption is estimated to be 751 microplastics/capita/year, with the maximum intake by the Chinese. This study suggests that abundance risk may be a fundamental indicator for assessing the potential hazard to humans until the chemical composition risks are confirmed. This study is the first attempt to assess the potential risks of microplastics in bivalves using three evaluation models based on microplastic abundances and polymer types, which will contribute to establishing future human health risk assessment frameworks. These findings will also assist efforts in policy-making to minimize microplastic risks in seafood.},

abstract={Surveys and assessments based on environmental DNA are not only efficient and time-saving, but also cause less harm to monitoring targets. Environmental DNA has become a common tool for the assessment and monitoring of aquatic organisms. In this study, we investigated fish resources in the Yangtze River mainstream using environmental DNA, and the variations in fish during two seasons (spring and autumn) were compared. The results showed that 13 species were identified in spring, and nine species of fish were identified in autumn. The fish with higher eDNA detection were Sinibotia superciliaris, Tachysurus fulvidraco, Cyprinus carpio, Ctenopharyngodon Idella, Monopterus albus, Acanthogobius hasta, Saurogobio dabryi, Oncorhynchus mykiss, Mugil cephalus, Odontamblyopus rubicundus. Seasonal variation between spring and autumn was not significant, and the environmental factors had different effects on fish assemblages during the two seasons. Our study used the eDNA technique to monitor the composition of fish in the spring and autumn in the Yangtze River mainstream, providing a new technology for the long-term management and protection of fishery resources in the region. Of course, problems such as pollution and insufficient databases are the current shortcomings of environmental DNA, which will be the focus of our future research and study.},

title={An automatic lake-model application using near-real-time data forcing: development of an operational forecast workflow (COASTLINES) for Lake Erie},
abstract={For enhanced public safety and water resource management, a three-dimensional operational lake hydrodynamic forecasting system, COASTLINES (Canadian cOASTal and Lake forecastINg modEl System), was developed. The modeling system is built upon the three-dimensional Aquatic Ecosystem Model (AEM3D) model, with predictive simulation capabilities developed and tested for a large lake (i.e., Lake Erie). The open-access workflow derives model forcing, code execution, post-processing, and web-based visualization of the model outputs, including water level elevations and temperatures, in near-real time. COASTLINES also generates 240 h predictions using atmospheric forcing from 15 and 25 km horizontal-resolution operational meteorological products from the Environment Canada Global Deterministic Forecast System (GDPS). Simulated water levels were validated against observations from six gauge stations, with model error increasing with forecast horizon. Satellite images and lake buoys were used to validate forecast lake surface temperature and the water column thermal stratification. The forecast lake surface temperature is as accurate as hindcasts, with a root-mean-square deviation <2 <e2><88><98>C.

title={Advances in the Fate of Rare Earth Elements, REE, in Transitional Environments: Coasts and Estuaries},
abstract={The production of rare earth elements, REE, has significantly increased over the past years, in parallel with the latest advances in nanotechnologies and representing a new group of emerging contaminants. They find application in construction, transport, agriculture, electronics, catalysis, and biomedicine. Their extraordinary intrinsic characteristics are fundamental for overcoming current technological challenges. The accumulation of REE is consistent in near-shore waters being affected by runoff, wastewater discharge, and proximity to built-up areas. Bioavailability in water, sediments, and accumulation in marine biota as well their endocrine disruptor effect is mostly unknown. There is a significant gap of knowledge on the ecotoxicological behaviour of REE in marine areas. The existing investigations have been performed inside well-mixed estuarine systems, due to complex hydrodynamics and multiple sediment transport situations. This hampers the definition of regulatory thresholds for REE concentrations and emissions. The review summarizes the existing information on REE geochemistry and physicochemical conditions influencing dissolution, surface complexation reactions, and distribution at the continent<e2><80><93>ocean interface, as well as their speciation, bioavailability, and detrimental effects on living organisms. Strategies for reducing REE usage and inputs are also discussed.},

title={Spatio-temporal variation in stable isotope and elemental composition of key-species reflect environmental changes in the Baltic Sea},
abstract={Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios are increasingly used to study long-term change in food web structure and nutrient cycling. We retrospectively analyse elemental composition (C, N and P) and stable isotopes (<ce><b4>13C, <ce><b4>15N) in archived monitoring samples of two important taxa from the bottom of the food web; the filamentous ephemeral macroalgae Cladophora spp. and the blue mussel Mytilus edulis trossulus from three contrasting regions in the Baltic Sea (coastal Bothnian Sea and Baltic Proper, open sea central Baltic). The aim is to statistically link the observed spatial and interannual (8<e2><80><93>24 years<e2><80><99> time-series) variability in elemental and isotope baselines with their biomass trends and to the oceanographic monitoring data reflecting the ongoing environmental changes (i.e., eutrophication and climate) in this system. We find clear differences in isotope baselines between the two major Baltic Sea basins. However, the temporal variation in Mytilus <ce><b4>13C was similar among regions and, at the open sea station, mussels and algae <ce><b4>13C also correlated over time, likely reflecting a global (Suess) effect, whereas <ce><b4>15N of both taxa varied with local and regional dissolved nitrogen concentrations in water. <ce><b4>15N in source amino acids allowed detection of diazotrophic N in Mytilus, which was masked in bulk <ce><b4>15N. Finally, Cladophora N:P reflected regional nutrient levels in the water while P%, which differed for both taxa, was linked to food quality for Mytilus. This study highlights the potential of a multi-taxa and multi-stable isotope approach to understand nutrient dynamics and monitor long-term environmental changes.},

title={Partitioning benthic nitrogen cycle processes among three common macrofauna holobionts},
abstract={The effects of single macrofauna taxa on benthic nitrogen (N) cycling have been extensively studied, whereas how macrofaunal communities affect N-related processes remains poorly explored. In this study, we characterized benthic N-cycling in bioturbated sediments of the oligotrophic <c3><96>re Estuary (northern Baltic Sea). Solute fluxes and N transformations (N2 fixation, denitrification and dissimilative nitrate reduction to ammonium [DNRA]) were measured in sediments and macrofauna-associated microbes (holobionts) to partition the role of three dominant taxa (the filter feeder Limecola balthica, the deep deposit feeder Marenzelleria spp., and the surface deposit feeder Monoporeia affinis) in shaping N-cycling. In the studied area, benthic macrofauna comprised a low diversity community with dominance of the three taxa, which are widespread and dominant in the Baltic. The biomass of these taxa in macrofaunal community explained up to 30% of variation in measured biogeochemical processes, confirming their important role in ecosystem functioning. The results also show that these taxa significantly contributed to the benthic metabolism and N-cycling (direct effect) as well as to sediments bioturbation with positive feedback to dissimilative nitrate reduction (indirect effect). Taken together, these functions promoted a reuse of nutrients at the benthic level, limiting net losses (e.g. denitrification) and effluxes to bottom water. Finally, the detection of multiple N transformations in macrofauna holobionts suggested a community-associated versatile microbiome, however, its role was of minor importance as compared to the activity of sediment-associated microbial communities. The present study highlights hidden and interactive effects among microbes and macrofauna, which should be considered analysing benthic functioning.},

In adults, exposure to the pesticide did not lead to changes in free swimming parameters. However, a marked decrease of swimming endurance was observed at all experimental treatments, although probably not in consequence of energetic depletion, since baseline blood glucose levels and condition factor were similar at all conditions. Furthermore, zebrafish adults did not show their natural preference for the dark environment. The pesticide likely has anxiolytic effects on zebrafish, as well as a compromising effect on locomotor control, illustrating that behavioural changes, which could affect activities on the natural environment, such as escape and predation, may occur even in environmentally relevant concentrations of this pollutant.},

title={Current aspects of DNA damage and repair in ecotoxicology: a mini-review},
abstract={The preservation of genomic stability against environmental stressors is a major adaptive feature that is well-conserved among both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The complex and fine-tuned mechanisms that evolved to repair DNA following exposure to radiation and chemical insult are also the first line of defence against genotoxicants. Consequently, impairing the DNA damage response leads to accumulation of genomic lesions that may ultimately lead to cell death, mutagenesis and even teratogenesis and neoplasia. Understanding how pollutants affect DNA repair machinery is thus paramount to interpret the often unclear or contradictory findings from genotoxicity assessment. The main purpose of the present mini-review is to contribute to the slowly-growing awareness among ecotoxicologists that DNA damage is not limited to direct interactions of noxious compounds with the DNA molecule. Despite the limited number of studies addressing this issue in the field, special modifications of methods for genotoxicity assessment, combined with state-of-the-art molecular tools, are beginning to show promising results in the unravelling of DNA repair proteins, genes and networks in non-conventional model organisms. I will review the essentials of the most important DNA repair pathways and discuss methods and approaches that can assist steering ecotoxicologists towards a better understanding of genotoxic hazard and risk.},

title={Factors associated with the population structure of an invasive mollusk in a neotropical floodplain},
abstract={Limnoperna fortunei is an invasive mussel species that is continuously expanding through South American. It has five larval stages, which usually differ in tolerance to environmental factors. How different abiotic filters affect L. fortunei larval stages has not been studied in depth. We employed a detailed database describing five floodplain environments to investigate the distribution of L. fortunei larval stages within and among these environments and determine which local abiotic filters affect the density of each larval stage. We found that the two youngest larval stages accounted for up to 83% of the larval density in four of the five environments studied, confirming an expanding population pyramid of L. fortunei in these environments. We also found positive and negative relationships among abiotic filters, and these relationships affected, directly and indirectly, the density of the youngest larval stages. Turbidity, water level, and suspended inorganic matter directly decreased the density of the two youngest larval stages. Conversely, temperature and pH directly increased the density of D-shaped and umbonated stages, respectively. Additionally, water level indirectly increased the density of the youngest larval stages mediated by declines in turbidity and suspended inorganic matter. Our findings suggest a likely expansion of L. fortunei in the Upper Paran<c3><a1> Floodplain. However, local abiotic filters, such as turbidity, water level, and suspended inorganic matter, decrease the density of the youngest larval stages. This finding illustrates that the establishment of L. fortunei can be prevented mainly if the youngest larval stages are controlled.},

title={Evaluating Connections Between Nitrogen Cycling and the Macrofauna in Native Oyster Beds in a New England Estuary},
abstract={Recent efforts to quantify biogeochemical and ecological processes in oyster habitats have focused on provision of habitat and regulation of the nitrogen cycle. However, it is unclear how these two processes may interact. In this study, seasonal patterns of habitat use and nitrogen removal from natural oyster beds were quantified for comparison with nearby bare sediment in Green Hill Pond, a temperate coastal lagoon in RI, USA. Relationships were tested between benthic macrofaunal abundance and nitrogen removal via denitrification and burial in sediments. Nitrogen removal by oyster bio-assimilation was quantified and compared with nearby oyster aquaculture. Despite limited differences in habitat use by macrofauna, there were fewer non-oyster benthic organisms (e.g., filter-feeders, detritivores) where oysters were present, possibly due to competition for resources. Additionally, low rugosity of the native oyster beds provided little refuge value for prey. There was a shift from net N removal via denitrification in bare sediments to nitrogen fixation beneath oysters, though this change was not statistically significant (t(96) = 1.201; p = 0.233). Sediments contained low concentrations of N; however sediments beneath oysters contained almost twice as much N (0.07%) as bare sediments (0.04%; p < 0.001). There was no difference in tissue N content between wild oysters and those raised in aquaculture nearby, though caged oysters had more tissue per shell mass and length, and therefore removed more N on a shell length basis. These oyster beds lacked the complex structure of three-dimensional oyster reefs which may have diminished their ability to provide habitat for refugia, foraging sites for macrofauna, and conditions known to stimulate denitrification.},

title={Indonesian freshwater bivalves: a meta-analysis of endemicity, ecoregion distributions, and conservation status},
abstract={Biological information on Indonesian freshwater bivalves is scattered across publications. Thus, to assemble comprehensive data on their diversity, origin, ecoregion distributions, and conservation status, we conducted a meta-analysis of data from 521 scientific references published between 1838 and early 2021. A total of 57 valid species of 119 freshwater bivalves were documented in the reference sources, reflecting 4.8% of the world's freshwater bivalve species, with 29 (50.9%) being endemic species. Lake Toba, Singkarak, Poso, Malili system river, Sentani, river of Indragiri, Kapuas, Digul and Merauke are the endemicity hotspots of freshwater bivalve in Indonesia. The geographic distribution of species diversity is discussed both in terms of bivalve characteristics and ancient rivers analysis, so it is made that Indonesian's freshwater bivalves were distributed across three ecoregions: 1) Sundaland, comprising the main islands of Sumatra, Java, and Kalimantan (part of Borneo), dominated by the Unionidae; 2) Wallacea, which comprises Sulawesi only, dominated by the Cyrenidae; and 3) the Sahul region, which comprises only Papua and is a hotspot of the Hyriidae. Unfortunately, 43 (75.4%) of the species recorded were not listed in the IUCN directory, and only 12 (21.1%) were recognized by the Indonesian government as protected species. Research on freshwater bivalve species diversity and conservation actions are urgently warranted; neglect of this ecologically and economically important group could cause species declines, more species being categorized as historical species, and, at worst, the unexpected extinction of species. In addition, adequate funding, solid research teams, research continuity, and inter-institutional solid collaboration are needed to strengthen the conservation of freshwater bivalve diversity in Indonesia.},

abstract={The aim of this review was to identify the current knowledge regarding the concentration of microplastics in bivalves in the marine, estuarine, and freshwater environments. For this purpose, researches were conducted from September 2020 to February 2021 in the Scopus, Web of Science, and Google scholar databases, following a meticulous selection of articles. To comprehensively understand the selected articles, an extensive review was carried out in order to identify the methodologies employed, sampling sites, species evaluated, characteristics of the microplastics (concentrations, shapes, sizes, and polymers) and their relationship with the concentration of this particles in the environment. A total of 93 articles were selected, with an exponential growth in the number of articles from April 2014 to February 2021. Worldwide, 80 articles were realized in the Northern Hemisphere and thirteen in the Southern Hemisphere. The samplings of organisms were carried out in 36 countries, besides one in Antarctica. The concentration of microplastics were studied in 70 species, with mussels Mytilus spp. and the oysters Crassostrea spp. being the main genus studied. Due to the different methodologies used to digest the tissues of organisms and identify microplastics and species, it is difficult to make comparisons between the results of different studies. In addition, data on the concentrations of microplastics in the environment, as well as their composition and characteristics, are needed, enabling the verification of relationships with the concentrations identified in organisms, which does not occur in most studies. Thus, we suggest an increase in the number of studies to be realized in the southern hemisphere, future studies use the same methodology of digestion, the polymer identification of microplastics and samplings of the surrounding environment, enabling a greater comparison between studies.},

Significant positive correlation was identified by the Spearman<e2><80><99>s rank correlation test between total PAH concentration and percent impervious surface. The findings support the paradigm that PAHs are primarily derived from land-based sources. Offshore and riverine locations had the lowest and highest median total PAH concentrations, respectively.

In this study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) were used as an in vivo model to investigate the potential risks and molecular mechanisms of the toxic effects of polyethylene MPs (45<e2><80><93>53<e2><80><89><ce><bc>m). In the zebrafish intestine, 6, 5, and 186 genes showed differential expression after MP treatment for 1, 5, and 10 days, respectively. In the gills, 318, 92, and 484 genes showed differential expression after MP treatment for 1, 5, and 10 days, respectively. In both the intestine and the gills, Gene Ontology (GO) annotation showed that the main enriched terms were biological regulation, cellular process, metabolic process, cellular anatomical entity, and binding. KEGG enrichment analysis on DEGs revealed that the dominant pathways were carbohydrate metabolism and lipid metabolism, which were strongly influenced by MPs in the intestine. The dominant pathways in the gills were immune and lipid metabolism. The respiratory rate of gills, the activity of SOD and GSH in the intestine significantly increased after exposure to MPs compared with the control (p<e2><80><89><<e2><80><89>0.05), while the activity of SOD did not change in the gills. GSH activity was only significantly increased after MP exposure for 5 days. Also, the MDA content was not changed in the intestine but was significantly decreased in the gills after MP exposure. The activity of AChE significantly decreased only after MPs exposure for 5 days. Overall, these results indicated that MPs pollution significantly induced oxidative stress and neurotoxicity, increased respiratory rate, disturbed energy metabolism and stimulated immune function in fish, displaying an environmental risk of MPs to aquatic ecosystems.},

Spring and summer were the seasons with the highest fouling rates, as well as densities of fouling organisms. The highest levels of diversity were recorded during the colder seasons. Several interactions between the organisms were identified, such as mutualism, commensalism, competition, epibiosis, cannibalism, and predation.

abstract={Understanding habitat use and reproductive biology of invasive species is essential to predicting invasions, designing early detection programs, and developing management plans. The rudd (Scardinius erythrophthalmus; Linnaeus, 1758) is an omnivorous fish native to Europe and western Asia that has been translocated to several countries in western Europe, New Zealand, North America, and Africa. However, little is known about early life history of rudd, particularly in invaded ecosystems, limiting our ability to predict invasions and create early detection and control programs. The upper Niagara River has the most abundant population of rudd in North America and has been the focus of several ecological investigations. Our study identified critical nursery habitats by determining which nearshore habitat factors were most strongly associated with presence of age-0 rudd. We found that emergent vegetation was the most important habitat characteristic associated with the presence of age-0 rudd. When emergent vegetation was not present, rudd were more likely to be present at sites with abundant submerged aquatic vegetation. Additionally, the odds of rudd presence decreased as distance to the nearest wetland increased. These findings can be used to create habitat-driven predictive models of rudd invasion and guide early detection programs for rudd outside their native range.},

abstract={The European Water Framework Directive implements the policies to achieve a good ecological status of all European waterbodies. To determine the ecological potential in freshwater environments, abiotic (morphology, physical and chemical variables) and biotics (algae, fishes, etc.) metrics are used. Despite their importance in trophic web, zooplankton was not included as one of the Biological Quality Elements (BQE) to determine the water quality. In the present research, we studied the zooplankton species that can be considered as indicators of trophic status and ecological potential for more than 60 water reservoirs. The data were obtained from more of 300 samples collected during 10<c2><a0>years from reservoirs at Ebro River watershed, which is the largest basin in Spain. According to their physicochemical and biological elements, the trophic status and ecological potential of these reservoirs were established. More than 150 zooplankton species were identified during the study. The results from this research indicate that species that are related with low water quality are: Acanthocyclops americanus, Ceriodaphnia spp., Daphnia cucullata, Daphnia p<c3><a1>rvula, Diaphanosoma brachyurum, Brachionus angularis, Keratella cochlearis and Phompolyx sulcata. An indicator of moderate quality was Bosmina longirostris, while Daphnia longispina, Ascomorpha ovalis and Ascomorpha saltans were considered as indicators of good water quality. The data obtained suggest that zooplankton species can be used as a valuable tool to determine the water quality status and should be considered, in a near future, as one more of the BQE within the WFD metrics.},

Among the long-term lakes, the greatest dissimilarities in zooplankton community composition among years were in Lake Waahi, where the Australian Boeckella symmetrica was first detected in 2012. That is, the greatest temporal changes to zooplankton composition during the study period were due to the invasion by non-indigenous species, rather than changes in trophic state or other environmental variables; non-native species commonly dominated the individual counts of species through much of 2014 and 2015, with most samples since 2016 being again dominated by native species.

abstract={The spiny water flea (Bythotrephes cederstr<c3><b6>mii), a freshwater crustacean considered to be the world<e2><80><99>s best-studied invasive zooplankter, was first recorded in North America in the Laurentian Great Lakes during the 1980s. Its arrival is widely considered to be the result of ocean-going cargo ships that translocated contaminated ballast water from Eurasia to the Great Lakes during the 1970<e2><80><93>1980s. The subsequent first discovery of the species in inland lakes is consistent with the hypothesis that propagules dispersed initially from established Great Lakes populations. Here we present evidence of exoskeletal remains, including mandibles, tail spines, and resting eggs, in 210Pb-dated lake sediment cores, which suggests that B. cederstr<c3><b6>mii was already resident in four inland North American lakes (two in Minnesota, USA; two in Ontario, Canada) by at least the early 1900s. Densities of exoskeletal remains were low and relatively steady from first appearance until about 1990, after which time they increased in all cores. The earliest evidence that we found was a mandible at 33-cm depth (pre-1650) in the sediments of Three Mile Lake, Ontario, Canada. These unexpected findings challenge the current paradigm of B. cederstr<c3><b6>mii invasion, renew uncertainty about the timing and sequence of its colonization of North American lakes, and potentially question our ability to detect invasive species with traditional sampling methods. We attempted to eliminate errors in the dated stratigraphies of the exoskeletal remains that might have been introduced either methodologically (e.g., core-wall smearing) or naturally (e.g., bioturbation). Nonetheless, given the very low numbers of subfossils encountered, questions remain about the possible artifactual nature of our observations and therefore we regard our results as <e2><80><98>preliminary findings<e2><80><99> at this time.},

title={Epigenetic variation in animal populations: Sources, extent, phenotypic implications, and ecological and evolutionary relevance},
abstract={Laboratory experiments and fieldwork with asexually reproducing invertebrates and vertebrates clearly revealed that animal populations can produce substantial phenotypic variation despite genetic identity. This epigenetically caused phenotypic variation comes from two different sources, namely directional environmental induction and bed-hedging developmental stochasticity. Both occur together and are mediated by molecular epigenetic mechanisms like DNA methylation, histone modifications and microRNAs. These epigenetic mechanisms are also involved in insect polyphenism, phenotypic changes in early domestication, and gene expression change and chromatin rearrangement during speciation. Epigenetic variation is particularly important for asexual populations helping them to stay in the game of life when the environmental conditions change. However, it is also relevant for sexually reproducing populations, as shown for genetically impoverished invasive groups, cave animals and sessile taxa that cannot evade unfavourable environmental conditions. Experiments revealed that epigenetic marks can be transgenerationally inherited and persist for several generations. First evidence suggests that inherited epimutations with phenotypic effects may end-up in phenotype-fixing genetic mutations by accelerated mutation of methylated nucleotides. Refined concepts, suitable animal models, fast and affordable new omics techniques that require only small tissue samples, and appropriate data interpretation tools are now available enabling future investigations in ecological and evolutionary epigenetics with high accuracy.},

title={Declining Recruitment of Lake Whitefish to Fisheries in the Laurentian Great Lakes: Management Considerations and Research Priorities},
abstract={We conducted a review of the physical and biological processes that affect recruitment of Lake Whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) to commercial fisheries in the Laurentian Great Lakes because numerous stocks have declined precipitously since contemporary abundance and yield peaked in the late 1990s. Lake Whitefish recruitment dynamics are largely defined in nearshore high-energy zones <7 m deep where gametes are deposited in fall and fertilized embryos incubate over winter. Reproductive habitat constitutes about 2% of the total surface area of the Great Lakes, with most of it in Lake Huron, and over 75% of it in embayments. Lake Whitefish also spawns in tributaries, particularly those to Green Bay, Lake Michigan, and these stocks have expanded over the last decade in comparison to stocks in the lake's main basin, which have declined. Water temperatures of the Great Lakes have been increasing through time, reducing the density and duration of ice cover, which is important for protecting embryos from currents generated by strong winds. The amount and extent of ice cover has been declining since the late 1990s, and this trend will continue, negatively affecting recruitment. The role of water levels in recruitment remains unknown, but shallow nursery areas in embayments will be most affected by changing water levels. At least 93 reproductive habitats occur in the Great Lakes, and adult Lake Whitefish live mainly within a 110-km radius of their spawning shoals. Consequently, fishery yields comprise multiple spawning stocks that differ in their reproductive productivity. We identified 24 potential management areas where commercial-fishery and biological data can be pooled from adjacent spawning stocks into a single larger mixed-stock fishery assessment, which should produce less-biased estimates of spawning-stock biomass than if individual stocks were treated as though mixing did not occur. The 2003 to 2012 year-classes, produced at high levels of adult abundance, experienced the greatest declines in recruitment. The number of recruits per kilogram of spawners declined 76-80% in Lakes Michigan and Huron but doubled in Lake Superior. Correspondence between larval density and subsequent year-class production appears to be uncorrelated, but the relationship is likely driven by the ratio of zooplankton density to larval density. Abundant calanoid and cyclopoid copepods in waters <7 m deep during late March through early May are critical for growth and survival of larvae. Based on distribution in fall and winter, Round Goby (Neogobius melanostomus) may not negatively affect Lake Whitefish reproduction. We conclude that predation of Lake Whitefish by Lake Trout (Salvelinus namaycush) has not been a cause of the declines in recruitment. Although Sea Lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) kills adult Lake Whitefish, it also is not a cause of the recent declines in recruitment. Pathogens and parasites may have played a role in the decline in Lake Whitefish stocks in the Great Lakes. Changes in the food web of the four lower Great Lakes due to expansion of dreissenids (Dreissena polymorpha and D. bugensis) have probably affected the physical and biological productivity of Lake Whitefish reproductive habitat, but the specific mechanism(s) remains unknown. Spawning biomass appears sufficient to support both recruitment and fisheries, but survival of early life stages is insufficient, suggesting that carrying capacity of reproductive habitats has been degraded during 2000-2019. We do not view stocking as an effective tool for managing Lake Whitefish in the Great Lakes, but if stocking is to be undertaken, agencies must ensure that stocked fish can be distinguished from naturally produced fish at all life stages. We recommend that managers on Lakes Michigan, Huron, and Ontario establish a Lake Whitefish working group; give high priority to research targeted at estimating the unfished biomass of stocks; create areas that provide additional protection from exploitation for a portion of the year; provide the least-productive stocks additional protections from exploitation; reduce current levels of exploitation on the most highly fished stocks; expand the length of spawning-season closures or implement a spawning-season closure, if one does not exist; and reduce the maximum-total-mortality-control rule to less than 65% where it is used to set harvest limits. Lastly, we recommend the creation of a small-scale dreissenid control program with the goal of increasing primary production and Lake Whitefish recruitment in reproductive habitats of Lakes Michigan, Huron, and Ontario.},

title={Invasive lionfish detected in estuaries in the northern Gulf of Mexico using environmental DNA},
abstract={Invasive lionfish are considered to be one of the worst marine invaders primarily due to their threat as predators to native species. The distribution of lionfish across their invasive range has been fairly well characterized, but their presence within estuaries is largely unknown. While removal of invasive lionfish is the primary mode of managing the invasion, early detection in new locations could be valuable for documenting range expansion. Environmental DNA (eDNA) has become a useful tool to identify the presence of invasive species prior to establishment and may be especially valuable for systems that are challenging to survey. In this study, an environmental DNA assay was developed and successfully identified the presence of lionfish DNA in four riverine estuaries in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Detections were significantly higher in July but did not vary by location. Occupancy modeling shows that the assay is not exceptionally sensitive and may be underreporting the presence of lionfish, possibly due to the effect of salinity. The presence of invasive lionfish within estuaries could put native fish and invertebrates at risk, especially species that use these systems as nurseries. Ongoing monitoring using molecular methods may be useful in the management of invasive lionfish by providing early detection of fish moving into systems that neighbor known invaded regions.},

title={Mussel biology: from the byssus to ecology and physiology, including microplastic ingestion and deep-sea adaptations},
abstract={Mussels are a group of bivalves that includes the dominant species of shallow-sea, freshwater, and deep-sea chemosynthetic ecosystems. Mussels cling to various solid underwater surfaces using a proteinaceous thread, called the byssus, which is central to their ecology, physiology, and evolution. Mussels cluster using their byssi to form â€œmussel beds,â€ thereby increasing their biomass per unit of habitat area, and also creating habitats for other organisms. Clustered mussels actively filter feed to obtain nutrients, but also ingest pollutants and suspended particles; thus, mussels are good subjects for pollution analyses, especially for microplastic pollution. The byssus also facilitates invasiveness, allowing mussels to hitchhike on ships, and to utilize other man-made structures, including quay walls and power plant inlets, which are less attractive to native species. Physiologically, mussels have adapted to environmental stressors associated with a sessile lifestyle. Osmotic adaptation is especially important for life in intertidal zones, and taurine is a major component of that adaptation. Taurine accumulation systems have also been modified to adapt to sulfide-rich environments near deep-sea hydrothermal vents. The byssus may have also enabled access to vent environments, allowing mussels to attach to â€œevolutionary stepping stonesâ€ and also to vent chimneys.},

Model averaging from a suite of linear mixed models showed that saltmarsh sparrows averaged 20.1% higher blood THg concentrations than seaside sparrows, potentially due to differences in diet or foraging behavior.

Overall, our results suggest considerable, unexplained variation in tidal marsh sparrow blood THg concentrations over their co-occurring breeding ranges.},

abstract={Twenty-nine surface sediments from Chaohu Lake in China and from its six main tributaries were sampled to investigate the concentrations of two important polycyclic musks (PCMs), 1,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydro-4,6,6,7,8,8-hexamethylcyclopenta(g)-2-benzopyran (galaxolide, HHCB) and 7-acetyl-1,1,3,4,4,6-hexamethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene (tonalide, AHTN), as well as the concentration of 4,6,7,8-hexahydro-4,6,6,7,8,8-hexamethylcyclopenta(g)-2-benzopyran-1-one (galaxolidon, HHCB-lactone), which is the main degradation product of HHCB. Except for the high concentrations of AHTN and HHCB measured in the Nanfei River (879<c2><a0>ng/g dw and 5,513<c2><a0>ng/g dw, respectively), the levels of AHTN and HHCB in the river sediments were 7.08<e2><80><93>44.9<c2><a0>ng/g dw and 20.6<e2><80><93>268<c2><a0>ng/g dw, respectively, which are slightly lower than those documented in various areas worldwide. The concentrations of AHTN and HHCB in the sediments of Chaohu Lake were one or two orders of magnitude lower than those in the tributary rivers and showed a clear regional distribution. The concentrations of HHCB-lactone were comparable to those of HHCB and presented a significant positive correlation with the concentrations of HHCB, suggesting that the HHCB-lactone originated directly from the degradation of HHCB in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) or in the natural environment. The diagnostic ratios of HHCB/AHTN and HHCB-lactone/HHCB and the enantiomeric fractions (EFs) of these PCMs showed that the direct origins of the target PCMs in the study area were municipal and industrial wastewaters discharged from adjacent cities or point sources and that the HHCB-lactone in sediment originated from the natural degradation of HHCB in the rivers and the lake. The results of the risk assessment showed that the PCMs in the watershed sediments were unlikely to pose a threat to aquatic species. However, the effluents of industrial and municipal wastewaters that are discharged into the Nanfei River should be investigated in future research.},

If this species<e2><80><99> range is shifting due to climate change, it could further impact the integrity of ecological communities. To map the distribution of H. nehereus, we developed an ensemble species distribution model and projected the present and future habitat suitability in Chinese coastal waters. Annual mean benthic water temperature was identified as the most important variable affecting the projected distribution of H. nehereus, followed by water depth and salinity. Currently suitable habitats are along the coast from Guangxi Province to the southern Jiangsu Province. As climate changes, the southern portion of its distribution is predicted to recede with habitat losses, and the overall suitable habitat will shift northward. To avoid the potential impacts of H. nehereus redistribution, precautionary management based on species distribution modeling would help to maintain healthy marine ecosystems in the newly invaded areas.},

Abundances of six Wabash River species varied temporally, and three had stronger relationships with year than the other species: common carp (Cyprinus carpio) decreased before and after silver carp introduction, freshwater drum (Aplodinotus grunniens) increased prior to silver carp introduction, and gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum) decreased before silver carp introduction. Silver carp abundance was significantly correlated only with abundance of gizzard shad. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis of long-term Wabash River fish assemblages resulted in distinctive temporal and spatial patterns. Silver carp abundance increased from zero in the early 1990s to 28 individuals/km in recent years. Gizzard shad declined to low abundance simultaneous to silver carp increases, yet we did not detect significant patterns for silver carp with other Wabash River fishes.},

abstract={Redspot Chub (Nocomis asper) are a keystone species in Ozark Highland streams of the Arkansas River drainage because their unique mound-building reproductive behavior facilitates recruitment of nest associates. Data contributing to an increased understanding of Redspot Chub natural history is required for the conservation of this species as it is listed as a species of concern throughout most its range. The findings presented within thoroughly describe Redspot Chub feeding ecology by documenting an ontogenetic diet shift, patterns of seasonal resource use, important prey taxa, estimates of trophic position and dietary niche breadth, as well as documenting feeding strategies at population and individual levels. Diet collections were conducted seasonally in 2018 and 2019 at four sites on Spavinaw Creek in Arkansas and Oklahoma. Logistic regression provided evidence for a previously undescribed ontogenetic diet shift, which split Redspot Chub into two functionally different species from a dietary perspective. Redspot Chub >162 mm total length (TL, RSCB) occupied a significantly higher trophic level than Redspot Chub <162 mm TL (RSCS). In terms of caloric contribution, Ringed Crayfish (Faxonius neglectus neglectus) nearly accounted for the entire diet of RSCB, regardless of season. This specialization led to a much lower overall dietary niche breadth when compared to RSCS. Furthermore, Amundsen plots clearly depicted RSCB population specialization on crayfish. Conversely, Trichoptera were the most important prey across seasons for RSCS. Cole<c3><b3>ptera, Ringed Crayfish, and Ephemeroptera ranked second in importance at different times seasonally. RSCS also possessed a relatively narrow niche width, but Amundsen plots exhibited a pattern where seasonally the two most important prey types were specialized on by approximately half the population, while smaller proportions of the population specialized on less commonly used prey resources. Species' diets reflect an integration of numerous ecological components; therefore, our aim was to provide a greater understanding of Redspot Chub feeding ecology that may be useful for informing future conservation assessments and management decisions.},

abstract={Several potential genotoxins found in water samples arise from anthropogenic activities. Acid mine effluent resulting from coal mining poses serious environment concerns all over the world. The use of toxicity tests to evaluate the quality of streams add value by providing site-specific toxicological data. Treatment systems such as the use of natural wetlands (passive) or conventional physical and chemical pH-neutralised processes (active) are employed mainly to meet certain water quality guidelines. Nonetheless, potential genotoxins or residues remain which influence the quality of discharged effluents. The objective of this study was to evaluate the genotoxic potential of acid mine drainage (AMD) released into a natural stream following treatment by passive and active methods. This study aimed to identify the extent of AMD mutagenicity and genotoxicity to African Vero monkey kidney cell line and a fish gill cell line (RTgill-W1) using two assays, the Ames test, and the comet assay, as a rapid and effective screening tool. The Ames test performed without metabolic activation using Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 strains showed no indication of mutagenicity in the water samples tested. Differing results were however obtained for the comet assay using the African Vero monkey kidney cell line and a fish gill cell line (RTgill-W1), which revealed DNA fragmentation and variations in morphologies indicative of genotoxicity in the water samples following the two treatment processes. A significant reduction in DNA damage was observed in water samples following active treatment of the AMD, evidenced by reduced damage frequency and a lowered comet score. This bioassay confirms the urgency of integrating high-throughput screening in aquatic toxicity assessment at genetic levels, giving further evidence that in-vitro bioassays can be incorporated for use in short-term genotoxicity assays. The result suggests that the comet assay proved sensitive at detecting genotoxicity, supporting the integration of this into environmental monitoring frameworks targeted at AMD-contaminated sites.},

We investigated the impact of suspended microplastics on the energy budget of the mussels Mytilus coruscus using the Cellular Energy Allocation (CEA) approach. The mussels were exposed to control conditions (no microplastics) or to one of the three concentrations of 2 <ce><bc>m polystyrene microspheres (10, 104, and 106 particles/L) for 14 days, followed by 7 days of recovery. Exposure to high concentrations of microplastics (104 or 106 particles/L) increased cellular energy demand (measured as the activity of the mitochondrial electron transport system, ETS) and depleted cellular energy stores (carbohydrates, lipids and proteins) in the mussels whereas exposure to 10 particles/L had no effect. Carbohydrate levels decreased already after 7 days of microplastics exposure and were restored after 7 days of recovery. In contrast, the tissue levels of lipids and proteins declined more slowly (after 14 days of exposure) and did not fully recover after 7 days following the removal of microplastics. Therefore, the total energy content and the CEA declined after 7-14 days of exposure to high microplastics concentrations, and remained suppressed during 7 days of subsequent recovery. These findings demonstrate a negative impact of microplastics on energy metabolism at the cellular level that cannot be restored during a short time recovery. Given a close link of CEA with the organismal energy balance, suppression of CEA by microplastics exposure suggests that bioenergetics disturbances might lead to decreases in growth and productivity of mussels<e2><80><99> populations in environments with heavy microplastics loads.},

abstract={Nanotechnology has been widely used, with nanomaterials being applied in several technologies. However, little is known about the real toxicological risk that can be caused by nanomaterials. These materials can be divided according to their dimensionalities. The current classification schemes for nanostructured materials are based on these dimensionalities, generally as zero (0D), one (1D), two (2D), and three dimensions (3D). Toxicological studies to present broad and consistent information on nanomaterials toxicity mechanisms, in vitro and in vivo studies in several experimental models are necessary. Thus, this short review presents the toxicological potential of carbon nanomaterials, divided by their dimensionality, in the main in vitro and in vivo experimental models, especially alternative models. As a result, it was possible to observe that the toxicity of carbon nanomaterials does not vary according to the dimensionality of 0D, 1D, and 2D materials. For these materials, it is not possible to infer a direct relationship between dimensionality and toxicity. However, recent studies have shown that three-dimensional graphene species tend to have less toxicity than materials with a smaller number of dimensions. Finally, it was possible to note the importance of using several experimental models, especially alternative models, in order to increase the understanding of toxicity mechanisms of carbon nanomaterials.},

abstract={Soil pollution due to the activities of industrial parks, is becoming an increasingly serious issue, particularly throughout China. Therefore, it is essential to explore the soil pollution characteristics and its ecotoxicological effects on model species, such as higher plant species, in typical industrial areas. In this study, concentrations of heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were examined in the soil collected from 10 sampling sites at a chemical industry park in Nanjing, China. The pollution index was used to assess the heavy metal pollution level of soils, while the hazard index (HI) and carcinogenic risk index (RI) were calculated to assess the human health risk of soil PAHs. In addition, wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was used as the model species to evaluate the ecotoxicological effects of polluted soil in pot experiments. Results showed that the content of heavy metals and PAHs varied greatly in soil samples, among which the heavy metal pollution at S1, S2 and S3 was the most serious. The health risk assessment of PAHs indicated that non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic values for all soil samples were below the threshold levels. Statistical analysis of the correlation between contaminated soil and toxic effects in wheat found that the significance values of regression equations were all less than 0.05 for chlorophyll content, peroxidase (POD) and amylase (AMS) activity. This indicates that the chlorophyll content, POD and AMS activity in wheat leaves could be suitable biomarkers for evaluation of the combined toxicity of multiple pollutants. This study provides a reference for future research on the risk assessment of soil containing multiple pollutants from industrial chemical parks.},

title={Shell morphology, growth and longevity of <i>Unio tumidus</i> (Bivalvia: Unionidae) from an archaeological site and contemporary population inhabiting the Oder estuary},
abstract={Mussel shells are often found in archaeological excavations and can provide information useful for ecological reconstruction and assessment of anthropogenic impact on waters. In this study, two sample groups of swollen river mussel (Unio tumidus) which occurred during the Early Middle Ages (EMS) and currently (MS) in the Oder river estuary (Baltic basin) were compared. Allometric shell growth, morphological characteristics of the shell (length, width, height and thickness), age structure and growth of mussels were analysed using the von Bertalanffy equation. All three types of allometric growth (isometry and both positive and negative allometry) were observed in the studied mussels. In both groups, typical values of shell length, width, height and thickness were recorded. However, higher values of these morphological characteristics were recorded in the EMS group. Moreover, the EMS group, compared with the MS group of U. tumidus, was characterised by a higher longevity (12 and 10<c2><a0>years, respectively) and asymmetric length (L<e2><88><9e>) (93.09 and 83.23<c2><a0>mm, respectively). Both groups of mussels had a similar growth rate (k). Larger shell sizes in the EMS group were probably caused by differential preservation and/or differential archaeological recovery, and resulted from differences in the age structure, especially higher mortality rate amongst individuals older than 6<c2><a0>years in the MS group.},

title={Measuring the Impact of the COVID-19 Shutdown on Great Lakes Water Quality Using Remote Sensing},
abstract={The states of Michigan and Ohio issued shutdown orders in mid-March 2020 in an attempt to slow the spread of COVID-19, resulting in widespread disruption to economic and human activity. This study, which was commissioned by NASA headquarters, utilized satellite remote sensing data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) satellite to investigate whether these changes in activity led to any short-term changes in water quality in the Great Lakes region by comparing 2020 data to a historic baseline. The water quality parameters examined included chlorophyll-a (CHL) and total suspended solids (TSS) concentrations, water clarity, and harmful algal bloom (HAB) extent. These parameters were investigated in two Great Lakes basins which experience significant anthropogenic pressure: the western basin of Lake Erie (WBLE) and Saginaw Bay in Lake Huron (SBLH). TSS concentrations in April 2020 were below the historic baseline in both basins, and largely remained low until September. SBLH also experienced elevated CHL concentrations in April which persisted through the summer. Additionally, the WBLE HAB extent was down in 2020 after an early end to the growing season. However, this investigation found that the COVID-19 shutdowns were likely not a direct driver of these short-term anomalies. Instead, recent trends in the indicators and co-occurring anomalies in hydrological and meteorological conditions (e.g., lake temperature, river discharge, and wind speed) appeared to be more responsible for the detected water quality changes. Future work will investigate whether the shutdowns have a long-term or delayed impact on Great Lakes water quality.},

title={Reproduction Under Stress: Acute Effect of Low Salinities and Heat Waves on Reproductive Cycle of Four Ecologically and Commercially Important Bivalves},
abstract={Given the ecological and socioeconomic importance of estuaries, the impacts of climate change on their structure and functioning is a major focus of concern, even more when the affected species support important fisheries as the venerid clams Ruditapes decussatus, R. philippinarum, Venerupis corrugata, and the cockle Cerastoderma edule in Europe whose reproductive performance, in the context of climate stressors, has not yet been investigated. Thus, our objective was to experimentally evaluate the potential effect of low salinity and atmospheric heatwave stresses on their reproductive cycle. To test it, bivalves were exposed during six days to four different salinity ramps (5-20, 10-25, 15-30, 30-30) during simulated tidal cycles over three different periods of the year (autumn, winter and spring); also, in summer, they were exposed to atmospheric heatwaves at low tide (20, 27, 32, 37<c2><b0>C) during four consecutive days. Histological slides were analyzed to determine their gametogenetic stage and a gonadal index was calculated. Both low salinity and heatwave stresses compromised reproduction but the response was species-specific dependent and varied with the time of the year, therefore with the gametogenic cycle. In December, during sexual resting and the beginning of gametogenesis, a delay in the gametogenesis was recorded in the four species at lower salinities. In March and May, at the peak of the reproductive period, the response was different; abnormal oocytes in R. decussatus and resorption of gametes with hemocytic infiltration in R. philippinarum and V. corrugata were observed. Sediment temperatures higher than 32<c2><ba>C provoked gonadal resorption and severe hemocytic invasion in V. corrugata, R. decussatus and C. edule but no effect in R. philippinarum. These responses were related to the allocation of energy from reproduction towards defense and repair mechanisms to ensure survival. Contrastingly, low salinities triggered massive spawning in C. edule that could lead to a mismatch between the presence of larvae and phytoplankton, causing potentially starvation and thus reducing recruitment success. For short-lived species as these bivalves if low salinity episodes in winter and spring are followed by a heatwave in summer, reproduction would be compromised, and the impact magnified if this situation happens during consecutive years},

Results showed that the reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), mortality and deformity rate were increased in the presence of MC-LR accompanied with the reduction of the glutathione peroxidase (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and hatching rate of the zebrafish embryo. The higher the MC-LR concentration was, the stronger the developmental and oxidative stress response (p < 0.05). This study confirmed that the supplementation of astaxanthin could significantly alleviate the toxic effects of MC-LR on zebrafish embryos. The mortality and deformity rates decreased significantly in the combined exposure group compared with the only MC-LR exposure group, and the decreasing rates were positively correlated with the astaxanthin concentration. Astaxanthin could also significantly improve the oxidative stress response and damage caused by MC-LR. The ROS and MDA contents of juvenile fish decreased, whereas GSH, SOD and T-AOC increased significantly with astaxanthin supplementation. Therefore, astaxanthin might be a suitable diet supplement against the MC-LR contamination of pond aquaculture.},

title={Nuclei isolation protocols for flow cytometry allowing nuclear DNA content estimation in problematic microalgal groups},
abstract={Microalgae are fundamentally important organisms for global ecosystem functioning with high potential in biotechnology and its applications. The knowledge of their nuclear DNA content has become a prerequisite for many areas of microalgal research. Due to common presence of various pigments, secondary metabolites and complex cell walls, the nuclear DNA content estimation using flow cytometry (FCM) is, however, often laborious or even impossible with the currently used protocols. In this study the performance of six nuclei isolation protocols was compared on various problematic microalgae using FCM. The nuclei isolation methods involved osmotic bursting of cells, razor blade chopping of fresh biomass and two newly introduced protocols, razor blade chopping of desiccated biomass and bead beating. These techniques also involved the use of two different nuclei isolation solutions, Otto I + II solutions, and LB01 buffer. Performance of the particular protocols differed greatly, depending on the used nuclei isolation solution and microalgal group. The most successful method was a newly adopted chopping of desiccated biomass in LB01 buffer. This method seems more appropriate for nuclei isolation in filamentous microalgae; on the other hand, bead beating appears to be more suitable for nuclei isolation in solitarily living algae. Using the optimal protocol for a given species, their nuclear DNA content was estimated, resulting in first DNA content estimates for four investigated taxa (Chlamydomonas noctigama, Gonyostomum semen, Microglena sp. and Stigeoclonium sp.). The estimated DNA content spanned from 0.15 to 32.52 pg.},

Along with the growth hormones, insulin-like growth factor signalling is very pivotal in the growth and development of all vertebrates. In fishes, insulin-like growth factors play an important role in osmoregulation, besides the neuroendocrine regulation of growth. Insulin-like growth factor concentration in plasma can assess the growth in fishes and shellfishes and therefore widely applied in nutritional research as an indicator to evaluate the performance of selected nutrients. The present review summarizes the role of insulin-like growth factor signalling in fishes and shellfishes, its significance in aquaculture and in evaluating growth, reproduction and development, and discusses the utility of this system as biomarkers for early indication of growth in aquaculture.},

abstract={The round goby, Neogobius melanostomus (Pallas, 1814), is a fish of Ponto-Caspian origin that has been invading the Baltic Sea since the 1990s. Currently, it is abundant and commercially important in some areas of the sea. This species was first reported in the eastern Gulf of Finland (GoF) in 2012. Its occurrence increased thereafter, however it has remained largely unstudied in this region. The aim of this study was to investigate the population characteristics of the round goby in the eastern GoF to better understand its expansion trend and whether it will become abundant enough to be exploited by the local fishery. Fish were caught using multi-mesh gillnets (12-60 mm mesh) and a beach seine (0.5-10 mm mesh). Occurrence, density, catch per unit effort, biomass per unit effort, relative number and biomass in catches, as well as age, size and sex ratio were studied. The species regularly occurred in samplings along the southern coastline of the GoF, as well as some central areas and along the northern coast. Within 2012-2019, its occurrence in catches increased, with the highest frequency in 2015-2019 in shallow waters (<1.5 m) of Koporye Bay (70%) and in the deeper waters of Narva Bay (74%). Similarly, the highest density in the shallow waters was also observed in Koporye Bay (10.0 ind. * 100 m-2), and offshore in Narva Bay. Relative abundance and biomass usually did not exceed 23%, although it reached 93% in Narva Bay. The oldest specimen was five years old. Young-of-the-year (YOY) juveniles predominated in the shallow waters (85%), while three-year-olds prevailed in deeper waters (75%). Among the fish older than two years, females were more predominant (mean ratio 3 to 1), and males were larger than females. Specimens in all life stages were found in the eastern GoF, and their abundance increased annually, suggesting that the round goby has successfully colonized this region of the Baltic Sea. However, compared to other areas of the Baltic Sea inhabited by longer-established populations, its population size is still relatively low.},

abstract={The presence and status of harmful algal blooms (HABs) in Japan are reviewed, revealing a decrease in red tides; however, toxic blooms are found to be increasing in western Japan. Environmentally friendly control strategies against HABs are also compared with integrated agricultural pest management. Very high densities (105â€“108Â CFU/g) of algicidal and growth-inhibiting bacteria were found in biofilm on seagrass and seaweed surfaces and in surrounding coastal seawater. The situation in freshwater ecosystems is similar to coastal seas for toxic cyanobacterium, Microcystis aeruginosa, and aquatic plants. These findings offer new insights into the ecology of influential bacteria and harmful algae, suggesting that protection and restoration of native seagrasses and seaweeds in coastal marine environments should be implemented to suppress HABs. Diatom blooms were successfully induced with bottom sediment perturbation to prevent the occurrence of harmful flagellates such as Chattonella spp. and Alexandrium catenella in the Seto Inland Sea; however, this method requires robust and reproducible verification. â€œSato-Umiâ€ is a helpful concept for HAB control in the sea and freshwater ecosystems when adequately managed by people (e.g., appropriate bottom perturbation; protection and restoration of seaweeds, seagrasses, and aquatic plants; application of polycultures of fish, seaweeds, etc.).},

abstract={Dissolved calcium concentration [Ca2+] is thought to be a major factor limiting the establishment and thus the spread of invasive bivalves such as zebra (Dreissena polymorpha) and quagga (Dreissena bugensis) mussels. We measured [Ca2+] in 168 water samples collected along ~100 riverâ€km of the lower Columbia River, USA, between June 2018 and March 2020. We found [Ca2+] to range from 13 to 18â€‰mgâ€‰Lâˆ’1 during summer/fall and 5 to 22â€‰mgâ€‰Lâˆ’1 during the winter/spring. Previous research indicates that [Ca2+]â€‰<â€‰12â€‰mgâ€‰Lâˆ’1 are likely to limit the establishment and spread of invasive bivalves. Thus, our results indicate that there is sufficient Ca2+ in most locations in the lower Columbia River to support the establishment of invasive dreissenid mussels, which could join the already widespread and abundant Asian clam (Corbicula fluminea) as the newest invader to an already heavily invaded Columbia River ecosystem. These new data provide important measurements from a heretofore undersampled region of the Columbia River and have important implications for the spread of invasive bivalves and, by extension, the conservation and management of native species and ecosystems.},

abstract={Molluscs are among the most diverse and widespread animal groups in freshwater habitats. Unfortunately, like most freshwater taxa, they are decreasing dramatically and are now among the most threatened animals on Earth, with many species already extinct or on the brink of extinction. Here, we review our current knowledge on the biodiversity and conservation of freshwater molluscs using the concept of knowledge shortfalls. We focus on seven previously proposed key shortfalls to review and analyse existing knowledge gaps relating to (1) taxonomy, the Linnean Shortfall; (2) distribution, the Wallacean Shortfall; (3) abundance and population dynamics, the Prestonian Shortfall: (4) evolution, the Darwinian Shortfall; (5) abiotic tolerances, the Hutchinsonian Shortfall; (6) traits, the Raunkiaeran Shortfall; and (7) biotic interactions, the Eltonian Shortfall. In addition, we address a new shortfall, which relates to the application and effectiveness of conservation measures, including assessments, methods, funding, and policies, the Ostromian Shortfall. Based on our review, we provide recommendations and suggest pathways to overcome these existing shortfalls. This work also introduces the articles in this special issue of Hydrobiologia, which represent key contributions to the First International Freshwater Mollusk Conservation Society Meeting held in Verbania, Italy, in 2018.},

The Snake River in the St. Croix Basin, Minnesota, had low levels of suspended sediments and was surrounded mostly by forest and some developed land. The Chippewa, Cottonwood, and Le Sueur rivers in the Minnesota River Basin had significantly higher annual suspended sediment loads and highly agricultural basins. Mussel growth was highest in the Le Sueur and Cottonwood rivers followed by the Chippewa and the Snake rivers. Mussels in the Minnesota Basin rivers all had higher mussel foot glycogen concentrations than the Snake River. These patterns were similar for two mussel species, suggesting that environmental conditions are likely determining levels of growth. Although agriculture had a negative effect on mussel population abundance and diversity, it had a positive effect on growth and glycogen levels.},

Here, we studied the patterns of offspring production and growth in the Asian mussel Sinanodonta woodiana inhabiting the thermal plume of the Odra River in Central Europe. Compared to the S. woodiana males, females had more convex shells and had a greater tendency to continue post-maturation growth and thus follow an indeterminate growth pattern. Gravid females were observed all-year round, and individuals with either large or more convex shells brooded more offspring. The proportion of incubating females, brood size and glochidia size were linked to gonadal activity and changed seasonally. Females with a higher amount of nutritive substances in the ovaries produced more and larger offspring. The smallest and the largest offspring occurred in the summer and in the winter, respectively. Sinanodonta woodiana incubated different offspring generations simultaneously, constantly releasing them into the environment.

We describe two sets of primers (for Unionida and Venerida) developed for freshwater bivalves eDNA metabarcoding. These primers have been tested in the field, with about 300 studied sites. Results were compared to freshwater bivalves<e2><80><99> surveys using traditional methods, with eDNA always detecting more species than traditional surveys, especially when Sphaerids were taken into account. While our study initially focused on Western Palearctic freshwater bivalve species, our primers were confronted in silico with available sequences and have proven to be effective at a global scale. The results show that eDNA metabarcoding, with our developed primers, is a remarkable tool allowing for non-invasive surveys, detection of rare and inconspicuous species, absence data and overall freshwater bivalves routine monitoring.},

title={Lipid bound phosphorus in the seston of Lake Erie and its tributaries and its use as an indicator of algal P-limitation},
abstract={Concentrations of lipid-phosphorus (LP) in aquatic ecosystems can be influenced by algal biomass and the nutritional state of microbial communities, potentially serving a useful indicator of P-limitation. We examined the effectiveness of LP as a bioindicator by examining concentrations of LP and environmental factors controlling its abundance across Lake Erie and its tributaries. LP concentrations were correlated with chlorophyll a (Chl a) and total suspended solids, total P, and particulate carbon (PC), nitrogen, and P (PP) in both river and lake waters, while dissolved nutrients were only related to lake LP concentrations. Tributary LP was generally higher than in-lake values, and stoichiometric relationships between PC, PP, and LP indicated that Chl a was correlated with tributary LP. Chl a, bacterial production, and LP concentrations decreased significantly across nutrient gradients going from the west to east across the lake. Consistent relationships between lake particulate C:P ratios and Chl a: LP ratios were found across seasons, and higher values of both in August suggested algal P-limitation during this period. To further explore environmental controls on LP, we compared the relative influence of temperature, phytoplankton taxonomy, and water chemistry on lake LP concentrations. Though LP was correlated with well-known factors associated with cyanobacterial abundance in the lake (temperature and ammonium), particulate biomass and algal P-limitation seemed to be the most important correlates of LP concentration, suggesting that Chl a:LP ratios could provide a metric of P-limitation in aquatic ecosystems.},

title={Microplastics in Invasive Freshwater Mussels (Dreissena sp.): Spatiotemporal Variation and Occurrence With Chemical Contaminants},
abstract={Invasive zebra and quagga mussels (Dreissena spp.) in the Great Lakes of North America are biomonitors for chemical contaminants, but are also exposed to microplastics (< 5mm). Little research has examined in situ microplastic ingestion by dreissenid mussels, or the relationship between microplastics and chemical contaminants. We measured microplastics and chemical contaminants in mussel tissue from Milwaukee Harbor (Lake Michigan, USA) harvested from reference locations and sites influenced by wastewater effluent and urban river discharge. Mussels were deployed in cages in the summer of 2018, retrieved after 30 and 60 days, sorted by size class, and analyzed for microplastics and body burdens of three classes of contaminants: alkylphenols, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, and petroleum biomarkers. Microplastics in mussels were higher in the largest mussels at the wastewater-adjacent site after 30 days deployment. However, there was no distinction among sites for microplastics in smaller mussels, and no differences among sites after 60 days of deployment. Microplastics and chemical contaminants in mussels were not correlated. Microplastics have a diversity of intrinsic and extrinsic factors which influence their ingestion, retention, and egestion by mussels, and which vary relative to chemicals. While dreissenid mussels may not serve as plastic pollution biomonitors like they can for chemical contaminants, microplastics in dreissenid mussels are widespread, variable, and have unknown effects on physiology, mussel-mediated ecosystem processes, and lake food webs. These data will inform our understanding of the spatial distribution of microplastics in urban freshwaters, the role of dreissenid mussels in plastic budgets, and models for the fate of plastic pollution.},

title={Heavy Metal, Rare Earth Element and Pb Isotope Dynamics in Mussels During a Depuration Experiment in the Gulf of Aqaba, Northern Red Sea},
abstract={Mussels are considered highly efficient marine biomonitors, tracing anthropogenic and natural variations in heavy metals and various organic compounds. While heavy metals depuration processes in biomonitors are of growing interest, less knowledge is available regarding their Pb isotopes and rare earth elements (REEs) accumulation-release dynamics, and their response to short-term anthropogenic and terrigenous perturbations. Here, we report the results of a relocation experiment where a group of mussels (Brachidontes pharaonis) were extracted from a contaminated lagoon in the Gulf of Aqaba, northern Red Sea, and placed in water tables that were flushed continuously with fresh, uncontaminated seawater. Pairs of mussels were removed periodically from the water table over a period of 13 weeks and trace and rare earth elements and Pb isotopic compositions were determined separately for mussel shells and soft tissue. The results display a clear decrease over time in the concentrations of various heavy metals and REEs in the soft tissue, in concert with a similar shift in the Pb isotopic compositions towards seawater values. By contrast, the elemental and isotopic composition of the shell presents little change over time. Coupling between the Pb isotopic composition of corresponding soft tissue and shell samples allows back-calculation of the timing and magnitude of abrupt contamination events and provides quantitative constraints on long and short-term contamination events. Importantly however, considering the shallow coastal environment, the results may be biased by contributions of terrigenous material. Accordingly, Al-normalized element concentrations, Pb isotopes and the Ce anomalies, enabled the identification of two distinct terrigenous end members controlling the two sites. In summary, the study demonstrates the potential of using mussels as robust biomonitors of natural and anthropogenic environmental perturbations through the combination between elemental concentrations and the isotopic composition of Pb.},

title={Paddlefish, Polyodon spathula: Historical, current status and future aquaculture prospects in Russia},
abstract={In the wild, overfishing, habitat loss, industrial and agriculture activity has led to the degradation of freshwater habitats and, therefore, dramatically declines the Mississippi paddlefish (Polyodon spathula) stocks (Stone 2007). Paddlefish gain a growing commercial interest in the USSR/Russian Federation due to its ability to produce high-quality caviar. Also, it can be reared in polyculture ponds and a wide range of temperate reservoirs. Therefore, aquaculture of these valuable fish is necessary to meet consumer demand in Eastern European markets with flesh and caviar. Published information about the culture of paddlefish in the USSR/Russian Federation is scarce and not permanently available. Regarding our study, data were collected from English reports and translated Russian official statistics and studies. Also, FAO fisheries data from 1880 up to 2010 for paddleï¬sh were included. Moreover, caviar production data and prices were surveyed from companies. The collected data could briefly represent the historical and current status of paddlefish aquaculture and provide insight into the expected future production in the Russian Federation. Besides, it investigates the drawbacks of paddlefish aquaculture development and the potential challenges in Russian territories. Also, it discusses potential impacts related to the preservation of the breeding stocks, population naturalization and invasiveness of the species in the southern parts of Russia (i.e., in the Volgaâ€Caspian basin): Saratov, Rostov, Astrakhan Oblast and Krasnodar regions. Furthermore, this review aimed to gather the available data and the latest final findings that may address the welfare of paddlefish data to fill the knowledge gap towards improving the management of this species. In addition, future development prospects can be supported by government oversight through accurate accounting and financing for private farm activity.},

title={Impact of temperature on chlorination strategies for mussel control at water treatment plants},
abstract={Drinking water treatment plants in the Great Lakes often protect their intake structures against dreissenid biofouling by prechlorinating when water temperatures exceed 12 <c2><b0>C. This temperature threshold is based on the reproduction characteristics of zebra mussels. However, in recent years, zebra mussels have largely given way to quagga mussels in the region. These mussels reportedly reproduce at temperatures as low as 5 <c2><b0>C. The objective of this study was to determine if the current 12 <c2><b0>C trigger point for prechlorination remains appropriate. A 3-year monitoring program using bioboxes recorded mussel veliger concentrations and settlement potential in water drawn from the intakes of three drinking water treatment plants on Lake Ontario. Water temperature was a poor predictor of veliger presence and settlement. Reproduction and settlement were observed outside of the traditional temperature thresholds. Furthermore, no relationship was found between the number of veligers in the water column and those settling, suggesting that there are complex environmental factors that influence mussel activity. Nevertheless, it was observed that settlement occurred consistently between the months of July and November in the 3 years of the study. Therefore, a calendar-based approach to trigger prechlorination, as opposed to a temperature-based approach, is suggested.},

Neurotoxicity was evaluated using the acetylcholinesterase assay (AChE) and the physiological condition was assessed using the condition index (CI). A significant concentration-dependent increase of DNA damage was observed as well as a decline in the activities of the antioxidant enzymes. However, a decrease in DNA damage was observed with advancing time. A significant decrease of AChE activity and CI was observed in the bivalves exposed to MCP. Positive correlations were also observed between DNA damage and the antioxidant enzymes whereas negative correlations were observed between AChE and the antioxidant enzymes indicating MCP toxicity mediated by oxidative stress.},

title={Associations Between Winter Temperatures and the Timing and Duration of Annual Larval Recruitment of a Non-native Anomuran Crab},
abstract={The green porcelain crab, Petrolisthes armatus, a subtropical/tropical species, was first recorded on intertidal oyster reefs in South Carolina in 1995. Since then, its range has expanded north in a series of surges and setbacks that appear to be associated with particularly cold winters that may cause mortality. Petrolisthes armatus reproduces year-round in its native range whereas its reproductive season in the non-native range is limited to warmer months. Variation in the timing and duration of larval recruitment is not known for the non-native range and these factors may affect further range expansion. To determine whether P. armatus larval recruitment is related to temperature variation, in particular, the severity of winter temperatures, archival biweekly (every 2<c2><a0>weeks) larval samples collected 1994<e2><80><93>2018 near its northern range limit in the North Inlet Winyah Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR) were examined. The goal was to determine whether the timing and duration of larval ingress varied over time and was related to temperature variation. Petrolisthes armatus larvae were first observed in samples collected in 1995. There was considerable interannual variability in the timing of the start of recruitment (coefficient of variation 29%), which ranged from the last week of March at the earliest to the last week of July at the latest, for all years but one. Earlier annual recruitment was positively correlated with a longer recruitment duration. The timing of first larval recruitment was also related to the severity of the preceding winter, with later larval recruitment occurring in years with several consecutive days of cold temperatures. Cold winter temperatures appear to affect overwintering populations and their ability to reproduce in the early spring. A decreasing frequency of severe winters along the coastal South Atlantic Bight may promote further poleward range expansion of P. armatus.},

abstract={Ecological performance of animals depends on physiological and biochemical processes that are adjusted to the environment. The responses to hypoxia or anoxia have been frequently studied in subterranean aquatic organisms in order to find potential adaptations to restrict oxygen conditions occurring in the underground habitats. However, some previous studies have compared phylogenetic distant epigean and hypogean species or the epigean and hypogean populations of the same species due to little chance to compare closely related epigean and hypogean species. Therefore, in this study, we compared the effects of exposure to hypoxia, followed by reoxygenation, and increased temperature on oxygen consumption, potential metabolic activity, and antioxidant activities in closely related epigean and hypogean species: Niphargus zagrebensis and N. stygius. Oxygen consumption of N. stygius increased similarly during post-hypoxic recovery at 10 and 20<c2><b0>C (approx. 5-times), while N. zagrebensis increased its oxygen consumption for 9.7 and 4.4-times at 10 and 20<c2><b0>C, respectively. We observed higher exploitation of metabolic potential for current oxygen consumption during reoxygenation in N. zagrebensis than N. stygius. Exposure to hypoxia and subsequent reoxygenation at 20<c2><b0>C increased catalase (CAT) activity in N. stygius, but not in N. zagrebensis. We observed increased glutathione reductase activity in both Niphargus species. We concluded that respiratory and antioxidant responses to severe hypoxia and increased temperature differed between closely related epigean and hypogean Niphargus species. Hypogean Niphargus species possess physiological and biochemical characteristics that are advantageous in temperature stable subterranean environments which support inhabiting of species that have low energetic demands, while epigean Niphargus species can successfully inhabit specific surface habitats.},

abstract={Dreissenid bivalves (Dreissena polymorpha and D. rostriformis bugensis) are considered the most aggressive freshwater invaders inflicting profound ecological and economic impacts on the waterbodies that they colonize. Severity of these impacts depends on dreissenid population sizes which vary dramatically across space and time. We developed a novel method that analyzes video recorded using a Benthic Imaging System (BIS) in near real-time to assess dreissenid distribution and density across large waterbodies and tested it on Lake Erie. Lake Erie basins differ dramatically in morphometry, turbidity, and productivity, as well as in Dreissena distribution, density, and length-frequency distribution, providing an excellent model to test the applicability of our method across large and dynamic environmental gradients. Results of rapid assessment were subsequently compared with dreissenid density obtained from Ponar grab samples collected at the same sites. In the eastern and central basins, the differences in basin-wide density estimations from BIS and Ponar were 3% and 23%, respectively. In the western basin, this method had limited application due to high turbidity and abundance of small (<<e2><80><89>10<c2><a0>mm length) mussels. By substantially reducing the time required to assess dreissenids across large areas, rapid assessment could be a useful and cost-effective addition for monitoring their populations.},

abstract={Despite significant growth in the information on introduced species (NIS), agreement on their comparative fitness and effects on native (NAT) communities is heterogeneous. Hypotheses aimed at explaining their fitness and impacts are as often supported as challenged. In order to investigate whether origin is associated with fitness or impact, we reviewed 72 meta-analyses of trait differences between NAT and NIS, and impacts of NIS on NAT and the environment, covering terrestrial and aquatic organisms. Interpretation of the trends was based on overall meta-analysis conclusions, and on numbers of point estimates (individual effect sizes) within and across studies. Mixed results were found in 44% of the studies. Higher NIS fitness and significant impacts were found in 31%, and 25% concluded that significant outcomes are largely absent. Point estimates showed that non-significant outcomes (57%) are more common than significant ones. Two thirds yield mixed trait differences and impacts, or do not support the concept that NIS are more fit or have negative effects on NAT. When trait differences or impacts are significant, NAT are usually less fit, or are negatively impacted, but this trend is influenced by the fact that most surveys are based on the most damaging invasive species.},

abstract={River<e2><80><93>floodplain systems are characterized by high connectivity, which favours the spread of non-native species. In floodplain, floods increase connectivity, which increases the similarity of abiotic conditions among environments. High connectivity and low environmental variability may favour the establishment of non-native species such as Limnoperna fortunei, but this has not yet been tested. We sampled L. fortunei larvae in nine connected lakes and nine isolated lakes to rivers in the upper Paran<c3><a1> River floodplain to evaluate how spatial (connection) and abiotic (environmental variability) factors affect the larvae density of L. fortunei. We considered the rivers as propagule source of L. fortunei because this invasive species has successfully established in rivers, but not in lakes. Our findings revealed that connected lakes had a high larval density of L. fortunei, while isolated lakes had a low density. Isolated lakes presented a high multi-environmental variability, which was strong negatively related with the larval density of L. fortunei. However, the connectivity decreased the multi-environmental variability, indirectly increasing the larval density of L. fortunei. Our study illustrates that permanent connectivity with invaded environments increase the larvae density of L. fortunei in non-invaded environments, which occurs both directly (through propagule dispersion) and indirectly (by decreasing multi-environmental variability).},

Spread throughout more than 6700 km of the Western Atlantic Ocean coastline, O. mirabilis is the only species recorded as invasive. Higher plasticity in substrate use was detected in invaded areas than in native ones, which indicates that substrate availability does not limit the invasive potential of O. mirabilis. The colonization affinity of Ophiothela species is high for Cnidaria species, irrespective of population origin. High densities (e.g., up to 2.8 brittle stars<c2><a0>cm<e2><88><92>2 per gorgonian surface) and opportunistic habitat colonization pattern found for O. mirabilis invasive populations suggest fast dispersion rates along the Atlantic coast.

abstract={Ceratium furcoides is a freshwater dinoflagellate originally from cold waters of northern Europe that has been expanding its distribution into new areas worldwide. Species distribution modeling (SDM) based on maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt) showed that C. furcoides has a much wider potential range than its current distribution and isothermality as the key environmental variable determining its spatial pattern. The model successfully predicts areas of introduction and the climate matching approach has identified mainly tropical and some subtropical regions as most vulnerable areas at risk of introduction and establishment of C. furcoides. Furthermore, the observed shift of the climatic niche occurred between native and non-native ranges, providing, for the first time, a robust evidence that a dinoflagellate can occupy climatically distinct niche spaces following its introduction into new areas. This is probably mirroring the lack of adequate management to deal with various impacts on drainage basins, such as ongoing accelerated cultural eutrophication coupled with river impoundments and water diversion. Thus, this framework provides helpful insights on how to optimize our ability to anticipate invasions and to avoid ecosystem services losses, as well as future studies prospects on adaptive mechanisms of this pervasive invader.},

To investigate the impact of predatory fish on populations of this mussel, and the effects of this top-down interaction on native macroinvertebrates, we performed an in situ experiment in the Uruguay River. By comparing benthic communities of artificial substrates colonised in treatments allowing or excluding fish access, it was demonstrated that fish significantly reduce colonisation by L. fortunei (i.e. its density, biomass and body size). In the absence of mussels (before settlement), fish preyed upon the native macroinvertebrate community inhabiting artificial substrates, reducing their densities compared to the fish exclusion treatment. However, it was found that in the presence of golden mussel (after settlement), the total density of benthic macroinvertebrates, densities of scrapers, and densities of dipterans and gastropods strongly decreased in fish exclusion treatments, suggesting a strong effect of L. fortunei in reducing the native fauna. By preying on L. fortunei, fish favoured the persistence of native macroinvertebrates. Further studies focused on predatory fish species and their efficiency in removing L. fortunei may contribute to advancing towards using native fish as mitigating agents.},

Many freshwater fish and plant invaders have been eliminated, especially by chemical and physical methods for fishes and herbicides for plants. Efforts to maintain invasive freshwater fishes at low levels have sometimes succeeded, although continuing the effort has proven challenging. By contrast, successful maintenance management of invasive freshwater plants is uncommon, although populations of several species have been managed by biological control. Invasive crayfish populations have rarely been controlled for long. Marine invasions have proven far less tractable than those in fresh water, with a few striking eradications of species detected before they had spread widely, and no marine invasions have been substantially managed for long at low levels. The rapid development of technologies based on genetics has engendered excitement about possibly eradicating or controlling terrestrial invaders, and such technologies may also prove useful for certain aquatic invaders.

Together with ovoviviparity and the ability to reproduce parthenogenetically while being released from parasite pressure, the ability to adapt readily to a wide range of habitat conditions is likely paramount for the invasive success of P. antipodarum.},

We found two main patterns in the distribution of suitable areas for golden and zebra mussels. First, the distribution of potentially suitable areas, both in present and future scenarios, is different between mussel species: zebra mussel has areas that are more suitable in temperate regions, while suitable areas for golden mussel are concentrated in tropical and subtropical regions. Second, suitable habitats for golden mussel will increase more in future global warming scenarios compared to suitable habitats for zebra mussel. Indeed, there are experimental indications that zebra mussel has a lower tolerance to high temperatures compared to golden mussel, which is in agreement with our findings. We recommend that the future monitoring of both golden and zebra mussels in the New World should consider areas of highest thermic suitability for current and future scenarios.},

title={Towards global dominance of invasive alien plants in freshwater ecosystems: the dawn of the Exocene?},
abstract={The global and seemingly unstoppable spread of invasive alien plants emerges as one of the main topics of current science. This is due to the multiple repercussions of invasive plants on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, plus huge consequences on human existence. In freshwaters, lots of invaders are extremely competitive by virtue of their idiosyncratic reproductive and adaptive strategies. As â€œinland islandsâ€, freshwaters seem particularly prone to changes when invaded, such as reorganisation of food webs and biotic interactions. Together, these events are self-reinforcing, implying hardly reversible hysteric phenomena. The intention of this paper is to point out: invasion pathways, driving factors, invasion mechanisms, and noticeable effects mediated by plant invaders in freshwaters through an extensive knowledge review. The growing evidence suggests the dawn of a new epochal phase: a globally alien-dominated â€œbio-historical horizonâ€, tentatively called â€œExoceneâ€, where invaders play predominant roles that drive freshwaters functioning and successional unexpected stages. In the context of invasion science, Exocene reinforces the need for an ecosystem-based perspective to properly understand the implications of plant invaders in freshwaters. Seven challenging issues emerge to be addressed to better outline the global paths of biodiversity and functioning between biomes when faced with biological invasion.},

abstract={Seagrass beds are important habitats in coastal areas but increasingly decline in area and quality, thus conservation measures are urgently needed. Quantitative food webs, describing the biomass distribution and energy fluxes among trophic groups, reveal structural and functional aspects of ecosystems. Their knowledge can improve ecological conservation. For the recently discovered large warm-temperate seagrass (Zostera japonica) habitat in China<e2><80><99>s Yellow River Delta wetland, we used <ce><b4>13C and <ce><b4>15N measurements and a Bayesian isotope mixing model to construct its food web diagram with quantitative estimations of consumer diet compositions, comprising detritus and 14 living trophic groups from primary producers to fish. We then estimated the quantitative food web fluxes based on biomass measurements and calculated corresponding ecosystem functions. Pelagic producers were significantly 13C-depleted compared to benthic sources. Consumers (except zooplankton) were increasingly 13C-depleted with increasing trophic positions even though the consumed benthic production surpassed the pelagic one. Bivalves dominated consumer biomasses and fluxes and were the first to connect the pelagic and benthic pathways, whereas zooplankton and gastropods were specialized on the two pathways, respectively. We found flat biomass and production pyramids indicating low trophic transfer efficiencies. Generally, the energetic structure of the quantitative food web was consistent with the stable isotope analysis, and the estimated net primary production and most estimated production to biomass ratios of the trophic groups fell within literature ranges. This study provides a systematical understanding of the quantitative trophic ecology of a seagrass bed and facilitates synergistic knowledge on management, conservation, and restoration.},

title={Influence of Environmental Stressors on the Microbiota of Zebra Mussels (<i>Dreissena polymorpha</i>)},
abstract={Host-associated microbiota play a critical role in host fitness by providing nutrition, enhancing digestion capabilities, and by providing protection from pathogens. Here, we investigated the effects of two environmental stressors, temperature, and salinity, on the microbiota associated with zebra mussels (ZMs), a highly invasive bivalve in North America. To examine this in detail, lake-collected ZMs were acclimated to laboratory conditions, and subjected to temperature and salinity stress conditions. The impact of these stressors on the diversity, composition, and dynamics of ZM-associated microbiota were assessed by using amplicon- and shotgun-based sequencing, and qPCR-based approaches. Elevated temperature was found to be the primary driver of ZM mortality, although salinity alone also increased its likelihood. Stressor-induced ZM mortality, which ranged between 53 and 100%, was concomitant with significant increases in the relative abundance of several genera of putative opportunistic pathogens including Aeromonas. These genera were only present in low relative abundance in ZMs obtained from the control tank with 0% mortality. Shotgun sequencing and qPCR analyses indicated that the relative and absolute abundances of pathogenic Aeromonas species (particularly A. veronii) were significantly greater in temperature-induced dead ZMs. Taken together, our results show that environmental stress, especially elevated temperature (> 25 <c2><b0>C), is associated with the rapid mortality of ZMs as well as the proliferation of putative opportunistic bacterial pathogens.},

title={Methodology for flushing pressurised irrigation networks for fertigation and operation maintenance purposes},
abstract={Pressurised irrigation networks with a certain degree of automation allow centralized fertigation and maintenance operations such as cleaning subunits and preventing the proliferation of invasive species such as zebra mussels. Until now, there is no methodology that guarantees the total cleaning of the network of a substance in the shortest possible time. In the same way, it does not exist to guarantee reaching all consumption points with a certain concentration of a substance, injecting the minimum possible amount. For that purpose, a general novel methodology has been developed that makes use of the network<e2><80><99>s hydraulic model and parallel multi-objective genetic algorithms to flush the network of a certain substance or to get it to all consumption points in the shortest possible time and supplying a minimum volume. This method assumes that the available pressure at the source is always over a minimum value. The arrival times to the consumption points are minimized and the injected volume is reduced to the minimum of replacement, that is, the volume of the network pipes. The methodology applied to the study case allowed the entire network to be flushed in a minimum time of 2.46<c2><a0>h. On a normal irrigation day, without making any changes to the irrigation schedule the time to completely flush the network is 11.76<c2><a0>h. Furthermore, the injected volume differs greatly from the total volume of the pipes.},

title={Identifying the influence of zebra and quagga mussels on sedimentary phosphorus dynamics in western Lake Erie},
abstract={Dreissenid mussels can alter nutrient cycling and algal productivity in many freshwater ecosystems. But their effects on sedimentary phosphorus dynamics remain largely undefined. Here, we report evidence that dreissenids affect the concentrations of five sedimentary phosphorus fractions and total phosphorus. During our study, zebra mussels were still common and coexisted with quagga mussels in many parts of the basin. The relative abundances varied across the basin, which we characterized as five west-to-east alternating zones where zebra mussels dominated zones I (coastal) and III, quagga mussels dominated zones II and IV, and few dreissenids were present in zone V. The phosphorus fractions exhibited variation concordant with and therefore potentially influenced by dreissenids. Concentrations of all fractions and TP were consistently greater in sediments where quagga mussels dominated than in sediments where zebra mussels dominated. The responses to the absence versus presence of dreissenids were mixed, with Res-P being significantly affected, NaCl-Pi and HCl-Pi being moderately affected, and NaOH-Pi being least affected. Although such dreissenid effects were somewhat altered by in-lake biogeochemical cycling and transfer, we found that elevated levels of NaCl-Pi in dreissenid-present sediments, especially in quagga-dominated sediments, could be linked to recent eutrophication and harmful algal blooms in the basin.},

abstract={While organic and inorganic nutrient inputs from land are recognized as a major driver of primary production in estuaries, remarkably little is known about how processes within the tidal freshwater zones (TFZs) of rivers modify these inputs. This study quantifies organic matter (OM) decomposition rates in surface sediment layers in the lower reaches of two south Texas river channels and identifies key parameters that influence sediment decomposition rates. Sediment cores were collected from non-tidal and tidal freshwater sites in the Mission and Aransas rivers during two summers (June 2015 and June 2016) and two winters (February 2016, January 2017). We measured oxygen consumption rates, organic carbon and nitrogen content, stable isotope ratios (<ce><b4>13C and <ce><b4>15N of OM), and sediment porosity. O2 consumption rates in TFZ sediments were 385<e2><80><89><c2><b1><e2><80><89>88<c2><a0><ce><bc>mol O2 m<e2><88><92>2<c2><a0>h<e2><88><92>1 (summer) and 349<e2><80><89><c2><b1><e2><80><89>87<c2><a0><ce><bc>mol O2 m<e2><88><92>2<c2><a0>h<e2><88><92>1 (winter) in the Aransas River and 767<e2><80><89><c2><b1><e2><80><89>153<c2><a0><ce><bc>mol O2 m<e2><88><92>2<c2><a0>h<e2><88><92>1 (summer) and 691<e2><80><89><c2><b1><e2><80><89>95<c2><a0><ce><bc>mol O2 m<e2><88><92>2<c2><a0>h<e2><88><92>1 (winter) in the Mission River. These rates in TFZs were similar to rates in estuaries and higher than rates at non-tidal riverine sites. Rates of sediment O2 consumption were primarily controlled by OM content and temperature. Sediment OM was dominated by algal biomass from in situ production in both TFZs. We hypothesize that algal production and sinking within TFZs is a major pathway for translocation of watershed-derived nutrients from the water column to the sediments within TFZs. Further work is needed to quantify linkages between decomposition, nutrient remineralization, and potential removal through processes such as denitrification.},

abstract={Species interactions may mediate the ability of organisms and communities to provide valued services but are rarely considered in forecasting how service provisioning will change as restored communities mature and change in species composition. Bivalves are foundational species in many communities that contribute to services such as habitat provisioning, water filtration, and denitrification but that also may respond to predator presence by reducing activity. Filtering and biodeposition rates of ribbed mussels (Geukensia demissa) in the presence of predators (blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus), oyster drills (Urosalpinx cinerea)), injured conspecifics, or other local species (mud snails, Tritia obsoleta) were compared in laboratory experiments conducted in July<e2><80><93>August 2019 in the Hudson River estuary (New York, USA). The effect of predator diet on ribbed mussel responses was also considered. Although mussels tended to be less active in the presence of predators and injured conspecifics, significant decreases were observed in few traits, and there was no evidence that predator diet influenced mussel responses. Variability in feeding rates and other factors such as water quality may play a larger role than predator presence in determining mussel activity. These results suggest that G. demissa will continue to provide positive impacts on water clarity and quality and increase denitrification rates via biodeposition even as restored communities attract predators.},

We hypothesized that settled blooms may increase redox-dependent P release and unbalance the stoichiometry of benthic nutrient regeneration (NH4+:SiO2:PO43<e2><88><92> ratios). We tested this hypothesis in the hypertrophic Curonian Lagoon, the largest in Europe. During summer, at peak chlorophyll and water temperatures, sediment cores were collected over 19 stations representing all the lagoon sedimentary environments. Sediment organic content, granulometry, aerobic respiration, and oxic and anoxic fluxes of dissolved inorganic nutrients and metals<e2><80><94>Fe2+ and Mn2+<e2><80><94>were measured. Loads and stoichiometry of regenerated nutrients were compared with those from the watershed. Analyzed sediments had elevated oxygen demand (<e2><88><92>1.90 to <e2><88><92>5.66<c2><a0>mmol O2 m<e2><88><92>2<c2><a0>h<e2><88><92>1), generally uncoupled to their variable organic matter content (1<e2><80><93>23%) and median particle size (30<e2><80><93>300<c2><a0><ce><bc>m). Under oxic conditions, summer internal recycling equaled (SiO2) or exceeded, by a factor of ~66 and ~<e2><80><89>2, external loads of NH4+ and PO43<e2><88><92>, respectively. Transient anoxia produced a general decrease of NH4+ and SiO2 regeneration, likely due to decreased macrofauna activity or inefficient mineralization, whereas it doubled average PO43<e2><88><92> fluxes. In sandy, well-flushed areas, anoxia had a minor effect on PO43<e2><88><92>, but stimulated a large production of Mn2+. Muddy sediments in lagoon areas with slow water renewal displayed large redox-dependent PO43<e2><88><92> mobility, coupled to Fe2+ release. Settled algal blooms and hypoxic conditions might unbalance benthic regeneration stoichiometry and sustain blooms. The sedimentary pool of Mn4+ may represent a natural buffer preventing iron reduction and PO43<e2><88><92> mobility.},

We discuss marine conservation issues in the light of life cycle aspects and conclude that eDNA can improve our ecological knowledge in some instances, for example, in tracking migration patterns. We also illustrate and discuss the application of eDNA analysis within the context of population genetics, epigenetics, geochemistry and oceanography. Embedded into an interdisciplinary context, eDNA can be exploited by a huge variety of methodological techniques, and can resolve spatio-temporal patterns of diversity, species, or even populations within ecological, evolutionary, and management frameworks.},

abstract={The ecological consequences of biological range extensions reflect the interplay between the functional characteristics of the newly arrived species and their recipient ecosystems. Teasing apart the relative contribution of each component is difficult because most colonization events are studied retrospectively, i.e., after a species became established and its consequences apparent. We conducted a prospective experiment to study the ecosystem consequences of a consumer introduction, using whole-stream metabolism as our integrator of ecosystem activity. In four Trinidadian streams, we extended the range of a native fish, the guppy (Poecilia reticulata), by introducing it over barrier waterfalls that historically excluded it from these upper reaches. To assess the context dependence of these range extensions, we thinned the riparian forest canopy on two of these streams to increase benthic algal biomass and productivity. Guppy<e2><80><99>s range extension into upper stream reaches significantly impacted stream metabolism but the effects depended upon the specific stream into which they had been introduced. Generally, increases in guppy biomass caused an increase in gross primary production (GPP) and community respiration (CR). The effects guppies had on GPP were similar to those induced by increased light level and were larger in strength than the effects stream stage had on CR. These results, combined with results from prior experiments, contribute to our growing understanding of how consumers impact stream ecosystem function when they expand their range into novel habitats. Further study will reveal whether local adaptation, known to occur rapidly in these guppy populations, modifies the ecological consequences of this species introduction.},

title={Hydrodynamic interactions with coral topography and its impact on larval settlement},
abstract={Many benthic larvae rely on ambient flow and turbulence for their dispersal to settlement sites. After reaching the seafloor, larvae must prevent predation as well as overcome flow forces which act to dislodge them in order to achieve successful settlement. Most oceanic benthic habitats are topographically complex and are characterized by a combination of tidally driven currents and wave-driven oscillatory flows, which can exert substantial forces along settlement surfaces. In this study, computational fluid dynamics was used to numerically model both wave-dominated and unidirectional flows over surfaces of varying topography designed to mimic the surface roughness of corals. Near-surface hydrodynamic parameters, including velocities, turbulence statistics, and surface shear stresses, were computed, along with forces on simulated larvae settled on surfaces. It was found that widely spaced surface roughness (characterized as a k-type roughness with roughness width/height<e2><80><89>><e2><80><89>1) yielded 50<e2><80><93>100% higher surface shear stress than tightly spaced roughness (characterized as d-type with width/height<e2><80><89><<e2><80><89>1), owing to eddy vortex ejection from k-type topographies. Results also found that a larva experiences up to two orders of magnitude greater mean fluid forces when settled on top of a roughness element rather than between roughness elements. Maximum drag and lift forces on a larva were two to three times greater in wave conditions compared to unidirectional flows. Our findings demonstrate that larvae have a higher probability to remain attached to surfaces when in less wavy environments and sheltered within coral crevices of d-type roughness.},

Exposure to the highest-concentration ionic treatments (500 and 1000<e2><80><89>mg<e2><80><89>kg<e2><88><92>1) caused 100% mortality, while for other treatments, mortality did not exceed 15% at the end of exposure.

ZnO-NPs and ZnCl2 caused different responses at medium Zn concentrations (250 and 500<e2><80><89>mg<e2><80><89>kg<e2><88><92>1): earthworms exposed to ionic treatment at 250<e2><80><89>mg<e2><80><89>kg<e2><88><92>1 were characterized by a significantly lower growth constant, lower cellular respiration rate, later inflection point, and higher final body weight than those exposed to ZnO-NPs treatments at the same (250<e2><80><89>mg<e2><80><89>kg<e2><88><92>1) or twice as high (500<e2><80><89>mg<e2><80><89>kg<e2><88><92>1) nominal Zn concentrations. However, differences were not observed in all examined parameters between the studied forms when the highest-concentration ZnO-NPs treatment was compared with the lowest-concentration ionic treatment, which was likely due to the same levels of available Zn concentrations in those treatments. Overall, different growth and maturation strategies accompanied by pronounced differences in cellular respiration were adopted by earthworms exposed to low and medium levels of either ZnO-NPs or ZnCl2.},

However, interrelationships between copepod and cyanobacterial population dynamics and ecophysiology remain unclear. Insights into these relationships are important to aquatic resource management, as they may help guide mitigation efforts. We developed a calanoid copepod qPCR assay to investigate how copepod abundance and physiological status relate to the abundance of cyanobacteria and the concentration of total microcystin in a HAB-prone freshwater multi-use eutrophic lake. Through in silico and in vitro validation of primers and analyses of time series, we demonstrate that our assay can be used as a reliable tool for environmental monitoring. Importantly, copepod RNA:DNA ratios on and shortly after the day when microcystin concentration was at its highest within the lake were not significantly lower (or higher) than before or after this period, suggesting that copepods may have been tolerant of microcystin levels observed and capable of perpetuating bloom events by consuming competitors of toxic cyanobacteria.},

abstract={In Europe, large rivers have been greatly impacted by engineering and hydraulic works. The Upper Rhine channelization has notably led to a disconnection between the main channel and its floodplain and side channels. Between 1998 and 2006, unprecedented restoration projects led to the reconnection of nine Rhine side channels to the main channel or the Rhine Drainage Canal. The structures of recolonizing macroinvertebrate communities observed in the restored side channels, either in 2009 or 2010, were compared to the ones of three reference side channels. The aims of the study were (i) to analyze the recolonizing macroinvertebrate communities and (ii) to identify the drivers of the community structure. The restored side channels exhibited macroinvertebrate community structures similar to those of the reference side channels. These communities were characterized by a high abundance of nonnative and invasive taxa and a structure not linked to either the time since restoration or the water and sediment chemistry. Significant correlations existed between the macroinvertebrate community structures and the mosaics of habitats, driven by the variations in side channel morphometry and discharge. Therefore, the diversity of habitat characteristics of the side channels might help conserve and increase macroinvertebrate biodiversity at the floodplain scale.},

abstract={Perna viridis Linnaeus (1758) is a major foulant in the cooling water systems of electric power stations located on the East coast of India. Though chlorination is considered an effective fouling control measure, the strategy may fail in the case of bivalve mussels, due to the ability of the mussels to close their shells and still survive for extended periods of time. In a given power station, continuous low dose (exomotive) chlorination (0.2<c2><a0><c2><b1><c2><a0>0.1<c2><a0>mg<c2><a0>l<e2><88><92>1) is practiced to control biofouling. Laboratory experiments were carried out to assess the mortality and valve movement response of Perna viridis exposed to chlorine, using a Mosselmonitor<c2><ae>. All size groups tested showed progressive reduction in valve opening upon chlorination. However, continuous dosing of chlorine concentration as high as 1.0<c2><a0>mg<c2><a0>l<e2><88><92>1 was required for sustained and complete valve closure response in this mussel. At lower concentration (0.7<c2><a0>mg<c2><a0>l<e2><88><92>1), the mussels were able to open their shells and feed. Sustained valve closure resulted in physiological stress to the mussels due to reduced feeding, subsequently leading to death. Time to 100% mortality was dependent on the size of the mussels. At 1.0<c2><a0>mg<c2><a0>l<e2><88><92>1 chlorine residual, smaller size group (30<e2><80><93>50<c2><a0>mm) mussels showed 100% mortality in 79.3<c2><a0>h, while larger groups (50<e2><80><93>70<c2><a0>mm and 70<e2><80><93>90<c2><a0>mm) took 152<c2><a0>h and 243<c2><a0>h, respectively. Frequency of valve opening was high in smaller size group mussels (30<e2><80><93>50<c2><a0>mm), compared with larger groups (70<e2><80><93>90<c2><a0>mm). Even though the time taken for killing was size-dependent, frequency of valve opening and time period between successive openings were found to be characteristic of individual mussels. The observations provide new insight into the response of bivalve mussels to continuous chlorination in the context of biofouling control and point to the need to adopt pragmatic strategies to prevent mussel spat settlement rather than killing of adult mussels, thereby reducing environmental burden due to chlorine residuals. Usage of target-specific biocidal strategies (intermittent/pulse dosing) or alternative biocides (chlorine dioxide) may help mitigate green mussel fouling in tropical cooling water systems.},

Lake Manasbal is only true warm monomictic urban lake in Kashmir and remains thermally stratified for 8<e2><80><93>9 months, with separate layers of epilimnion, metalimnion and hypolimnion.We noticed that in the lower part of the hypolimnion, the process of stratification is characterized by an oxygen deficit (O2 < 1 mg/L). The rate of oxygen depletion reported in the lake<e2><80><99>s bottom layers is indicative of the water body<e2><80><99>s more eutrophic nature. A clinograde type of pH curve with a wide range of fluctuation from top to bottom layers of water was observed. Thermal stratification of the lake allows ammonium and phosphates to pool in the hypolimnion for much of the stratification period, resulting in concentrations higher than in the epilimnion. Consequently, the lake was characterized by a nutrient-enriched hypolimnion and an epilimnion deprived of nutrients. With the advent of the lake stratification, the thermocline was formed on 15th March between 2 and 3 m and on 7th April between 4 and 6 m, which gradually moved down to 10 m on 4th July and remained at that depth until circulation. The concentration of phosphorus and nitrogen in Lake Manasbal showed an increase towards the bottom, thus revealing an inverse clinograde depth distribution. Due to stratification phenomena in this lake, the internal release and subsequent distribution of nutrients throughout water column especially phosphorus from sediment water interface after mixing is a cause of concern for management authorities as it has the potential to diminish the ecological and aesthetics of the lake.Therefore, we argue that this study will provide some valuable insights on how stratification is affecting the nutrient dynamics and will offer inputs for better management accordingly both from ecological and economic perspectives.},

title={The unreliable concept of native range as applied to the distribution of the rusty crayfish (<i>Faxonius rusticus</i>) in North America},
abstract={The concept of native range in invasion biology is difficult to define since, in many cases, this type of range is unknown and cannot be determined. We investigate the uncertainties related to this concept by focusing on the distribution of Faxonius rusticus (Girard, 1852), also known as the rusty crayfish, which is perceived as possibly the worst invasive crayfish species in North America. In this study, we undertake a comprehensive literature review, which includes 430 studies published between 1852 and 2018, in order to analyze the native and introduced ranges of this species. The rusty crayfish was reported to occur in 33 states in the U.S.A. and 3 Canadian Provinces. Ten of these U.S. states and one Canadian Province have been included multiple times in both the native and the non-native ranges of this crayfish. The confusion regarding the limits and history of the native range of the rusty crayfish has implications for the conservation of this species in various jurisdictions. This review also demonstrates that even for intensely studied species perceived as invasive, we often do not have a clear understanding of essential concepts such as native and non-native range.},

title={Spatial and temporal dynamics of fish assemblages in a desert reservoir over 38Â years},
abstract={Processes associated with reservoir aging threaten the capacity of systems to continue providing productive fisheries, and declining productivity might be exacerbated by decreasing water level associated with climate change and water abstraction. Despite their prevalence in riverscapes, we know little about long-term fish dynamics in reservoirs. Using a 38-year dataset from Lake Powell, USA, we tested for changes in assemblage structure and changes in fish condition for the most abundant species. The assemblage has undergone re-ordering of species relative abundance, but the same core species captured in 1981 were still present in 2018. Five species increased in relative abundance, while two declined, and seven remained unchanged. Walleye Sander vitreus and Smallmouth Bass Micropterus dolomieu were among those increasing over time, while Channel Catfish Ictalurus punctatus and Common Carp Cyprinus carpio declined. We were not able to attribute changes in fish assemblages with a suite of abiotic and biotic variables. Condition was low and declined over time for four of the six species. Although water level declined over time, we did not observe obvious declines in basal food resources. Declining water level has reduced availability of littoral habitat and likely contributed to declines in some species associated with this zone.},

title={Characteristics of native predators are more important than those of alien prey in determining the success of biotic resistance in marine systems},
abstract={Predator-driven biotic resistance is known to be more effective in marine systems than in terrestrial and freshwater environments. However, there is little consensus about when such resistance can be expected to succeed or fail. Here, we reviewed case studies that investigated interactions between native marine predators and alien prey, with the aim of establishing which characteristics are important in determining the outcome of such interactions. Four potential biotic resistance outcome scenarios were identified, with these scenarios progressing from a state of no resistance to successful resistance, i.e. when an alien species is successfully excluded from the native community. Characteristics of native predators and alien prey that likely affect the outcome of biotic resistance were identified, and their presence and absence were noted for each case study. The outcome of each native predator<e2><80><93>alien prey interaction was assigned to one of the four biotic resistance outcome scenarios, based on the conclusion of the original study. Multivariate statistics were used to examine potential differences in the suites of characteristics typifying each outcome scenario. These characteristics were found to differ significantly among scenarios, with failure of predator-driven biotic resistance occurring in cases where the alien prey typically had high fecundity, high recruitment and substantial dispersal potential. Conversely, successful biotic resistance was related to the characteristics of native predators including high abundance, strong predation pressure on alien prey, coupled with high feeding rates. This research emphasises the need to integrate information from both trophic groups to strengthen predictions about the outcomes of novel predator<e2><80><93>prey interactions.},

Water concentrations based on PSD were compared with spot water samples collected at 0, 15, 32, and 63 days of exposition. PCBs and metals displayed linear accumulation kinetics both in PSDs and bivalves, but with different slopes. PCBs slopes were 2<e2><80><93>27 times higher in bivalves (0.3<e2><80><93>7.9 vs. 0.1<e2><80><93>2.6 ng g<e2><88><92>1 d<e2><88><92>1 in PSDs) reflecting active filtration and uptake from particles, colloids, and dissolved phase, whereas metal slopes were 2.5<e2><80><93>11 times lower in bivalves (0.04<e2><80><93>0.18 vs. 0.10<e2><80><93>2.00 <ce><bc>g g<e2><88><92>1 d<e2><88><92>1 in PSDs) suggesting metal bioregulation.

On the other hand, PSD-dissolved Mn concentrations (49<c2><b1>38 <ce><bc>g l<e2><88><92>1) were higher (p<0.05) than those from spot water samples (7<c2><b1>11<ce><bc>g l<e2><88><92>1) possibly due to phase changes of Mn distribution related to variable redox conditions in the water.

title={Long-term primary production trends in the Laurentian Great Lakes: a comparison of geochemical methods},
abstract={Sediment cores from 12 locations throughout the Laurentian Great Lakes basin were analyzed for geochemical indicators of primary production. Sediment analytes included organic and inorganic contents, carbonates, sediment accumulation rates, total organic carbon and nitrogen concentrations, carbon and nitrogen isotope composition, and trends in spectroscopically inferred chlorophyll a (and its main diagenetic products). When multiple indicators were considered, production records related to recent cultural eutrophication and catchment activities were clear in the paleorecords. Indicators derived from loss-on-ignition (organic and inorganic content) were strongly associated with periods of human settlement in the catchments that increased overall sediment loads to the lakes. The ratio of carbon to nitrogen tracked catchment inputs of carbon, especially during periods of watershed development in western Lake Superior. Sediment records such as chlorophyll a and <ce><b4>13Corg appear to be reliable indicators of trends in past algal abundance, particularly in Lake Erie, which has a well-known history of higher production and cultural eutrophication. These analytes also correlated well with past measured water quality surrogates for lake primary productivity and stressor data such as human populations in adjacent watersheds. A comparison among indicators revealed that several show redundancy as good proxies of production or productivity, though context was important. For instance, heavier isotopes of carbon and nitrogen are often prescribed as sedimentary indicators of lake productivity, but these two analytes were negatively correlated in Lake Superior, possibly due to long-term increases in cyanobacteria or changes in the nitrogen source. An increase in sediment carbonates can indicate summer blooms of cyanobacteria (a phenomenon that was clearly apparent in Lake Ontario) or catchment erosion. To make convincing geochemical inferences of primary production in the Great Lakes, it is recommended that a weight of evidence be built through the use of multiple indicators.},

title={The Importance of Marine Bivalves in Invasive Hostâ€“Parasite Introductions},
abstract={Although research into the ecology and impacts of invasive species is prevalent, there are knowledge gaps relating to the role of invasive species in parasite transmission. This work synthesises invasive host-parasite interactions and impacts, using marine bivalves as a model group, to consider how global movement of shellfish consignments for aquaculture purposes facilitates the unintentional transfer of invasives. We discuss how invasive species can act as both hosts or parasitic organisms themselves, and introductions may lead to diseases within the bivalve aquaculture sector. This review highlights the importance of interdisciplinary research, with particular regard to the fields of parasitology and invasion ecology. We suggest that further integrating these fields will enhance critical knowledge of marine diseases, parasite-invasive-bivalve interplay dynamics, and potential mitigation strategies, including temperature-based disease surveillance models. We also address how climate change might impact invasive species, again with a focus on marine bivalves, and the potential outcomes for parasite transmission, including changes in host/parasite distribution, life-history and virulence. We acknowledge the importance of horizon scanning for future invasive host-parasite introductions and note that increased screening of invasive species, both in their native and invaded ranges, will provide clarity on invasion dynamics and potential impacts.},

title={Sex-specific plasticity in a trophic polymorphic aquatic predator: a modeling approach},
abstract={Phenotypic plasticity is common among animal taxa. While there are clearly limits and likely costs to plasticity, these costs are unknown for most organisms. Further, as plasticity is partially genetically determined, the potential magnitude of exhibited plasticity may vary among individuals. In addition to phenotypic plasticity, various animal taxa also display sexual size dimorphism, a feature ultimately thought to arise due to differential size-dependent fitness costs and benefits between sexes. We hypothesized that differential selection acting on males and females can indirectly select for unequal genetically defined plasticity potential between the sexes. We evaluate this possibility for Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis), a species that displays modest sexual size dimorphism and habitat-related morphological plasticity. Using 500-year simulations of an ecogenetic agent-based model, we demonstrate that genetically determined morphological plasticity potential may evolve differently for males and females, leading to greater realized morphological variation between habitats for one sex over the other. Genetically determined potential for plasticity evolved differently between sexes across (a) various sex-specific life-history differences and (b) a variety of assumed costs of plasticity acting on both growth and survival. Morphological analyses of Eurasian perch collected in situ were consistent with model predictions: realized morphological variation between habitats was greater for females than males. We suggest that due to sex-specific selective pressures, differences in male and female genetically defined potential for plasticity may be a common feature across organisms.},

Overall, clearance rates are highly variable especially in C. fluminea and presumably regulated by other untested factors suggesting high plasticity in filtration.},

Our aim was to verify the effects of different monoculture types on stream benthic macroinvertebrate and fish communities<e2><80><99> structure. We compared the environmental characteristics and these communities<e2><80><99> structure in four streams located in native vegetation areas and four in each of three monoculture types (sugarcane, citrus, and eucalyptus), all belonging to the Paranapanema River basin, Southeastern Brazil. We found lower pH and dissolved oxygen and higher total phosphorus and fine substrate values in monoculture streams and these variables were also related to the lower abundance of macroinvertebrate groups more sensitive to environmental impacts. However, we did not find differences in fish communities or in their relationship with the different environmental characteristics observed. We also did not observe differences between the monoculture types in all comparisons made, which demonstrate that these plantations, although have different cultivation characteristics, cause similar negative impacts in the streams. Our study demonstrates the physical and chemical impacts of monoculture development on stream headwater communities. Regulatory measures such as increased riparian vegetation and contour farming and terracing may be critical to protect and restore headwater streams from monoculture impacts.},

Responding to threats from invasive species to minimize impacts to ecosystems, communities, food security, and northern economies will necessitate extensive observations and monitoring, but resource managers often face decisions without having adequate data and resources at hand. Local observing programs such as citizen science and community-based monitoring programs present attractive methods for increasing observing capacity that span contributory and co-created approaches while raising awareness of an issue among stakeholders. While the co-created model has been widely applied and encouraged in the Arctic context, contributory citizen science programs offer an additional tool for addressing observing needs in the Arctic.

We discuss criteria for achieving ARIAS priority actions at the participant scale related to participants' motivation and participants' understanding of the value of their contributions, at the programmatic scale, for example promoting accessible, reciprocal, and transparent knowledge exchange, and at the policy and science scale where management action is data driven. The approach is aimed at successful integration of citizen science into Arctic policy making.

They represent environments with a great diversity of habitats and communities, high carbon sequestration capacity and a wide range of ecosystem services. In the Mediterranean, the largest coastal wetlands are found in deltaic areas like that of the Ebro River (Spain), which has a coastline length of approximately 50 km, occupying a total area of 325 km2. The Ebro Delta is included in different national and international frameworks for environmental conservation, despite which there are several risks that threaten it. The lack of sedimentary contributions due to the regulation of the Ebro riverbed (irrigation, reservoirs, and hydroelectric power generation) has caused erosion and the retreat of certain sections of its coastline. To this situation of sediment deficit must be added the threat posed by the effects of global change, such as the rise in sea level, the increase in temperature and in the frequency and intensity of storms. This study analyses the particularities of the coastal wetland of the Ebro Delta, identifying the main threats it faces, as well as possible adaptation and mitigation strategies to these changes.},

title={Status of Freshwater Mussels (Unionidae) in the French Creek Watershed, USA at the Onset of Invasion by Round Goby, <i>Neogobius melanostomus</i>},
abstract={Freshwater mussels are an imperiled group of organisms that are vital to aquatic ecosystems. Services performed by freshwater mussels, coupled with their use for biomonitoring, make them an invaluable asset. Neogobius melanostomus (Round Goby), a recently introduced invasive species to the French Creek watershed, was once restricted to the watershed of Lake Erie in Pennsylvania. The Round Goby<e2><80><99>s propensity to consume Dreissena polymorpha (Zebra Mussel) and Dreissena bugensis (Quagga Mussel) in their native habitat raises concerns about this recent introduction into Pennsylvania<e2><80><99>s Allegheny River watershed. Since the discovery of their introduction within the watershed, we have followed the range expansion and dispersal rate of Round Gobies, which makes this study unique. The objectives of this study were to quantify baseline data on the contemporary diversity and abundance of unionid mussels in the upper French Creek watershed, and to explore potential habitat factors that influence or limit the size of the mussel populations. We gathered baseline data on freshwater mussel diversity and abundances across eight sites in the French Creek watershed and examined substrate particle size and host availability as potential limiting factors of the freshwater mussel distribution. Freshwater mussel surveys were conducted during the summer months (July<e2><80><93>September) of 2017 using area-constrained surveys. Results showed a significant relationship between mussel diversity and substrate particle size (p < 0.05). From the data collected, we were able to calculate population estimates for the species found across the sample sites. Our results regarding the locations of native mussel populations and characteristics of their habitat provide the needed insight for establishing priority areas for the conservation of freshwater mussels, facilitating planning for protection, mitigation, and adaptation as the invasive Round Goby continues its spread.},

title={Genotoxicity of Polystyrene (PS) Microspheres in Short-Term Exposure to Gametes of the Sand Dollar <i>Scaphechinus mirabilis</i> (Agassiz, 1864) (Echinodermata, Echinoidea)},
abstract={Microplastic pollution appears to be one of the major environmental problems in the world today, and researchers have been paying special attention to the study of the impact of microplastics on biota. In this article, we studied the short-term effects of polystyrene micro-spheres on genome integrity using the gametes of the Scaphechinus mirabilis sand dollar with the comet assay method. This highly sensitive method allowed us to identify the level of genome damage in both gametes before and after short-term exposure to PS microparticles. It was shown that primary polystyrene microspheres at concentrations of 104, 105, and 106 particles/L had a genotoxic effect during short-term exposure to the sperm of the sand dollar S. mirabilis, which was expressed as a significant increase in sperm DNA damage. The highest percentage of DNA damage (more than 20%) was detected in spermatozoa exposed for 1 h in water containing 105 microspheres of plastic per 1 L. Additionally, at all concentrations of microplastic studied in the experiment, the genetic damage index (GDI) values in spermatozoa exceeded the control level. However, regardless of the level of DNA damage, spermatozoa retained the ability to fertilise eggs with up to 97% efficiency. We must acknowledge that the genotoxic property of microplastic against sperm to some extent predicts the development of long-term adverse effects of environmental significance.},

title={Designing the Next Generation of Condition Tracking and Early Warning Systems for Shellfish Aquaculture},
abstract={Early detection of environmental disturbances affecting shellfish stock condition is highly desirable for aquaculture activities. In this article, a new biophysical model-based early warning system (EWS) is described, that assesses bivalve stock condition by diagnosing signs of persistent physiological dysfunctioning. The biophysical model represents valve gape dynamics, controlled by active contractions of the adductor muscle countering the passive action of the hinge ligament; the dynamics combine continuous convergence to a steady-state interspersed with discrete closing events. A null simulation was introduced to describe undisturbed conditions. The diagnostic compares valve gape measurements and simulations. Indicators are inferred from the model parameters, and disturbances are assessed when their estimates deviate from their null distribution. Instead of focusing only on discrete events, our EWS exploits the complete observed dynamics within successive time intervals defined by the variation scales. When applied to a valvometry data series, collected in controlled conditions from scallops (Pecten maximus), the EWS indicated that one among four individuals exhibited signs its physiological condition was degrading. This was detected neither during experiments nor during the initial data analysis, suggesting the utility of an approach that quantifies physiological mechanisms underlying functional responses. Practical implementations of biological-EWS at farming sites are then discussed.},

title={Open Lake Phosphorus Forcing of <i>Cladophora</i> Growth: Modeling the Dual Challenge in Great Lakes Trophic State Management},
abstract={Stimulated by excess levels of phosphorus, the attached, filamentous green alga Cladophora grows to nuisance proportions in Lake Michigan, one of the Laurentian Great Lakes. While nearshore waters impacted by local sources of the nutrient continue to support nuisance conditions, offshore waters have undergone oligotrophication in response to reductions in phosphorus loading and benthification of phosphorus cycling by invasive dreissenid mussels. A concept termed the Dual Challenge recognizes that implementation of more stringent phosphorus-loading objectives (to control Cladophora in the nearshore) stands in conflict with a foreseen need to mitigate oligotrophication in the offshore (to sustain a healthy fishery). Attention to this nearshore<e2><80><93>offshore dynamic calls into play the role of cross-margin phosphorus transport in mediating both endmembers of the conflict. We applied a biophysical model simulating soluble reactive (SRP) and particulate (PP) phosphorus, mussel biokinetics, and cross-margin mass transport in addressing the Dual Challenge. Pre- and post-dreissenid monitoring results suggest that a reduction in offshore PP levels (food web nutrition) in excess of 40% (2.4 to 1.4 mgP<c2><b7>m<e2><88><92>3) has driven oligotrophication and attendant food web dysfunction. Yet, in the absence of local sources, model-predicted nearshore SRP levels remain at or below those required to prevent nuisance growth. These findings indicate that there is a margin of ~1 mgP<c2><b7>m<e2><88><92>3 over which offshore PP levels could be increased (to the benefit of the food web and the fishery) without hindering efforts to reduce nuisance algal growth through local source control.},

title={An Acoustic Treatment to Mitigate the Effects of the Apple Snail on Agriculture and Natural Ecosystems},
abstract={Global change is the origin of increased occurrence of disturbance events in natural communities, with biological invasions constituting a major threat to ecosystem integrity and functioning. The apple snail (Pomacea maculata) is a freshwater gastropod mollusk from South America. Considered one of the 100 most harmful invasive species in the world, due to its voracity, resistance, and high reproductive rate, it has become a global problem for wetland crops. In Catalonia, it has affected the rice fields of the Ebre Delta since 2010 with significant negative impact on the local economy. As a gastropod mollusc it possesses statocysts consisting of a pair of sacs, one located on each side of the foot, that contain multiple calcium carbonate statoconia. This study shows the first ultrastructural images of pathological changes in the sensory epithelium of the statocyst of apple snail adults with an increase in the severity of the lesions over time after exposure to low frequency sounds. Sound-induced damage to the statocyst could likely result in an inhibition of its vital functions resulting in a potential reduction in the survival ability of the apple snail and lead to an effective mitigation method for reducing damage to rice fields.},

abstract={UVs are important ingredients in common cosmetic products (e.g., sunscreens, hairsprays, soap). After their use, they can enter the aquatic ecosystem and negatively affect non-target aquatic organisms. The aim of our study was to evaluate acute embryotoxicity of selected organic UVs 2-phenylbenzimidazole-5-sulfonic acid (PBSA), ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate (EHMC), octocrylene (OC), 4-methylbenzylidene camphor (4-MBC) and benzophenone-3 (BP-3). The chemicals were tested both as a single substance and their mixtures. The types of mixtures were chosen as follows: the combination of OC and 4-MBC; the combination of PBSA, EHMC and BP-3 and the combination of all five UV filters. The embryotoxicity was evaluated using a modified method of the Fish Embryo Acute Toxicity Test-OECD guideline 236 and zebrafish (Danio rerio) was selected as a suitable fish model organism. The toxic effects were studied by assessing mortality, hatching and the occurrence of malformations at 24, 48, 72 and 96 h post fertilization. The obtained results indicate that especially the mixture of OC and 4-MBC presents a potential risk of embryotoxicity for zebrafish due to a significant increase in mortality, which was 41.7% in the experimental group exposed to 10 <ce><bc>g/L at 96 h post fertilization. Based on our results, the most effected sub-lethal endpoints were hatching and malformation (e.g., edema of pericard, bent spine, yolk edema), but with no statistically significant effect. These results differ within groups with single UVs and with their mixtures, suggesting the interaction of these substances when they are exposed together.},

title={The Utility of <i>Dreissena polymorpha</i> for Assessing the Viral Contamination of Rivers by Measuring the Accumulation of F-Specific RNA Bacteriophages},
abstract={River water that receives treated wastewater can be contaminated by pathogens including enteric viruses due to fecal pollution, which may represent an important public health hazard. There is a great diversity of enteric viruses and fecal bacteriophages, especially F-specific RNA bacteriophages (FRNAPHs), are commonly proposed as indicators of viral pollution due to a variety of characteristics such as their structural similarities to the main enteric viruses, their high concentrations in raw wastewater and their environmental survival rate, which is better than other cultivable enteric viruses. However, evaluating the viral contamination of water on the basis of FRNAPH concentration levels continues to present a challenge. This is because the quality of detection is strongly dependent on the quantity of viral particles, high spatio-temporal variabilities and the physico-chemical conditions of the water during sampling. To overcome these limitations, the present study aims to evaluate whether the bivalve mollusk Dreissena polymorpha (zebra mussel) could be considered a suitable experimental model for assessing the viral contamination of rivers. In order to determine this, the capacity of D. polymorpha to accumulate FRNAPHs and assimilate them into their soft tissue was studied. This provided a proof of concept for the use of D. polymorpha to evaluate the viral contamination of surface water. Two experiments were conducted: (1) an in situ experiment to confirm that zebra mussels naturally accumulated FRNAPHs and (2) a laboratory experiment to determine the accumulation and depuration kinetics of FRNAPHs in D. polymorpha tissue. The study highlights the capacity of the mussels to accumulate infectious FRNAPHs both on a laboratory scale under controlled conditions as well as in situ at different sites that are representative of different bodies of water. An analysis of the mussels<e2><80><99> soft tissue showed that they were capable of reflecting the water<e2><80><99>s contamination level very quickly (within less than 24 h). Moreover, the soft tissue retained the viral load much longer than the water due to a low depuration rate. The analysis of FRNAPH concentrations in mussels exposed in situ suggested that there were differences in contamination levels between sites. These preliminary results underline the potential utility of zebra mussels in assessing viral contamination by measuring the accumulation of FRNAPHs in their tissue. This may ultimately enable stakeholders to use zebra mussels as a means of monitoring viral pollution in surface water.},

Most EDS associated with increased aquatic plant abundance were categorized as cultural or economic. User perceptions of the ES and EDS associated with aquatic plants affected support for management (60% of respondents supported some form of management), and such information is important for informing environmental decision making.},

title={Decoupling salinity and carbonate chemistry: low calcium ion concentration rather than salinity limits calcification in Baltic Sea mussels},
abstract={The Baltic Sea has a salinity gradient decreasing from fully marine (> 25) in the west to below 7 in the central Baltic Proper. Habitat-forming and ecologically dominant mytilid mussels exhibit decreasing growth when salinity < 11; however, the mechanisms underlying reduced calcification rates in dilute seawater are not fully understood. Both [HCO3-] and [Ca2+] also decrease with salinity, challenging calcifying organisms through CaCO3 undersaturation (<ce><a9><e2><89><a4>1) and unfavourable ratios of calcification substrates ([Ca2+] and [HCO3-]) to the inhibitor (H+), expressed as the extended substrate<e2><80><93>inhibitor ratio (ESIR). This study combined in situ monitoring of three southwest Baltic mussel reefs with two laboratory experiments to assess how various environmental conditions and isolated abiotic factors (salinity, [Ca2+], [HCO3-] and pH) impact calcification in mytilid mussels along the Baltic salinity gradient. Laboratory experiments rearing juvenile Baltic Mytilus at a range of salinities (6, 11 and 16), HCO3- concentrations (300<e2><80><93>2100 <c2><b5>mol kg-1) and Ca2+ concentrations (0.5<e2><80><93>4 mmol kg-1) reveal that as individual factors, low [HCO3-], pH and salinity cannot explain low calcification rates in the Baltic Sea. Calcification rates are impeded when <ce><a9>aragonite <e2><89><a4> 1 or ESIR <e2><89><a4> 0.7 primarily due to [Ca2+] limitation which becomes relevant at a salinity of ca. 11 in the Baltic Sea. Field monitoring of carbonate chemistry and calcification rates suggest increased food availability may be able to mask the negative impacts of periodic sub-optimal carbonate chemistry, but not when seawater conditions are permanently adverse, as observed in two Baltic reefs at salinities < 11. Regional climate models predict a rapid desalination of the southwest and central Baltic over the next century and potentially a reduction in [Ca2+] which may shift the distribution of marine calcifiers westward. It is therefore vital to understand the mechanisms by which the ionic composition of seawater impacts bivalve calcification for better predicting the future of benthic Baltic ecosystems.},

Controls of cyanobacteria blooms are not comprehensively understood, and this adds to the uncertainty of model-based projections into the warming future of the Baltic Sea.

abstract={Background Microcystins are emerging marine biotoxins, produced by potentially toxic cyanobacteria. Their presence has been reported in aquatic animals in Greek freshwater, while data are few in marine environments. Since the climate change induces eutrophication and harmful algal blooms in coastal marine ecosystems affecting the public health, further research on microcystins<e2><80><99> presence in marine waters is required. The aim of this study was to examine the potential presence of microcystins in mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis in the largest farming areas in Thermaikos gulf, in Northern Greece, and to investigate their temporal and spatial distribution, adding to the knowledge of microcystins presence in Greek Mediterranean mussels. Results A 4-year microcystins<e2><80><99> assessment was conducted from 2013 to 2016, in farmed Mediterranean mussels M. galloprovincialis, in five sampling areas in Thermaikos gulf, in northern Greece, where the 90% of the Greek mussels<e2><80><99> farming activities is located. The isolation of potentially toxic cyanobacteria was confirmed by molecular methods. An initial screening was performed with a qualitative and quantitative direct monoclonal (DM) ELISA and results above 1 ng g<e2><88><92>1 were confirmed for the occurrence of the most common microcystins-RR, -LR and -YR, by Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC) coupled with a high- resolution mass spectrometer (HRMS) (Orbitrap analyzer). Microcystin-RR and microcystin-LR were detected, while the intensity of microcystin-YR was below the method detection limit. Most samples that exhibited concentrations above 1 ng g-1 were detected during the warm seasons of the year and especially in spring. Results indicated an overestimation of the ELISA method, since concentrations ranged between 0.70<e2><80><89><c2><b1><e2><80><89>0.15 ng g<e2><88><92>1 and 53.90<e2><80><89><c2><b1><e2><80><89>3.18 ng g<e2><88><92>1, while the confirmation denoted that the levels of microcystins were 6 to 22 times lower. Conclusions Microcystin-RR and microcystin-LR were detected for the first time in mussel M. galloprovincialis, harvested from farms in Thermaikos gulf, in Central Macedonia, Greece. Their presence was linked to potentially toxic cyanobacteria. Bioaccumulation was observed in digestive gland, while the concentrations in muscles were found extremely low. Samples with levels above 1 ng g<e2><88><92>1 were observed mostly during spring, confirming the seasonal distribution of microcystins. The comparison of the results by the ELISA and the LC-Orbitrap MS method indicated an overestimation of concentration by the ELISA method.},

abstract={Natural high proliferations of toxin-producing microorganisms in marine and freshwater environments result in dreadful consequences at the socioeconomically and environmental level due to water and seafood contamination. Monitoring programs and scientific evidence point to harmful algal blooms (HABs) increasing in frequency and intensity as a result of global climate alterations. Among marine toxins, the okadaic acid (OA) and the related dinophysistoxins (DTX) are the most frequently reported in EU waters, mainly in shellfish species. These toxins are responsible for human syndrome diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP). Fish, like other marine species, are also exposed to HABs and their toxins. However, reduced attention has been given to exposure, accumulation, and effects on fish of DSP toxins, such as OA. The present review intends to summarize the current knowledge of the impact of DSP toxins and to identify the main issues needing further research. From data reviewed in this work, it is clear that exposure of fish to DSP toxins causes a range of negative effects, from behavioral and morphological alterations to death. However, there is still much to be investigated about the ecological and food safety risks related to contamination of fish with DSP toxins.},

title={Lake thermal structure drives interannual variability in summer anoxia dynamics in a eutrophic lake over 37Â years},
abstract={The concentration of oxygen is fundamental to lake water quality and ecosystem functioning through its control over habitat availability for organisms, redox reactions, and recycling of organic material. In many eutrophic lakes, oxygen depletion in the bottom layer (hypolimnion) occurs annually during summer stratification. The temporal and spatial extent of summer hypolimnetic anoxia is determined by interactions between the lake and its external drivers (e.g., catchment characteristics, nutrient loads, meteorology) as well as internal feedback mechanisms (e.g., organic matter recycling, phytoplankton blooms). How these drivers interact to control the evolution of lake anoxia over decadal timescales will determine, in part, the future lake water quality. In this study, we used a vertical one-dimensional hydrodynamic<e2><80><93>ecological model<c2><a0>(GLM-AED2) coupled with a calibrated hydrological catchment model<c2><a0>(PIHM-Lake) to simulate the thermal and water quality dynamics of the eutrophic Lake Mendota<c2><a0>(USA) over a 37 year period. The calibration and validation of the lake model consisted of a global sensitivity evaluation as well as the application of an optimization algorithm to improve the fit between observed and simulated data. We calculated stability indices (Schmidt stability, Birgean work, stored internal heat), identified spring mixing and summer stratification periods, and quantified the energy required for stratification and mixing. To qualify which external and internal factors were most important in driving the interannual variation in summer anoxia, we applied a random-forest classifier and multiple linear regressions to modeled ecosystem variables (e.g., stratification onset and offset, ice duration, gross primary production). Lake Mendota exhibited prolonged hypolimnetic anoxia each summer, lasting between 50<e2><80><93>60 d. The summer heat budget, the timing of thermal stratification, and the gross primary production in the epilimnion prior to summer stratification were the most important predictors of the spatial and temporal extent of summer anoxia periods in Lake Mendota. Interannual variability in anoxia was largely driven by physical factors: earlier onset of thermal stratification in combination with a higher vertical stability strongly affected the duration and spatial extent of summer anoxia. A measured step change upward in summer anoxia in<c2><a0>2010 was unexplained by the GLM-AED2 model. Although the cause remains unknown, possible factors include invasion by the predacious zooplankton Bythotrephes longimanus. As the heat budget depended primarily on external meteorological conditions, the spatial and temporal extent of summer anoxia in Lake Mendota is likely to increase in the near future as a result of projected climate change in the region.},

Samples were collected close to the deepest part of the lakes to avoid the diverse benthic and littoral zones.

We determined which species occurred most frequently in the region, as well as the species that were characteristic of different trophic conditions. We also recorded the presence of eight cold-adapted species which some of them are considered as glacial relicts (e.g., Eurytemora lacustris, Heterocope appendiculata, Cyclops lacustris). Our research revealed potential glacial refugia for planktonic species in 14 lakes of NE Poland. Our study suggests that the presence of stenotherm species may be an excellent indicator of the ecological status of deep lakes and could be considered in lake monitoring programs. Furthermore, we did not find Bythotrephes longimanus which has been reported from Poland. Instead, we found that B. brevimanus was the most common representative of the genus in the study area.},

abstract={The monitoring of microplastics pollution in freshwater environments trails behind its practice in marine ecosystems. We evaluated the use of the invasive zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) as a potential bioindicator of microplastic litter in freshwater lakes. Samples were collected from three sites (Lovere, Costa Volpino, Castro) at the northern end of Lake Iseo (one of the major subalpine lakes in north Italy) and compared for water physicochemical parameters, biometrical features of zebra mussels, and microplastics items/specimens (color, shape, size, and chemical composition). We hypothesized that since a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) on the Oglio River discharges into this area of the lake, the microplastics in D.polymorpha could be measured and compared in samples from the three sites at different distances from the WWTP. There was no difference in the physicochemical water parameters and biometric features between the samples from the three sites, whereas there was a significant difference in items/specimen between the sites in decreasing order (mean <c2><b1> standard deviation): Costa Volpino (0.23 <c2><b1> 0.43) > Lovere (0.07 <c2><b1> 0.25) > Castro (0.03 <c2><b1> 0.18). The chi-square test showed a significant difference in shape, color, and chemical composition frequency in the samples from the three sites. The chemical composition of the microplastics was polyethylene terephthalate (45%), nylon (20%), polypropylene (20%), polyamide resin (10%), and polyvinyl chloride (5%). Our data show that the amount of microplastics the zebra mussel accumulated was greater the closer the sampling site to the WWTP.

title={Multi-Biomarker Responses of Asian Clam Corbicula fluminea (Bivalvia, Corbiculidea) to Cadmium and Microplastics Pollutants},
abstract={One of the most widespread aquatic organisms in the rivers and estuarine ecosystems, in the world, is Asian clam Corbiculafluminea. This clam, that can adapt to environmental changes, is an invasive species in several areas and it was adopted as a model for toxicity tests. This study evaluated the effects of the exposure to cadmium (Cd), to microplastics (MPs) and their mixtures on C. fluminea. The oxidative stress responses, lipid peroxidation (LPO), changes in the activity of energy-related enzymes and neurotoxicity were assessed on the gill, digestive gland and gonad. The results show that Cd, MPs and their mixtures cause oxidative stress, damage and neurotoxicity. The enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and the LPO levels could be chosen as biomarkers of Cd pollution. Exposure to MPs induced an increase in reduced/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) ratio and increased AChE activity. The combined exposure to Cd and MPs caused a synergetic effect in gill and gonad, while an antagonism response was recorded in the digestive gland. The results provide new insights for unveiling the biologic effects of heavy metal, microplastics and their mixtures on C. fluminea. Besides, we demonstrated that the Asian clam is a good bioindicator of microplastic pollution that can occur in aquatic environments.},

title={Management of the Phosphorusâ€“Cladophora Dynamic at a Site on Lake Ontario Using a Multi-Module Bioavailable P Model},
abstract={The filamentous green alga Cladophora grows to nuisance proportions in Lake Ontario. Stimulated by high phosphorus concentrations, nuisance growth results in the degradation of beaches and clogging of industrial water intakes with attendant loss of beneficial uses. We develop a multi-module bioavailable phosphorus model to examine the efficacy of phosphorus management strategies in mitigating nuisance algal growth. The model platform includes modules simulating hydrodynamics (FVCOM), phosphorus-phytoplankton dynamics (GEM) and Cladophora growth (GLCMv3). The model is applied along a 25 km stretch of the Lake Ontario nearshore, extending east from Toronto, ON and receiving effluent from three wastewater treatment plants. Simulation results identify the Duffin Creek wastewater treatment plant effluent as a driving force for nuisance conditions of Cladophora growth, as reflected in effluent bioavailable phosphorus concentrations and the dimensions of the plant<e2><80><99>s phosphorus footprint. Simulation results demonstrate that phosphorus removal by chemically enhanced secondary treatment is insufficient to provide relief from nuisance conditions. Tertiary treatment (chemically enhanced secondary treatment with ballasted flocculation) is shown to eliminate phosphorus-saturated conditions associated with the Duffin Creek wastewater treatment plant effluent, providing local relief from nuisance conditions. Management guidance presented here has wider application at sites along the highly urbanized Canadian nearshore of Lake Ontario.},

title={Adsorption characteristics of ammonium onto biochar from an aqueous solution},
abstract={Ammonium contamination in water is a major concern worldwide. This study focuses on the removal of ammonium from aqueous solution by batch adsorption experiments using biochar derived from a combination of various wood chips (spruce, pine, and fir). Adsorption characteristics of ammonium onto biochar were evaluated as a function of biochar dosages, initial concentrations of ammonium, contact time and pH. Results demonstrated that ammonium removal increased with the increase of biochar dosage. The percentage of ammonium removal reached a value of 80% at a biochar dosage of 100 g/L. Ammonium removal decreased by 15% with the increase of initial ammonium concentration by 50 mg/L. The optimum pH for ammonium removal was considered in the range from 6 to 8. Ammonium removal reached its stable value within 3 days. The maximum adsorption capacity of ammonium was 0.96 mg/g for 80 mg/L of initial ammonium concentration. The adsorption isotherm followed both the Langmuir and Freundich models for ammonium adsorption onto biochar. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy results indicated the presence of amine, amide and nitrile functional groups on the surface of biochar which could contribute to the adsorption of ammonium onto biochar. Thus, biochar derived from various wood chips showed the potential to remove ammonium from aqueous solution.},

abstract={â€œPhytoplanktonâ€ is a loosely defined functional term, indicating a group of organisms distributed into several taxonomic groups ranging from oxygenic photosynthetic bacteria to a number of eukaryotic classes included in protists. The range of specializations and adaptations of phytoplankton to a wide variety of environmental conditions is astounding. This demonstrates the susceptibility of highly different populations to react rapidly to environmental changes generated by natural stressors and anthropogenic impacts. The aim of this work is to critically review the state of the art of knowledge about the impact of anthropogenic stress factors on phytoplankton composition and structure. At present, the two most important environmental stressors are represented by climate change and eutrophication, which act globally and at regional/local scales, respectively. Along with effects mediated by many other legacy and emerging stressors (briefly reviewed), the effects of these two main changes have been analysed at different levels of phytoplankton organization, i.e. individuals, populations and communities. It is stressed that a better knowledge will be obtained by extending the focus of studies from organisms detectable by light microscopy to the whole range of protists and microbial populations detected with the use of â€œomicsâ€ technologies, including e.g. next generation sequencing and ecological metabolomics.},

title={What Colin Reynolds could tell us about nutrient limitation, N:P ratios and eutrophication control},
abstract={Colin Reynolds exquisitely consolidated our understanding of driving forces shaping phytoplankton communities and those setting the upper limit to biomass yield, with limitation typically shifting from light in winter to phosphorus in spring. Nonetheless, co-limitation is frequently postulated from enhanced growth responses to enrichments with both N and P or from N:P ranging around the Redfield ratio, concluding a need to reduce both N and P in order to mitigate eutrophication. Here, we review the current understanding of limitation through N and P and of co-limitation. We conclude that Reynolds is still correct: (i) Liebig<e2><80><99>s law of the minimum holds and reducing P is sufficient, provided concentrations achieved are low enough; (ii) analyses of nutrient limitation need to exclude evidently non-limiting situations, i.e. where soluble P exceeds 3<e2><80><93>10<c2><a0><c2><b5>g/l, dissolved N<c2><a0>exceeds<c2><a0>100<e2><80><93>130<c2><a0><c2><b5>g/l and total P and<c2><a0>N support high biomass levels with self-shading causing light limitation; (iii) additionally decreasing N to limiting concentrations may be useful in specific situations (e.g. shallow waterbodies with high internal P and pronounced denitrification); (iv) management decisions require local, situation-specific assessments. The value of research on stoichiometry and co-limitation lies in promoting our understanding of phytoplankton ecophysiology and community ecology.},

Here, we present genetic evidence of population connectivity and gene flow of L. fortunei propagules from Asia into South America, proposing the main invasion routes into South America. To achieve that we expanded the sampling effort to cover all occurrence points of L. fortunei in South America. We sequenced the mtDNA COI gene and genotyped eight microsatellite loci (ML), and we evaluated the genetic source of the recently introduced population in Sobradinho hydroelectric power plant reservoir in Northeast Brazil. Our results revealed that China is the main genetic source of propagules for the Sobradinho population. We also found COI haplotypes and ML genotypes unique to South American populations, demonstrating a bridgehead effect likely caused by local mutation, adaptation, and admixture patterns that are maintained by high levels of gene flow among them. However, two genetic barriers were also detected. We concluded that L. fortunei is a well-established invader and is still rapidly expanding in Brazil, and the Amazon hydrographic basin is under an alarming threat of invasion.},

Accumulation levels of PAHs in the biota were used to calculate biota<e2><80><93>sediment (or porewater) accumulation factors (BSAF (BPwAF)) and bioaccumulation factor (BAF). The lower molecular weight PAHs constitute major components (<e2><89><a5><e2><80><89>87% in each case) of PAH congener profiles. Bioaccumulation was greatest for PAHs with log Kow values between 5.0 and 5.6. However, the study did not show a good correlation between log Kow of individual PAH and the corresponding BSAFs/BPwAF for the biota. The study indicates that significantly greater (p<e2><80><89><<e2><80><89>0.05) BSAFs for <ce><a3>PAHs were observed in the three bottom dwellers than in fish muscle which suggests that the sediment-feeding behavior largely affected the extent of PAH bioaccumulation in the aquatic organisms. The calculated potency equivalent concentration (PEC) of total PAHs was above the recommended screening value (SV) in US EPA guidelines, suggesting great concern for human consumption. However, estimated excess cancer risk (ECR) induced by dietary exposure only suggests potential cancer risk. The study suggests urgent remediation of the river to safeguard public health.},

In this study, lethality, influences on body weight, embryonic development and histological changes in embryos of marbled crayfish (Procambarus virginalis) as well as noble crayfish (Astacus astacus) were investigated in response to their exposure to different concentrations of Diclofenac. Additionally, the suitability of marbled crayfish as a model organism for endemic freshwater crayfish was established when studying the effects of Diclofenac. For both species, lethal effects started at concentrations of 10.24 mg/L Diclofenac, weight was not affected, embryonic development slowed down from concentrations of 0.16 mg/L and histological changes were visible from concentrations of 0.64 mg/L. The similarity of LOEC (Lowest Observed Effect Concentrations) between the two species showed that marbled crayfish can serve as a model for native crayfish when investigating the effects of exposure to Diclofenac.},

abstract={Recent climate-driven, physico-chemical changes documented in aquatic systems throughout the world are expected to intensify in the future. Specifically, changes in key environmental attributes of aquatic systems, such as water quantity, clarity, temperatures, ice cover, seasonal flow regimes, external loading, and oxygen content, will undoubtedly have a broad set of direct and indirect ecological consequences. Some anticipated impacts may be similar across different aquatic ecosystems, while others may be system-specific. Here, we review the potential effects of climatic changes for different freshwater habitats within the state of Indiana, USA, a Midwestern state with diverse land and water features. Given this heterogeneity and that the state is among the southernmost states of the US Midwest, evaluation of freshwater habitats of Indiana provides a useful perspective on potential impacts of climate change. In our study, we first review expected or anticipated changes to physico-chemical and habitat conditions in wetlands, lotic systems, small glacial lakes and Lake Michigan. We then highlight anticipated responses of select aquatic biota to these changes. We describe how climatic changes may interact with other anthropogenic stressors affecting freshwater habitats and consider the potential for evolutionary adaptation of freshwater aquatic organisms to mediate any responses. Given anticipated changes, we suggest aquatic ecosystem managers take a precautionary approach broadly applicable in temperate regions to (a) conserve a diversity of aquatic habitats, (b) enhance species diversity and both inter- and intra-population genetic variation, and (c) limit stressors which may exacerbate the risk of decline for aquatic biota.},

A survey in peer-reviewed literature and Dutch grey-literature was performed to gain insight into the physical-, chemical- and biological in-lake interventions used to bring these waters towards their desired state. A critical overview is presented on efficacy of different measures to counteract cyanobacterial blooms directly via targeting the cyanobacteria or indirectly via reduction of nutrient availability. Many actions have no or limited effects on minimising cyanobacterial blooms (air-bubble- or oil screens, surface mixers, low-energy ultrasound, effective micro-organisms, fish introduction), while others are more effective, but may vary in longevity and costs (dams, excavation or dredging, hydrogen peroxide, phosphorus inactivation agents), meet legislation restrictions (copper-based algaecides, herbicides, dreissenids), or are not currently implemented (hypolimnetic withdrawal). The selection of promising interventions requires a proper diagnosis of each problem lake, based on water- and nutrient fluxes, the biology of the lake (plants, fish), the function of the lake and the characteristics of the method, such as efficacy, costs, safety and ease of implementation. In the Netherlands, ongoing diffuse loads and legacies necessitate repetitive in-lake interventions.},

abstract={Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CyanoHABs) are an increasingly common feature of large, eutrophic lakes. Non-N2-fixing CyanoHABs (e.g., Microcystis) appear to be proliferating relative to N2-fixing CyanoHABs in systems receiving increasing nutrient loads. This shift reflects increasing external nitrogen (N) inputs, and a<e2><80><89>><e2><80><89>50-year legacy of excessive phosphorus (P) and N loading. Phosphorus is effectively retained in legacy-impacted systems, while N may be retained or lost to the atmosphere in gaseous forms (e.g., N2, NH3, N2O). Biological control on N inputs versus outputs, or the balance between N2 fixation versus denitrification, favors the latter, especially in lakes undergoing accelerating eutrophication, although denitrification removal efficiency is inhibited by increasing external N loads. Phytoplankton in eutrophic lakes have become more responsive to N inputs relative to P, despite sustained increases in N loading. From a nutrient management perspective, this suggests a need to change the freshwater nutrient limitation and input reduction paradigms; a shift from an exclusive focus on P limitation to a dual N and P co-limitation and management strategy. The recent proliferation of toxic non-N2-fixing CyanoHABs, and ever-increasing N and P legacy stores, argues for such a strategy if we are to mitigate eutrophication and CyanoHAB expansion globally.},

High elevation, boreal forests generally receive higher atmospheric Hg deposition and regional studies have subsequently identified elevated blood Hg concentrations in songbird species inhabiting these montane habitats. The overall goal of this study was to investigate spatial and seasonal Hg exposure patterns in songbird species along an elevational gradient on Whiteface Mountain in the Adirondack Park of New York State. Songbird blood samples were collected from June<e2><80><93>July in 2009 and 2010 along an elevational gradient at 13 study plots (450<e2><80><93>1400<e2><80><89>m) with a focus on Catharus thrushes, including the hermit thrush, Swainson<e2><80><99>s thrush, and Bicknell<e2><80><99>s thrush. The main results of this study documented: (1) an overall linear pattern of increasing blood Hg concentrations with increasing elevation, with additional analysis suggesting a nonlinear elevational pattern of increasing blood Hg concentrations to 1075<e2><80><89>m, followed by decreasing concentrations thereafter, for all Catharus thrush species across the elevational gradient; and (2) an overall nonlinear seasonal pattern of increasing, followed by decreasing blood Hg concentrations across target species. Avian exposure patterns appear driven by elevated atmospheric Hg deposition and increased methylmercury bioavailability within high elevation habitats as compared with low elevation forests. Seasonal patterns are likely influenced by a combination of complex and dynamic variables related to dietary selection and annual molting cycles. Considering that few high elevation analyses have been conducted within the context of regional songbird research, this project complements the results from similar studies and highlights the need for further monitoring efforts to investigate environmental Hg contamination within avian communities.},

abstract={Deleterious health effects in humans and wildlife are associated with the consumption of fish contaminated by mercury (Hg). This study was conducted to assess Hg concentrations in biota of the Finger Lakes (New York, USA), a region where fisheries are important for the economy but where no assessment of the drivers of food web Hg dynamics exists to date. Additionally, this region is of interest for the study of Hg bioaccumulation because of the importance of agricultural land cover, which can affect lake trophic status and thus the bioavailability of methyl Hg (MeHg). The study objectives were to (1) assess if fish Hg concentrations were of concern to humans and wildlife, (2) determine if differences in biota Hg concentrations exist among lakes, and (3) assess models developed for New York State as predictors of present day Finger Lakes fish Hg concentrations. Exploratory analyses were also conducted to assess predictors of fish Hg concentrations using lower trophic level MeHg concentrations, water quality, and lake and land cover characteristics. Fish concentrations were above the EPA criterion (300<e2><80><89>ng/g wet weight, ww) in 24% of fish, but only Walleye (Sander vitreus) from Owasco Lake exceeded New York State Department of Health consumption guidelines (1000<e2><80><89>ng/g ww). The threshold indicating biological changes within fish (500<e2><80><89>ng/g ww) was exceeded in 11% of the individuals sampled. Significant differences were found among lakes for all fish species except Largemouth Bass (Micropterus salmoides). Notably, Lake Trout (Salvelinus namaycush) had significantly lower Hg concentrations in Cayuga Lake compared to other Finger Lakes. This trend was not mirrored in the lower food web, as benthic invertebrates had higher MeHg concentrations in Cayuga Lake. Using models developed for New York State in 2003<e2><80><93>2005, observed concentrations in 90% of fish were different (<c2><b1>200<e2><80><89>ng/g ww) than expected.

abstract={Mercury (Hg) is a potent neurotoxin that biomagnifies within both aquatic and terrestrial food webs resulting in adverse physiological and reproductive effects on impacted wildlife populations, including songbird communities. Due to reducing conditions, wetland ecosystems promote the formation of methylmercury. Regional studies have documented elevated blood mercury concentrations in songbird species within these habitat types. The overall goal of this research was to examine spatial and seasonal patterns of Hg exposure for targeted songbird species within Sphagnum bog wetland systems and compare these patterns with adjacent upland forests in the Adirondack Park of New York State. Project sampling was conducted at study plots within four Sphagnum bog and associated upland forest sites from May - August during the 2008, 2009, and 2011 field seasons. The overall results documented: (1) blood Hg concentrations were elevated in songbird species inhabiting Sphagnum bog habitats as compared to nearby upland forest species; (2) target species within each habitat type exhibited consistent species-level patterns in blood Hg concentrations at each study site; and (3) no seasonal change in blood Hg concentrations within Sphagnum bog habitats was documented, but an increasing, followed by a decreasing seasonal pattern in mercury exposure was detected for upland forest species. Habitat type was demonstrated to influence avian Hg exposure levels. Moreover, Sphagnum bog ecosystems may be contributing to elevated Hg concentrations in biota within the surrounding environment. Seasonal patterns for blood Hg concentrations were found to vary between habitat type and are likely related to a combination of variables including habitat-driven Hg concentrations in prey items, seasonal dietary shifts, and annual molting cycles. This project emphasizes the importance of prioritizing future research efforts within identified high Hg habitat types, specifically wetland systems, to better characterize associated avian exposure levels, estimate the spatial extent of wetland systems on the surrounding environment, and identify locations of potential biological hotspots across the Adirondack Park.},

Trends in fish tissue mercury concentrations in North American lakes with marked overall decreases were reported over the period 1972<e2><80><93>2016. These trends are consistent with reported mercury emission declines as well as trends in wet deposition across the U.S. and Canada. More recently, a leveling-off in the rate of decreases or increases in fish tissue mercury concentrations has been reported. Increased emissions of mercury from global sources beginning between 1990 and 1995, despite a decrease in North American emissions, have been advanced as an explanation for the observed changes in fish tissue trends. In addition to increased atmospheric deposition, the other factors identified to explain the observed mercury increases in the affected fish species include a systematic shift in the food-web structure with the introduction of non-native species, creating a new or expanding role for sediments as a net source for mercury. The influences of climate change have also been identified as contributing factors, including considerations such as increases in temperature (resulting in metabolic changes and higher uptake rates of methylmercury), increased rainfall intensity and runoff (hydrologic export of organic matter carrying HgII from watersheds to surface water), and water level fluctuations that alter either the methylation of mercury or the mobilization of monomethylmercury. The primary source of mercury exposure in the human diet in North America is from the commercial fish and seafood market which is dominated (>90%) by marine species. However, very little information is available on mercury trends in marine fisheries. Most of the data used in the published marine trend studies are assembled from earlier reports. The data collection efforts are generally intermittent, and the spatial and fish-size distribution of the target species vary widely. As a result, convincing evidence for the existence of fish tissue mercury trends in marine fish is generally lacking. However, there is some evidence from sampling of large, long-lived commercially-important fish showing both lower mercury concentrations in the North Atlantic in response to reduced anthropogenic mercury emission rates in North America and increases in fish tissue mercury concentrations over time in the North Pacific in response to increased mercury loading.},

Whole-body Hg in <e2><89><a5>1 prey fish FT exceeded wildlife thresholds of 40<e2><80><89>ng/g and 100<e2><80><89>ng/g at 91 and 51% of sites, respectively. Environmental drivers of recent spatial patterns include extent of forest cover and storage, the latter an indicator of wetlands. Standardized Hg scores increased with increasing atmospheric Hg deposition and storage across rural <e2><80><98>upland<e2><80><99> regions of New York. However, scores were not related to atmospheric deposition in more-developed <e2><80><98>lowland<e2><80><99> regions due to the limited methylation potential of urban landscapes. Comparisons of 2010<e2><80><93>2015 sportfish Hg concentrations with those of 1998 and 2000<e2><80><93>2005 showed inconsistent temporal changes both among and within eight sites examined.

abstract={Johansson ML, Lavigne SY, Ramcharan CW, Heath DD, MacIsaac HJ. Detecting a spreading non-indigenous species using multiple methodologies. Lake Reserv Manage. 36:432<e2><80><93>443. Non-indigenous species (NIS) are often introduced to novel environments at very low population abundance. Detecting the presence of such an NIS can be very challenging, particularly as it spreads from the initial establishment site. This provides an opportunity to test detection limits using different approaches. This study tested the detection capability of 3 methods as zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) spread from south to north through Lake Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Zebra mussel veliger larvae were detected using cross-polarized light microscopy (CPLM), flow cytometry and microscopy (FlowCam), and conventional polymerase chain reaction (cPCR) analysis of environmental DNA (eDNA) on the same samples. Abundance generally declined from south to north in the lake but was lowest at Calder<e2><80><99>s Dock (central). Although abundances could be quite low (i.e., <1 veliger/m3, Calder<e2><80><99>s Dock) CPLM prevalence<e2><80><94>the percentage of samples with at least one veliger<e2><80><94>was high throughout the lake (99<e2><80><93>100% of samples). Prevalence was lower for cPCR and FlowCam but was statistically associated with veliger abundance. Using standardized 3<e2><80><89>mL subsamples (0.06<e2><80><93>0.18 m3 of lake water sampled), all 3 methods had a high probability of veliger detection if large numbers of samples were processed. FlowCam was the most expensive method to process these 3<e2><80><89>mL subsamples, while cPCR was least expensive and fastest. eDNA combined with intensive sampling is the most practical method for wide-scale monitoring programs for early detection. However, all 3 methods are complementary and could be deployed sequentially, with rapid initial sample processing using PCR, confirmation and density estimation with FlowCam, and detailed veliger counts using CPLM.},

Highly productive salt marshes at the interface of terrestrial and marine systems have the potential to support megafauna species, but a recent global meta-analysis of consumer-plant interactions in marshes found few studies investigated impacts of wild megafauna. We conducted a literature review to document the variety of megafauna in salt marshes and found that 34 species utilize salt marshes, including sharks, manatees, pinnipeds, crocodilians, sea otters, hippos, and large terrestrial animals, such as lions, bears and water buffalo. The use of salt marsh habitats by a variety of megafauna may have implications for both the conservation of these large consumers and for the resilience of coastal wetlands through stabilizing feedbacks on plant ecosystems. Future studies should quantify the occurrence and impacts of megafauna in salt marshes, and how their conservation can help restore these valuable ecosystems.},

abstract={The Anzali wetland (located in northern Iran) and many parts of its catchment are considered important habitats for the swan mussel (Anodonta cygnea). The habitat of this native bioindicator mussel is being threatened in many locations of the catchment due to various anthropogenic activities. The present study aimed to apply a classification tree model (J48 algorithm) to predict the habitat preferences of A. cygnea in 12 sampling sites based on various water quality and physical-habitat variables. The species was present in 50% of sampling sites, while it was absent in the remaining of the sampling sites. In total, 144 samples of A. cygnea (72 presence and 72 absence instances) were monthly measured together with the abiotic variables during 1-year study period (2017<e2><80><93>2018). For the CT model, two-thirds of datasets (96 instances) served as a training and the remainder was employed for the validation set (48 instances). Among 25 environmental variables introduced to the model (with pruning confidence factor<e2><80><89>=<e2><80><89>0.10, threefold cross-validation and 5 times randomization effort), the validity of 6 variables was confirmed by the model in all three subsets. Water salinity, flow velocity, water depth and water turbidity were jointly predicted by the model in three subsets. The model predicted that the absence of A. cygnea might be associated with increasing flow velocity, total phosphate and water turbidity. In contrast, the presence of A. cygnea might be related to decreased water depth and increased calcium concentration. The model also confirmed that all predicted variables for the species might be completely dependent on the water salinity. According to the chi-square test (x2<e2><80><89>=<e2><80><89>26.53, p<e2><80><89><<e2><80><89>0.05), the habitat condition of A. cygnea is influenced by significant variations in the spatio-temporal patterns.},

abstract={Sewage effluent effects on the biochemical parameters of Astyanax bimaculatus organs were investigateted. Treated sewage was collected in a treatment plant; 43 compounds, among them, pharmaceuticals and hormones, were investigated. Caffeine, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, ofloxacin, oxytetracycline, paracetamol, sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole, sulfathiazole and tylosin waste was detected in the collected material. Fish were divided into four groups: control, TSE (treated sewage effluent), TSE<e2><80><89>+<e2><80><89>P (TSE with increased concentration of five pharmaceuticals) and PTSE (TSE<e2><80><89>+<e2><80><89>P post-treated with O3/H2O2/UV). Biochemical parameters were evaluated in different organs after 14-day exposure. TBARS levels increased significantly in the brain of animals in the TSE and TSE<e2><80><89>+<e2><80><89>P groups in comparison to the control. There was significant reduction in TBARS levels recorded for the liver, muscle and gills of animals in the PTSE group in comparison to those of animals in the other groups. AChE activity reduced in the muscle of animals in the groups showing the highest pharmaceutical concentrations. CAT activity in the liver of animals in groups exposed to pharmaceutical effluent was inhibited. GST activity increased in brain of animals in the TSE<e2><80><89>+<e2><80><89>P and PTSE groups, whereas reduced levels of this activity were observed in liver of animals in the TSE group. Increased GST activity was observed in the brain of animals in TSE<e2><80><89>+<e2><80><89>P and PTSE groups. Based on integrated biomarker response values, the TSE<e2><80><89>+<e2><80><89>P group presented greater changes in the analyzed parameters. Results point out that pharmaceutical waste can cause oxidative stress, as well as affect biochemical and enzymatic parameters in Astyanax sp. Post-treatment can also reduce damages caused to fish, even in case of the likely formation of metabolites. Based on these results, these metabolites can be less toxic than the original compounds; however, they were not able to fully degrade the pharmaceutical waste found in the sewage, which can interfere in fish metabolism.},

The experimental design of this study was factorial (3<e2><80><89><c3><97><e2><80><89>3), including 0.0, 0.4, and 0.8<e2><80><89>mg<e2><80><89>L<e2><88><92>1 glyphosate and 0.0, 2.5, and 5<e2><80><89><c2><b5>g<e2><80><89>L<e2><88><92>1 chlorpyrifos. The exposure to chlorpyrifos, glyphosate alone and a mixture of them significantly decreased acetylcholinesterase, alkaline phosphatase, phenoloxidase activities, and total protein levels. The lactate dehydrogenase, glutamic-pyruvic-transaminase, and catalase activities, the contents of glucose, and malondialdehyde levels were increased in the crayfish. No significant changes were detected in glutamic-oxaloacetic-transaminase (SGOT) activity, triglyceride, and total antioxidant (TAO) levels in the crayfish treated with 0.4<e2><80><89>mg<e2><80><89>L<e2><88><92>1 glyphosate and the control group. Co-exposure of crayfish to chlorpyrifos and glyphosate increased SGOT activity and TAO levels.

The present study aimed to evaluate the influence of low-salinity exposure on the clearance rate, total heterotrophic marine bacteria and total Vibrio count in flesh, as well as the biochemical parameters of hemolymph and heat shock protein (HSP) gene expression, in Pinctada radiata. To this end, the oysters were reared for 14<c2><a0>days at salinities of 40 (control group), 35, 30, 25 and 20 PSU. Results indicated that low salinity led to a significantly lower clearance rate, with the lowest clearance rate observed at 20 PSU. However, no significant differences were found among the groups in the total heterotrophic marine bacteria, calcium concentration, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels. In addition, the results demonstrated that the total Vibrio count increased significantly in oysters exposed to the hypoosmotic condition. A reduction in glucose concentration was observed in the 25 and 20 PSU groups compared to the other experimental groups. In addition, the highest survival rate was found in the 40 and 35 PSU groups. Based on q-RT-PCR results, HSP70 and HSP90 mRNA levels were significantly up-regulated by low-salinity exposure, while the expression of HSP20 mRNA was remarkably down-regulated in the 35 and 30 PSU salinity groups. The present study shows that pearl oysters tolerate a wide range of salinities (40<e2><80><93>20 PSU), whereas optimal salinity for oyster culture ranges from 30 to 40 PSU. These results also provide a better understanding of the feeding behavior and physiological changes of P. radiata in response to salinity changes.},

The extent of microplastic pollution in deep-sea sediments remains poorly quantified, but this knowledge is imperative for predicting the distribution and potential impacts of global plastic pollution. We quantified microplastics in deep-sea sediments from the Great Australian Bight using an adapted density separation and dye fluorescence technique. We analyzed sediment cores from six locations ranging in ocean depths from 1,655 to 3,062 m and offshore distances ranging from 288 to 356 km from the Australian coastline. Microplastic counts ranged from 0 to 13.6 fragments g-1 dry sediment (mean of 1.26 <c2><b1> 0.68; n = 51). We found higher microplastic counts than recorded in other microplastic analyses of deep-sea sediments. Sample fragments were identified as polyisoprene, polyurethane, polyester, and polypropylene. A statistical analysis detected a relationship between sediment microplastic counts and the amount of plastic floating on the ocean surface above, as well as with the angle of the seafloor slope. The number of microplastic fragments in the sediment increased as surface plastic counts increased, and as the seafloor slope angle increased. Overall, however, the microplastic counts were highly variable, with variation between sediment cores at the same location being greater than the variation across the sampling sites. Our findings of microplastics in deep-sea sediment from the Great Australian Bight contributes to understanding where some of the <e2><80><98>hidden<e2><80><99> oceanic plastic pollution is distributed.},

This document updates the LEC's original goals and objectives from 2003 informed by periodic assessments of progress toward achievement. The new goal and vision re-affirm the commitments of fishery-management agencies from Michigan, New York, Ohio, Ontario, and Pennsylvania to cooperatively attain shared objectives that support fish communities and desired fisheries of societal benefit and a healthy ecosystem in accordance with A Joint Strategic Plan for Management of Great Lakes Fisheries (Joint Plan) (GLFC 2007). The mission advocates the use of the best available science to make decisions and inform fishery management by these five agencies following tenets of the Joint Plan and eleven guiding principles, including support from key partner and stakeholder groups. Presented are eleven fish community objectives with their associated targets that guide LEC decisions involving intensively managed species (fish populations that support broadly distributed fisheries and the invasive Sea Lamprey) (Table 1), other managed species (fish populations that support localized fisheries), rehabilitation species (important species that lack self-sustaining populations), and prey fish (largely unfished and unmanaged populations of ecological importance to the fish community). Measures to facilitate evaluation of progress for each objective every five years through state-of-the-lake conferences and reports are identified. The fish community objectives in this document explicitly focus on species that contribute to a functional food web for a healthy and resilient Lake Erie ecosystem and that sustain desired fisheries.},

abstract={Watershed-based approaches to addressing water quality issues often involve a diverse set of actors working collaboratively to develop policy. Such an approach is currently underway in the Western Lake Erie Basin, where the province of Ontario and the state of Ohio have embarked on a 40% phosphorus run-off reduction target to address eutrophication problems in the lake. In this study, we adopt the concept of discourse to inform our understanding of the collaborative process undertaken to develop domestic action plans (DAPs) to guide efforts by various stakeholders. We find that in both cases there were distinct groups of actors who shared and promoted a particular narrative or storyline. These storylines provided varying accounts of the science and policy aspects of the eutrophication problem in Lake Erie, and there was variation as well in the specific actors to whom they attributed responsibility. We illustrate how the storylines shaped the nature and form of the action plans. We provide a discussion of the policy implications of unequal capacities among different actor coalitions to influence trajectories and outcomes in the context of governance for water quality. It is shown that the potential of discourse coalitions to influence policy raises important questions as to whose voice is considered legitimate enough to be included in the policy process.},

abstract={Marinas create physical and biotic conditions distinct from those in natural habitats which can facilitate the establishment of non-indigenous species (NIS) in coastal ecosystems. Using a series of images spanning nine years, we detected the introduction and followed the expansion of the NIS Tubastraea coccinea and T. tagusensis populations at a recreational marina in a region of Southeastern Brazil where sun-corals are rarely found on natural substrates. Because sun corals are known to reduce diversity in natural invaded environments, we evaluated how different densities of sun-corals affected the benthic community. Overall, the NIS populations have grown exponentially from 2010 to 2019 inside the marina, occupying up to 60% of the available space. However, the population growth in the breakwater stopped in 2016. Local variation in the population growth across the marina might be associated with the high phytoplankton biomass and larval retention inside the marina, which are results of the lower hydrodynamics. The expansion of sun-coral coverage did not significantly affect the richness of benthic communities but was associated with a reduction of the native bryozoan Amathia brasiliensis, the overall abundance of mobile crustaceans, and an increase in the area covered by the exotic bryozoan S. errata. The fast substitution of a native ecosystem engineer for a NIS suggests signs of invasion meltdown associated with the expansion of Tubastraea spp.},

The most important variables in influencing habitat suitability for C. nigra are the mean temperature of May followed by the distance from urban areas, inland wetlands and hydrographic network. Exposure to wind turbine collision and electrocution resulted to be potentially high. In particular, in Northern Italy the main potential risk of mortality for C. nigra is posed by power lines, whereas in southern regions the species might be mostly threatened by wind turbines. Our approach makes it possible to detect suitable areas that, although not yet colonized by the species, would imply a high mortality risk should the species colonize them in the<c2><a0>future. The tool we provide<c2><a0>may therefore prove useful to conservationists and landscape planners in order to mitigate the impact of human infrastructures on this species<c2><a0>and encourage a more sustainable planning.},

title={Better off dead: assessment of aquatic disinfectants and thermal shock treatments to prevent the spread of invasive freshwater bivalves},
abstract={Biosecurity protocols designed to prevent further spread of invasive alien species have become a key component of invader management strategies. Yet, the species-specific efficacy of many biosecurity treatments are frequently unclear or unknown. Invasive quagga, Dreissena bugensis, and zebra mussels, D. polymorpha, are a serious threat to freshwater ecosystems worldwide. Here, we examine the effectiveness of immersion (<e2><89><a4><e2><80><89>90<c2><a0>min) within 2% or 4% solutions for two commonly used disinfectants (Virasure<c2><ae> Aquatic and Virkon<c2><ae> Aquatic) to cause mortality of adult Dreissena bivalves.

Complete mortality of D. polymorpha was observed following exposure to both disinfectants for 90<c2><a0>min, at both concentrations. However, high but incomplete mortality (40<e2><80><93>90%) was recorded for D. bugensis across disinfectant treatments. For both species, complete mortality was achieved following 30<c2><a0>s of steam. In addition, 10<c2><a0>s of hot air and 15<c2><a0>min exposure to 300<c2><a0>g of dry ice can both completely killed groups of D. polymorpha.

In this paper, we report that<c2><a0>the study of non-native species impacts on ecosystem function is an emerging topic in aquatic ecology, though studies measuring functions remain relatively uncommon. We hypothesized that study of ecosystem function can reveal emergent effects of non-native species when community structure appears to be unimpacted and the study of multiple functions has the potential to identify impacts masked by food-web complexity. We compiled information from Web of Science to create a pool of papers (n<e2><80><89>=<e2><80><89>199) addressing ecosystem functions and services that we surveyed to evaluate our hypotheses. The number of publications referencing ecosystem function has increased since 2002, but only 10% of papers measured ecosystem functions as defined in our work. Additionally, 80% of publications reporting functional metrics addressed primary production and nutrient fluxes, while a low number of manuscripts (6%) directly linked the impact of non-native species on ecosystem functions to ecosystem services. We recommend future work focus on less-studied functions (e.g., bioturbation, decay rate, biomagnification), assess multiple functional metrics, link functions to services, and use networks to understand impacts from multiple dimensions of an invaders ecology.},

abstract={The Laurentian Great Lakes have been subject to substantial modification from diverse anthropogenic stressors, including nutrient enrichment, climate change, chemical and biological pollutants, and invasive species, yet little is known of the relative historical influence of these factors. Here we analyze diverse fossil metrics from vibracores at two sites, a bay area (Anchor Bay) and a tributary (Clinton River) in the Lake St. Clair ecosystem to determine the ecological responses from land-use practices and invasive mussel invasions. Sediment cores spanning over 100<c2><a0>years indicated that the expansion of non-native Dreissena polymorpha and Dreissena rostriformis (dreissenid mussels) into Anchor Bay site after the mid-1990s was associated with ~<e2><80><89>60 to 95% reduction in algal and cyanobacterial abundances and twofold increase in sedimentary organic matter (SOM) and bioavailable phosphorus. These increases in SOM and bioavailable phosphorus are relatively similar to increases inferred from the late nineteenth century when large portions of the watershed were cleared and drained for agriculture. In contrast, the Clinton River site experienced a continuous increase in the influx of nutrients, organic matter, and elevated sedimentary phototrophic pigments during the twentieth century and into the twenty-first century. Site comparisons suggest different mechanisms inducing changes in primary production varied, where Anchor Bay was mainly affected by the comparatively recent (since ca. mid-1990s) endogenous influence of invasive species, while the Clinton River site was primarily influenced by the input of exogenous anthropogenic nutrients over the past 100<c2><a0>years. These new findings illustrate that watershed management and policies within large lakes with multi-jurisdictional (national) Area of Concerns should consider site-specific regulatory mechanisms.},

title={Carbon and nitrogen recycling during cyanoHABs in dreissenid-invaded and non-invaded US midwestern lakes and reservoirs},
abstract={Lakes and reservoirs play key roles in global carbon cycling, especially as a carbon sink. Enrichment of nutrients in lakes and reservoirs (eutrophication) and rising global temperatures favors the proliferation of bloom-forming cyanobacteria. Harmful blooms of cyanobacteria (cyanoHABs) alter carbon and nutrient cycling in freshwater ecosystems. Some evidence suggests the introduction or establishment of invasive mussel species (i.e., Dreissena spp.) also favor cyanoHAB formation through selective filter feeding, a process through which they may also impact biogeochemical processes including carbon cycling and sequestration. However, few studies have considered the combined effects of invasive mussels and cyanoHABs on carbon and nitrogen cycling in freshwater ecosystems. Here, we examined microbial community composition and biogeochemical attributes (including carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes) in eutrophic lakes, reservoirs, and rivers in western Ohio, eastern Indiana, and northern Kentucky during the cyanobacterial bloom period of the summer of 2015. Our samples include both sites impacted by invasive mussels and those where invasive mussels have not yet been observed. Based on 16S and 18S rRNA gene sequence analysis, we found that cyanobacterial and algal communities varied across sites and were most closely related to habitat (sediment or water column sample) and site, regardless of the presence of invasive mussels or other environmental factors. However, we did find evidence that invasive mussels may influence both carbon and nitrogen cycling. While the results are based on a single time point sampling, they highlight the interactions of multiple environmental stressors in aquatic ecosystems and the critical need for more temporally intensive studies of carbon and nutrient cycling in bloom- and mussel-impacted waters.},

title={On the environmental background of aquatic organisms for ecological niche modeling: a call for caution},
abstract={Ecological niche modeling (ENM) is a technique widely used in many disciplines of science. Recently, the extent of using the environmental background for ENM calibration has been pointed out as playing a crucial role in determining model outcomes. However, when modeling freshwater species, the need for a background refinement has been ignored and its consideration possesses important implications not taken into account before. Here, using Maxent algorithm and global occurrence data characterizing the distribution of the invasive freshwater turtle, Trachemys scripta, we performed ENM transfer and compared native and invasive niche estimates for the species in the environmental space. We used two environmental backgrounds: (a) a traditional area, based on the current distribution and dispersal capacity of the species, and (b) a more restricted area, which corresponds exclusively to freshwater bodies. Our analysis revealed strong differences between the traditional and the restricted backgrounds in niche transferability, with differences in Maxent probability values ranging from <e2><88><92><e2><80><89>0.59 to 0.41. Also, during comparisons between native and invasive niches, the niches were more similar when the traditional approach was used, compared to the restricted approach. Our results highlight the importance of considering the biological restriction of the species when establishing the extent of the background in ecological niche modeling; in this case, a more restricted area represented by freshwater environments.},

title={Rethinking restoration targets for American chestnut using species distribution modeling},
abstract={Given the scale and speed of contemporary environmental changes, intensive conservation interventions are increasingly being proposed that would assist the evolution of adaptive traits in threatened species. The ambition of these projects is tempered by a number of concerns, including the potential maladaptation of manipulated organisms for contemporary and future climatic conditions in their historical ranges. Following the guidelines of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, we use a species distribution model (SDM) to consider the potential impact of climate change on the distribution and quantity of suitable habitat for American chestnut (Castanea dentata), a functionally extinct forest species that has been the focus of various restoration efforts for over 100<c2><a0>years. Consistent with other SDMs for North American trees, our model shows contraction of climatically suitable habitat for American chestnut within the species<e2><80><99> historical range and the expansion of climatically suitable habitat in regions to the north of it by 2080. These broad changes have significant implications for restoration practice. In particular, they highlight the importance of germplasm conservation, local adaptation, and addressing knowledge gaps about the interspecific interactions of American chestnut. More generally, this model demonstrates that the goals of assisted evolution projects, which often aim to maintain species in their native ranges, need to account for the uncertainty and novelty of future environmental conditions.},

title={Ecological-social-economic assessment of zebra-mussel cultivation scenarios for the Oder (Szczecin) Lagoon},
abstract={The Systems Approach Framework with an integrated Ecological-Social-Economic assessment was applied to address the issue of zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) farming in the large Oder (Szczecin) Lagoon, southern Baltic Sea. Heavy eutrophication hampers the use of the lagoon and zebra mussel farming is considered as new use and potential measure to improve water quality. Three alternative scenarios were developed in interaction with local stakeholders: 1) the production of mussels as fresh feed and meal on a commercial basis seemed not profitable, because of a limited market for fresh mussels (zoos, aquaculture) and low prices for organic feed. 2) Mussel cultivation to improve transparency and attractiveness of bathing waters near beaches had only a limited potential (0.2<c2><a0>m improvement of Secchi depth). A higher mussel biomass would increase the risk of temporary hypoxia. 3) Mussels farms for improving the environmental status (according to EU Water Framework Directive) by supporting macrophyte restoration were considered as the most promising scenario. Our model simulations suggested that as soon as a compensation for nutrient removal is considered, all mussel farm scenarios could cover the costs. Experiments and literature confirm that the conditions for an environmental friendly farming approach in the lagoon are suitable. Steps towards and problems associated with an implementation, e.g. invasion of Dreissena bugensis (quagga mussel), are discussed. Each step of the Ecological-Social-Economic assessment and major lessons learnt are documented in detail. Altogether, the approach turned out to be very suitable for this issue.},

abstract={The objective of the study was to define the primary environmental factors affecting the composition of the macrobenthic community in an abandoned open cast sulphur mine pit lake that had been filled with water from a nearby river. We investigated habitats at various depths and the macrobenthic communities; samples were collected by scuba divers. Although rush and submerged vegetation in the subsaline pit lake was abundant and provided potentially good habitat conditions for mayflies, caddisflies, coleopterans, or damselflies, the native insects were scarce. The taxa do not have many representatives in waters with elevated salinity, so those present in the MachÃ³w pit lake were mainly euryhaline species. Chironomids were the most abundant macroinvertebrates in shallower zones, whereas non-native zebra mussels were the quantitatively dominant taxon in deep-water zones. Moreover, these non-native mussels were the dominant biomass of invertebrates at all sites in all seasons. The current composition of the invertebrate assemblage was probably primarily determined by the salinated water, which limited the abundance of native species and gave non-native species an edge.Alternate abstract:Ziel der Untersuchung war die Definition primÃ¤rer Umweltfaktoren die die Zusammensetzung der makrobenthischen Gemeinschaft in einem Bergbaufolgesee eines aufgegebenen Schwefeltagbaus, der mit Wasser aus einem nahegelegenen FluÃŸ aufgefÃ¼llt worden ist.

abstract={The invasion of dreissenid mussels into inland waters of the Northern Hemisphere has received considerable attention and, both zebra mussels and quagga mussels continue to spread westward. Despite studies aimed at understanding the biology of dreissenid mussels, relatively few studies have focused on water velocity and other hydrodynamic characteristics of water flow. The objective of this review was to identify, through a search of online databases, the papers that have been made available that directly have assessed the influence of hydrodynamic characteristics of water flow on dreissenid mussel biology. Using Thompson Reuters Web of Science, Google Scholar, and other resources, 46 papers were identified. These papers detailed that metrics associated with hydrodynamics of water flow, including current, wave action, velocity, flow rate, and discharge, can influence the biology of dreissenid mussels (primarily zebra mussel, which were studied far more than quagga mussel). Hydrodynamic characteristics influenced external fertilization, larval development and settlement, juvenile recruitment and attachment, and suspension feeding, growth and abundance of adults. In most cases, the impact of higher flow rates were locally negative and may present an opportunity for applications of water flow to control the spread or establishment of dreissenid mussels. Several knowledge gaps have been identified.},

abstract={Dreissena polymorpha and D. rostriformis bugensis are freshwater Ponto-Caspian bivalve species, at present widely distributed in Europe and North America. In the Szczecin Lagoon (a southern Baltic coastal lagoon), the quagga was recorded for the first time in 2014 and found to co-occur with the zebra mussel, a long-time resident of the Lagoon. As the two species are suspected of being competitors where they co-occur, their population dynamics was followed at a site the new immigrant was discovered (station ZS6, northern part of the Lagoon) by collecting monthly samples in 2015-2017. The abundance and biomass of the two congeners showed wide fluctuations, significant differences being recorded between months within a year and between years. The abundance and biomass proportions between the two congeners changed from an initial domination of the newcomer quagga until mid-2015 to a persistent domination of the zebra mussel throughout the remainder of the study period. Both the abundance and biomass of the two dreissenids showed a number of significant associations with environmental variables, notably with salinity, chlorophyll a content, and temperature. The co-occurrence of the two dreissenids in the Lagoon is discussed in the context of their invasion stage; it is concluded that while the quagga seems to have achieved the â€œoutbreakâ€ stage, the zebra mussel, an â€œaccommodatedâ€ invader present prior to the quagga immigration, reverted to that stage.},

Different filtering techniques carried out on the banks of the Ebro (EB) and J<c3><ba>car (JU) rivers (Eastern Spain) in different water conditions are compared. Low volume water filtration from the banks is a method sensitive enough to detect variations in larval density due to water temperature and flow rates.

In JU, different spawning strategies and a much extended period of larval releasing into the water occurred in two consecutive years. The presence of larvae in both rivers was constant for many months of the year, during which various reproductive cycles occurred, facilitated by high water temperatures during mid-spring to late fall. Shoreline surveys can be easily used for allowing the early warning of the presence of this dangerous invasive species, mitigating damages and preventing its spread into new areas.

The observed changes in bed stability with bed age will modify the transfer of particulate materials to the offshore profundal zone as well as the rates and magnitudes of sediment-associated nutrients in the near shore zone.ConclusionsBiostabilization of surficial lake-bottom sediments impacted by mussel biodeposits may increase bed stability and reduce the export of particulate matter to the offshore environment. Further, well-developed communities of dreissedid mussels have an armoring effect on deposited sediment, which reduces remobilization of sediment and biodeposits. However, once eroded, the dreissedid modified deposits will likely be transported further due to their low-settling velocity.},

title={Effects of zebra mussels on cladoceran communities under eutrophic conditions},
abstract={The purpose of this study was to determine how zebra mussels affected cladoceran community structure under eutrophic conditions. We conducted a mesocosm study where we manipulated the presence of zebra mussels and the presence of large-bodied Daphnia (Daphnia magna and Daphnia pulicaria). We also conducted a complimentary life-table experiment to determine how water from the zebra mussel treatment affected the life history characteristics of the cladoceran species. We anticipated that small- and large-bodied cladoceran species would respond differently to changes in algal quality and quantity under the effects of zebra mussels. Large-bodied Daphnia successfully established in the zebra mussel treatment but failed to grow in the control. We did not observe positive relationships between food concentrations and cladoceran abundances. However, the phosphorus content in the seston indicated that food quality was below the threshold level for large-bodied cladocerans at the beginning of the experiment. We believe that zebra mussels quickly enhanced the phosphorus content in the seston due to the excretion of inorganic phosphorus, thus facilitating the development of large-bodied Daphnia. In conclusion, our results suggest that zebra mussels can alter the phosphorus content of seston in lakes and this can affect the dynamics of crustacean zooplankton.},

abstract={The food web positioning of the non-native round goby (Neogobius melanostomus Pallas, 1814) was studied in a new invasive population in Mariehamn, <c3><85>land Islands (northern Baltic Sea). The trophic position and isotopic niche space was compared to other benthic-feeding fish species in the same habitat. The trophic position (TP) was estimated based on stable isotope analysis of carbon (13C:12C) and nitrogen (15N:14N) ratios and compared to that of an established invasive population in Hel, Gulf of Gdansk (southern Baltic Sea). Ontogenetic changes in isotope signatures were evaluated with a regression analysis and compared between the two populations. The round goby positioned as a second-order consumer on the third trophic level among other benthic-feeding fish. It showed a similar trophic position and significant isotopic niche overlap with large perch. The trophic position of round gobies in Mariehamn is significantly higher than in Hel, likely due to different prey items. Furthermore, the ontogenetic patterns differ between the two invasive populations, also suggesting differing resource and habitat availability and levels of intraspecific competition between areas.},

abstract={Over the past few decades, Lake Mead (Nevada-Arizona, USA) has experienced multiple ecosystem stressors including drought, increased water demand, and establishment of invasive species (quagga mussels, gizzard shad). Despite these potential stressors, zooplankton and phytoplankton community dynamics in the pelagic regions of Lake Mead have generally followed consistent seasonal patterns. Long-term monitoring results (2007<e2><80><93>2015) show that zooplankton and phytoplankton communities remain relatively stable in Lake Mead on an inter-annual basis, but are susceptible to shifts caused by extreme climate fluctuations and alterations in mixing regimes. A warm winter characterized by low snowpack in 2014/2015 preceded a large bloom of toxic cyanobacteria (Microcystis aeruginosa K<c3><bc>tzing) in Las Vegas Bay the following summer. Large bloom events are rare in Lake Mead; however, under future climate scenarios, these types of events may become more frequent. Because of the consistency of plankton community dynamics over an extended period of time, Lake Mead offers an ideal system for the study of future climate change impacts. This study aims to characterize the response of plankton communities in Lake Mead to both linear and dynamic environmental changes.},

title={Cyanobacteria reduce quagga mussel (<i>Dreissena rostriformis bugensis</i>) spawning and fertilization success},
abstract={Quagga mussels (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) are highly fecund broadcast spawners invasive to freshwaters of North America and western Europe. We hypothesized that environmental cues from phytoplankton can trigger gamete release in quagga mussels. Nutritious algae may stimulate dreissenid spawning, but less palatable food, such as bloom-forming cyanobacteria, could be a hindrance. The objective of our study was to test whether exposure to cyanobacteria can inhibit quagga mussel spawning and fertilization. We assessed spawning in the presence of serotonin, a known spawning inducer, where adult quagga mussels placed in individual vials were exposed to 13 cyanobacteria cultures and purified algal toxin (microcystin-LR) with artificial lake water as the control. Fertilization success was evaluated by combining eggs with sperm in conjunction with cyanobacteria, and enumerating zygote formation marked by cellular cleavage. Several cyanobacterial strains reduced spawning and fertilization success, but microcystin-LR had no effect. Fertilization was more sensitive to cyanobacteria than gamete release. Only 1 culture, Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, inhibited spawning, whereas 6 cultures consisting of Anabaena flos-aquae, Dolichospermum lemmermanii, Gloeotrichia echinulata, Lyngbya wollei, and 2 Microcystis aeruginosa isolates reduced fertilization rates by up to 44%. The effects of cyanobacteria on reproduction in invasive freshwater mussels in the wild have not yet been identified. However, our laboratory studies show that concentrations of cyanobacteria that are possible during bloom conditions probably limit reproduction. Reproductive consequences on wild populations may become more prevalent as cyanobacteria blooms occur earlier in the year, making overlap between blooms and mussel spawning more common. Describing the mechanism by which cyanobacteria inhibit spawning and fertilization could reveal novel control methods to limit reproduction of this invasive species.},

abstract={Understanding patterns of resource use is an important aspect of the conservation and management of animal populations. We used stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen from nail samples of Western Painted Turtles (Chrysemys picta bellii) to examine isotopic niches for individuals in an urban population. Western Painted Turtles are omnivorous, so we predicted that there would be little isotopic niche variation by sex, location, or age class. In contrast to our prediction, isotopic niche size varied up to three times among groups; females inhabiting marsh habitat had the largest niche, whereas females inhabiting creek habitat had the smallest. Isotopic niches overlapped 26-77%, with the least overlap between adult males and females, indicating niche partitioning by sex. Body size and location also contributed to the diversity of resource use. Isotopic mixing models indicated that all turtles consumed low proportions of a variety of prey items, but there were differences among groups. Turtles inhabiting creek habitat consumed higher proportions of chironomid larvae, whereas those in marsh habitat consumed higher proportions of crayfish and amphipods. Our findings indicate that urban turtles take advantage of a wide range of prey, and that aquatic systems with high productivity and diversity are well suited for maintaining turtle populations.},

title={Transmission and terrestrial dispersal of non-native ectosymbionts on invasive crayfish},
abstract={Symbionts are a fundamental component of biological systems, and their survival is highly dependent on transmission and host movement. Ectosymbionts of amphibious animals face the added challenge of having to survive dramatic environmental changes as their hosts cross ecosystem boundaries. Within freshwaters, crayfish are amongst the most widespread invasive species that readily disperse overland and are host to a wide range of ectosymbionts. Relatively little is known about the transmission of these ectosymbionts, including their ability to survive overland host migration. Here, we assessed terrestrial emigration and both inter- and intra-specific transmissions of Xironogiton victoriensis, a non-native branchiobdellidan (Annelida: Clitellata) recently found on invasive signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) in the UK. These branchiobdellidans tolerated desiccation and did not alter host terrestrial behaviour. Transmission was rapid between natural signal and novel virile (Orconectes cf. virilis) crayfish hosts, with host interactions facilitating transmission. Thus, branchiobdellidans can disperse via amphibious host behaviour and readily infect novel hosts. These traits facilitate symbionts<e2><80><99> survival and provide access to additional dispersal pathways that are likely to aid transmission.},

abstract={After Chelicorophium curvispinum, two other Ponto-Caspian tube-dwelling, filter-feeding amphipod species (Chelicorophium robustum and Chelicorophium sowinskyi) have colonized several catchments in Central and Western Europe in recent decades. To reveal the mechanism of niche differentiation among them, we measured the mesh sizes of their filtering apparatus and analyzed multi-habitat sampling data from the River Danube using RDA-based variance partitioning between environmental and spatial explanatory variables. Morphometric data showed a clear differentiation among the species by filter mesh size (C. curvispinum<e2><80><89>><e2><80><89>C. robustum<e2><80><89>><e2><80><89>C. sowinskyi). Field data also indicated the relevance of suspended matter; however, the mere quantity of suspended solids included in the analysis could not explain the abundance patterns effectively. Current velocity, substrate types, and total nitrogen content also had a non-negligible effect; however, their role in the niche differentiation of the species is not evident. In summary, differences in their filter mesh sizes indicate a niche differentiation by food particle size among the invasive Chelicorophium species, allowing their stable coexistence given sufficient size variability in their food source. Consequently, the two recent invaders increase the effectiveness of resource utilization, resulting in a more intensive benthic<e2><80><93>pelagic coupling in the colonized ecosystems.},

abstract={Phenology is a key feature in the description of species niches to capture seasonality in resource use and climate requirements. Species distribution models (SDMs) are widespread tools to evaluate a species<e2><80><99> potential distribution and identify its large-scale habitat preferences. Despite its chief importance, data phenology is often neglected in SDM development. Non-migratory bats of temperate regions are good model species to test the effect of data seasonality on SDM outputs because of their different roosting preferences between hibernation and reproduction. We hypothesized that (1) the output of SDMs developed for six non-migratory European bat species will differ between hibernation and reproduction; (2) models built from datasets encompassing both ecological stages will perform better than seasonal models. We employed a dataset of 470 independent occurrences of bat hibernacula and 400 independent records of nursery roosts of selected species and for each species we developed separate winter, summer and mixed (i.e. generated from both winter and summer occurrences) models. Seasonal and mixed potential ranges differed from each other and the direction of this difference was species-specific. Mixed models outperformed seasonal models in representing species niches. Our work highlights the importance of considering data seasonality in the development of SDMs for bats as well as many other organisms, including non-migratory species, otherwise the analysis will lead to significant biases whose consequences for conservation planning and landscape management may be detrimental.},

Evaluating propagule pressure associated with multiple introduction pathways relative to present NAS distribution patterns may identify which pathway presents the greatest risk. Our objective was to develop and evaluate three geospatial metrics for the Laurentian Great Lakes as proxies of propagule pressure associated with three major introduction pathways: maritime commerce, organisms in trade, and water recreation. Logistic and linear regression analyses were conducted between NAS presence and introduction pathway intensity (e.g., number of vessel trips received by a port) for 23 NAS over a five-decade period (1970<e2><80><93>2013). Notably, city population size was the best predictor of NAS presence, even for NAS introduced through ballast water discharge. Moreover, through time, city population size was an increasingly significant predictor of the presence of organisms in trade, signaling a change in both the types of organisms introduced and places where introductions are occurring. Nonetheless, all three metrics are reasonable proxies for propagule pressure and as such are applicable for risk assessment, monitoring, and control strategies.},

This study estimated the environmentally suitable areas for occurrence of eight tilapia species (genera Coptodon, Oreochromis, Pelmatolapia, and Sarotherodon) in the Americas and their invasive potential using Ecological Niche Models (ENMs). The United States is the most invaded country, receiving all tilapia species. In South America, the southeast and south regions of Brazil are highlighted as the areas where two species are concentrated. The ENMs predicted that all tilapia species have high invasive potential in the Americas, and despite having more tilapias in North America, South and Central Americas are more susceptible to tilapia invasion. All South American basins were predicted to harbor tilapia species that have not yet arrived on the subcontinent. Our study evidences the need to implement management measures and governmental policies in the Americas to deal with problems caused by tilapia introductions. In North America, the focus is on the control of tilapia populations and in Central and South America priority should be given to contention of introduction processes.},

Reservoirs from the Paran<c3><a1> basin showed the highest number of occurrences, with 33 non-native species recorded only in the Itaipu reservoir. Beta diversity of non-native species showed higher variability among reservoirs from different basins than those within the same basin. Some basins were also distinguished by their composition of non-native species, as supported by the IndVal index. Non-native species were widespread along Brazilian reservoirs, and their distribution can be even higher than reported.},

abstract={Invasive dreissenid mussels have altered plankton abundance and nutrient cycling in the Great Lakes. In this study, a 1-D hydrodynamic-biogeochemical coupled model is developed to investigate their effects at a mid-depth offshore site in Lake Michigan. Model simulation shows that water surface temperature and vertical thermal structure can be well reproduced. Driven by the simulated vertical mixing, the biological model solves the transport and transformation of nutrients, plankton and detritus in the water column. Mussel grazing and excretion are added at the bottom boundary. The biological model predicts a notable decline of phytoplankton biomass and considerable increase of dissolved phosphorus (DP) in the entire water column at the end of spring. However, the reduction of phytoplankton and the increase of DP are limited to the bottom 20<c2><a0>m in summer as a result of the strong stratification. Model results also show that mussels can maximize particle delivery to the benthos, as the modeled benthic diffusive flux of particulate phosphorus exceeds the passive settling rate by 4.2<c3><97> on average. Model simulation over a 10-month period indicates that profundal mussels have the potential to significantly change the distribution of energy and nutrients in the water column, even in a deep and stratified environment.},

The goal was to investigate the feeding patterns of this species in an invaded freshwater habitat, where it first appeared at the beginning of 1990s, with implications for assessing its possible effects on invaded ecosystems. In total, 36 prey items were identified in the diet of S. abaster. The most important prey were zooplanktonic organisms, among which copepods predominated significantly. The second most important prey were cladocerans, represented by 20 species/genera. The diet composition of this species showed clear seasonal dynamics but copepods remained the predominant prey item throughout the year. Significant positive relationships between the abundance of zooplanktonic organisms in the gut contents of S. abaster and their abundance in zooplankton samples were found for copepods and Ceriodaphnia sp. S. abaster showed a significant positive electivity for copepods throughout all months. It also positively selected some large cladocerans, which probably shared the same habitat. S. abaster also consumed fish items including gobiid larvae and its own juveniles, when they were abundant in May and especially in June. The possible effect of S. abaster on native ecosystems may include the shaping of zooplanktonic communities through selective predation on copepods. This species is unlikely to be a serious food competitor for native fish inhabiting European freshwaters, the majority of which are cyprinids. Nevertheless, it can have effects on some native fish through predation on their juveniles, which might share the same habitats.},

abstract={Introductions of the invasive zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) and quagga mussel (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) into hydrologically isolated water bodies have been attributed to overland transport via (recreational) boat hulls. Before a boat becomes a successful vector, mussels must (1) attach to the hull, (2) survive air exposure during overland transport and (3) establish a viable population either after detachment or release of spat during launching or sailing. This study mimics these dispersal barriers and assesses the potential of boat hull-mediated release into a recipient environment for both species. Individuals were allowed to attach to aluminium and fibreglass plates. Hereafter, attached individuals were exposed to air and subsequently submerged again. Zebra mussels had a significantly higher attachment rate than quagga mussels. The percentage of attached dreissenid mussels that detached alive during rewetting ranged between 7.9 and 21.8%. No significant difference was found between species and hull materials. However, alive detachment during rewetting was significantly higher after 24<c2><a0>h compared to 48<c2><a0>h of air exposure. Our data allow modelling introduction pressure of lakes if quantitative data on overland boat movement and the density of attached mussels are available.},

The aim of this study was to use sonar technologies and underwater imagery (videos, still images) in tandem with traditional Ponar sampling to predict Dreissena presence, and produce a habitat suitability map to enhance our understanding of its spatial distribution in the lower Niagara River, New York, USA. Geo-referenced maps of environmental variables were generated using three sonar technologies: side scan sonar, multibeam sonar, and an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler. Dreissena presence/absence was determined at 102 sites along a 10<c2><a0>km stretch using Ponar grabs supplemented by an underwater imagery. Substrate and near-bottom flow were the most important variables affecting Dreissena distribution. Habitats with coarse substrate and near-bottom flow of 0.6<e2><80><93>0.80<c2><a0>m/s were predicted to be most often occupied. The habitat suitability model indicates that almost 90% of the stream bed in the river can be considered highly- or moderately suitable habitat.

abstract={It takes time before a defensive phenotype can be effectively developed, which handicaps sessile bivalves exposed to acute predation risks. In a laboratory experiment, we examined whether predation threats induce zebra mussels to limit metabolic rates, serving as a fast-response defence that reduces the chances of chemical detection by predators. We measured the respiration rate of mussels exposed to predation treatments (fish fed zebra mussels, fish fed chironomids, crushed zebra mussels) and to predation-free conditions, and we tested the effect of these treatments on attachment strength and aggregation. Compared with the predation-free controls, all mussels in the predation treatments tended to initially have suppressed metabolic rates. The rate of metabolism increased over time in all treatments, but only in the presence of fish fed chironomids was the increase significantly greater than in the control. Attachment strengths and aggregation rates were similar for all treatments after 7<c2><a0>days. Our results provide the first evidence of predation-induced changes in zebra mussel metabolic rates. We suggest that mussels respond differently to different types of predation threats. Immediately after receiving predation cues, they react promptly by lowering their production of metabolites, but over time, they re-adjust their response to the actual predation threat present.},

Using constrained ordination analysis, we learned that the most significant variables explaining the variance in species composition were flow, human impact and elevation. Among the levels of the habitat factorial variable the most explicative were the lower Danube habitats, which shelter the richest naiad assemblages. Unionids diversity decreases significantly with increases in elevation and human impact. By comparing some communities with those of two decades ago, a contrasting image emerges. In some rivers where the former heavy pollution has been greatly reduced, the naiads are recovering. However, the average diversity of the communities that we compared is statistically lower at present than two decades ago, indicating that in some areas the ecological state of the freshwater systems is slightly worsening. Main causes are pollution, hydrotechnical constructions, invasive species and climatic changes.},

abstract={Ventenata [Ventenata dubia (Leers) Coss.], an invasive winter annual grass, significantly reduces forage production in grassland systems and displaces species within both perennialand annual-dominated grasslands within the Inland Northwest. The range of V. dubia is expanding into sagebrush steppe communities, an expansive habitat critical for forage production, wildlife, and recreation. Currently, there is limited knowledge of V. dubia's distribution and abundance within sagebrush steppe communities. We performed field surveys at 15 locations in sagebrush steppe rangelands in southern Idaho and eastern Oregon to assess where V. dubia occurs, with the aim of providing insight about its niche in this new habitat. Specifically, we evaluated biotic and abiotic factors of the plant community as indicators of V. dubia presence. We also correlated species diversity measures with no, low (<12.5%), and high (>12.5%) V. dubia cover. Though widely distributed throughout the study region, V. dubia only appeared in 45% of the 225 plots, and foliar cover was typically less than 50%. It was primarily found in ephemerally wet microhabitats. Species richness and the Shannon diversity index were lowest in plots with high V. dubia cover. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis revealed that V. dubia and medusahead [Taeniatherum caput-medusae (L.) Nevski] were closely associated. Furthermore, chi-square indicator analysis showed that T. caput-medusae was more prevalent, while mountain big sagebrush [Artemisia tridentata Nutt. spp. vaseyana (Rydb.) Beetle] was less prevalent, in plots containing V. dubia. Abiotic factors that explained variation in V. dubia abundance included rock cover, soil depth, and a north/south aspect. Higher V. dubia cover also correlated with higher clay content and lower phosphorus and potassium concentrations in the soil. We suggest that at this point, detection survey efforts to locate incipient infestations of V. dubia in sagebrush steppe communities should focus on moist areas and sites susceptible to invasion by T. caput-medusae.},

abstract={Bivalvia is a taxon of aquatic mollusks that includes clams, oysters, mussels, and scallops. Within heterodont bivalves, Dreissena polymorpha is a small, mytiliform, freshwater mussel that develops indirectly via a planktotrophic veliger larva. Currently, only a few studies on bivalve neurogenesis are available, impeding the reconstruction of a ground pattern in Bivalvia. In order to inject novel data into this discussion, we describe herein the development of the serotonin-like and <ce><b1>-tubulin-like immunoreactive (lir) neuronal components of D. polymorpha from the early trochophore to the late veliger stage. Neurogenesis starts in the early trochophore stage at the apical pole with the appearance of one flask-shaped serotonin-lir cell. When larvae reach the veliger stage, four flask-shaped serotonin-lir cells are present in the apical organ. At the same time, the anlagen of the cerebral ganglia start to form at the base of the apical organ. From the apical organ, one pair of cerebro-visceral connectives projects posteriorly and connects to a posterior larval sensory organ that contains serotonin- and <ce><b1>-tubulin-like flask-shaped cells. Additional, paired serotonin-lir neurites originate from the apical organ and project into the velum. One unpaired stomatogastric serotonin-lir cell develops ventrally to the stomach at the veliger stage. The low number of serotonin-lir cells in the apical organ of bivalve veligers is shared with larvae of basally branching gastropods and scaphopods and is thus considered a feature of the last common ancestor of Conchifera, while the overall simplicity of the larval neural architecture appears to be a specific trait of Bivalvia.},

title={Effects of turbulence exposure on zebra mussel (<i>Dreissena polymorpha</i>) larval survival},
abstract={To more accurately predict recruitment of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) in waterbodies downstream of a source population, factors that control the successful transport of zebra mussel larvae need to be quantified. Turbulence has been identified in previous studies as a likely factor in larval morality in rivers and streams where turbulent energy dissipation can be orders of magnitude greater than in lakes. To investigate the impact of turbulent energy dissipation on zebra mussel larval mortality, we conducted a series of experiments using lake water collected from Lake Minnetonka, Minnesota containing veligers in a jar test device. Results indicate that zebra mussel larval mortality is a function of veliger size, turbulent energy dissipation, and exposure time. The mortality at 24<c2><a0>h of turbulence exposure was fit to a function of d*, the ratio of shell size to Kolmogorov length scale, to develop a dose<e2><80><93>response curve. Mortality rate constants were estimated by fitting mortality data from specified turbulence regimes to a first-order model. The mortality rates ranged from 0.09 to 1.71<c2><a0>day<e2><88><92>1 and were correlated to energy dissipation.},

title={Seasonal effect of zebra mussel colonies on benthic processes in the temperate mesotrophic Plateliai Lake, Lithuania},
abstract={Sparse colonies of zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) create net heterotrophic sediment patches via respiration, excretion, and biodeposition activities, but their effect as biogeochemical hotspots is scarcely investigated in nutrient-limited ecosystems. We analyzed the seasonal effect of zebra mussel colonies on benthic respiration (O2, TCO2, N2, and CH4) and nutrient fluxes (NH4 +, NO x âˆ’ , SRP, and SiO2) in a macrophyte-dominated mesotrophic temperate lake. Intact sediments with and without zebra mussel aggregates were collected in winter, summer, and autumn, and incubated to measure fluxes. The contribution of mussel colonies alone to benthic metabolism was also quantified. Sediments with mussels always had higher rates of respiration (O2 and TCO2) and nutrient recycling (NH4 + and SRP) as compared to bare sediments, while there was no effect on CH4, NO3 âˆ’, and SiO2 fluxes. Mussel colonies stimulated nitrogen removal via denitrification, but only in the summer. The effect of colonies was particularly evident in warmer periods, due to mussel respiration and excretion and to biodeposits that increased microbial activity in sediments. In this mesotrophic lake, mussel aggregates contribute to alleviate nutrient (N and P) limitation, but their heterotrophic activity is likely buffered by nutrient uptake and oxygen production by submersed vegetation.},

title={Are long-term fish assemblage changes in a large US river related to the Asian Carp invasion? Test of the hostile take-over and opportunistic dispersal hypotheses},
abstract={Gizzard shad is a dominant planktivore/detritivore in the Wabash River, and populations crashed in the early 1990s. Previous work (1974-2008) identified a substantial shift in body-size structure and functional trait composition in the Wabash River fish assemblage between 1989 and 1996. Invasive Asian Carp appeared in the Ohio River basin including the Wabash River in the 1990s. Our goal was to test for temporal changes in assemblage composition and trophic structure relative to the invasion of Asian carp from the early 1990s. We hypothesized that establishment of Asian Carp was a contributor to the assemblage composition shift, and that their presence altered the trophic pathways and food sources of native fishes including Gizzard Shad (hostile takeover hypothesis). Alternatively, Asian Carp may have found success through capitalizing on an empty niche, likely left vacant by the decline in Gizzard Shad, or abundance changes in other trophic groups (opportunistic hypothesis). We utilized archival fish and mussel collections to test for trophic changes in the ecosystem using <ce><b4>13C and <ce><b4>15N stable isotope analyses. We examined stomach contents of the dominant planktivore/detritivore consumer, Gizzard Shad, from archival and recent collections to test for changes in the phytoplankton community. Stable isotopes indicated a community reliance on other, more deplete, carbon sources than indicated by the algae, and a slight increase between the <ce><b4>13C time periods. Although all functional feeding groups of fishes indicated some reduction in <ce><b4>15N, the differences were only significant for omnivores, mussels, and planktivore/detritivores. Although Asian Carp may have contributed to the collapse of Gizzard Shad populations, other stressors were likely more important drivers of their decline. This is the first, albeit indirect, evidence of opportunistic "invasion" as opposed to the historically presumed hostile takeover model.},

title={Climate change as a long-term stressor for the fisheries of the Laurentian Great Lakes of North America},
abstract={The Laurentian Great Lakes of North America provide valuable ecosystem services, including fisheries, to the surrounding population. Given the prevalence of other anthropogenic stressors that have historically affected the fisheries of the Great Lakes (e.g., eutrophication, invasive species, overfishing), climate change is often viewed as a long-term stressor and, subsequently, may not always be prioritized by managers and researchers. However, climate change has the potential to negatively affect fish and fisheries in the Great Lakes through its influence on habitat. In this paper, we (1) summarize projected changes in climate and fish habitat in the Great Lakes; (2) summarize fish responses to climate change in the Great Lakes; (3) describe key interactions between climate change and other stressors relevant to Great Lakes fish, and (4) summarize how climate change can be incorporated into fisheries management. In general, fish habitat is projected to be characterized by warmer temperatures throughout the water column, less ice cover, longer periods of stratification, and more frequent and widespread periods of bottom hypoxia in productive areas of the Great Lakes. Based solely on thermal habitat, fish populations theoretically could experience prolonged optimal growth environment within a changing climate, however, models that assess physical habitat influences at specific life stages convey a more complex picture. Looking at specific interactions with other stressors, climate change may exacerbate the negative impacts of both eutrophication and invasive species for fish habitat in the Great Lakes. Although expanding monitoring and research to consider climate change interactions with currently studied stressors, may offer managers the best opportunity to keep the valuable Great Lakes fisheries sustainable, this expansion is globally applicable for large lake ecosystem dealing with multiple stressors in the face of continued human-driven changes.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of specific environmental factors, such as temperature, pH, oxygen concentration, and phosphate, nitrate, chloride, sodium, potassium, sulphate, magnesium and calcium ions concentration, as well as microcystins, on the seasonal variations in the activity of the antioxidant system of the zebra mussel. We examined changes in lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels, glutathione content and the catalase activity of mussels inhabiting the two ecosystems, which differ due to their trophic structure and the presence of toxic cyanobacteria. The results show a relationship between the activity of the antioxidant system of zebra mussels and the seasonal fluctuations of environmental parameters: the symptoms of oxidative stress were generally the highest during spring and the lowest during summer in both ecosystems. Our study also revealed that regardless of the study area the most important factors determining the activity of the antioxidant defences of mussels were the mineral composition (particularly magnesium and calcium ions concentrations) and physical parameters of the water (oxygen concentration and pH). However, factors resulting from the trophic status of studied ecosystems, such as limitations in food resources or high concentration of microcystins during cyanobacterial blooms, were periodically responsible for increased level of LPO in the tissues of zebra mussel. These findings may indicate a limited tolerance of the zebra mussel to the local environmental conditions.},

abstract={The presence of non-native species can affect coevolved relationships. However, rapid reciprocal changes in coevolutionary associations provide the potential to quickly respond to a new situation. We studied a system where bitterling fish (Rhodeus amarus) parasitize unionid mussels by laying their eggs onto their gills. This association is affected by the infestation of unionid shells by the non-native zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha). In a series of experiments under experimental, semi-natural and natural conditions, we compared the behavioural response to zebra mussel infestation of unionid shells, its effect on oviposition decisions and their population consequences between bitterling populations na<c3><af>ve to zebra mussels and those recently sympatric with zebra mussels. We found no effect of recent sympatry on bitterling preoviposition behaviour and oviposition decisions and only a weak effect on their reproductive success. Bitterling from both populations inspected infested and non-infested mussels at the same rate but preferred to oviposit into non-infested unionid hosts. However, neither bitterling population completely avoided oviposition into infested unionids and three ovipositions into zebra mussels were observed. Overall, there was a clear negative relationship between the number of zebra mussels on unionid host shells and the number of juvenile bitterling emerging from the mussels. Our study demonstrated a lack of rapid evolutionary response to adaptively modulate oviposition choice after recent zebra mussel invasion.},

title={Identifying critical habitat for freshwater turtles: integrating long-term monitoring tools to enhance conservation and management},
abstract={The effective conservation and management of threatened species requires comprehensive knowledge about resource utilisation. Here we integrated tissue stable isotope analysis and biotelemetry to identify the predominant dietary resources of two sympatric species of freshwater turtle, and locate where those items were acquired. We deployed an array of underwater acoustic telemetry receivers to autonomously, simultaneously, and continuously, monitor the movements of the threatened Elseya albagula and Elusor macrurus, over a 12-month period. Stable isotope (SI) values (<ce><b4>13C and <ce><b4>15N) were measured within the carapace of each species, and compared with SI values within potential food items. The integration of movement information and carapace SI data revealed that whilst these species had overlapping home ranges, there was less than 5% probability of inter-species dietary niche overlap. E. macrurus acquired food items consisting of bivalves, gastropods and aquatic insects within rocky riffles whilst E. albagula fed on filamentous algae and crustaceans foraged from the muddy and vegetated shallow margins of deep water pools. Our findings differ from stomach content analysis and mark-recapture studies, which reported these species to have similar habitat and resource requirements. We argue that the observed disparity is because our methods provided a weighted measure of an individual's dietary preference and habitat utilisation over a broad time-scale, whilst stomach content analysis and mark-recapture studies offer only a single observation of an individual's dietary preference. The research demonstrates the utility of integrating passive acoustic telemetry and carapace stable isotope analysis for identifying critical habitat for freshwater turtles.},

title={Zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) affects the feeding ecology of early stage striped bass (Morone saxatilis) in the Hudson River estuary},
abstract={Variability in the feeding ecology of young fishes over short and long time scales in estuaries is likely to affect population dynamics. We studied 14 years of early stage Striped Bass feeding ecology in the Hudson River Estuary over a 25-year time span, including years in which invasive zebra mussels markedly altered energy flow within the estuary. We predicted that feeding success would be low and that diet composition would be altered during years of high zebra mussel impact, particularly in upriver locations where mussels occur. Feeding success in the short term was indicated by volume of gut contents and in the long term by dry mass at length, i.e. condition; these measures were positively intercorrelated and varied significantly year to year. We tested for associations between condition and multiple biotic and abiotic environmental variables. There was a strong negative effect of zebra mussel grazing rate on condition in upriver locations and a weak positive effect in downriver locations. In upriver locations, condition was 33% higher when local salinity was high and zebra mussel grazing rates were low, whereas in downriver locations, condition was 35% higher when zebra mussel grazing rates and copepod abundance were high and local dissolved oxygen was low. Copepods, amphipods, mysids, and Leptodora constituted the highest prey-specific index of relative importance throughout the estuary. There was no evident effect of the zebra mussel invasion on diet composition. This long-term study corroborates the inferences of earlier studies that zebra mussels reduced early-stage striped bass growth rate.},

title={Early detection monitoring for larval dreissenid mussels: how much plankton sampling is enough?},
abstract={The development of quagga and zebra mussel (dreissenids) monitoring programs in the Pacific Northwest provides a unique opportunity to evaluate a regional invasive species detection effort early in its development. Recent studies suggest that the ecological and economic costs of a dreissenid infestation in the Pacific Northwest of the USA would be significant. Consequently, efforts are underway to monitor for the presence of dreissenids. However, assessments of whether these efforts provide for early detection are lacking. We use information collected from 2012 to 2014 to characterize the development of larval dreissenid monitoring programs in the states of Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington in the context of introduction and establishment risk. We also estimate the effort needed for high-probability detection of rare planktonic taxa in four Columbia and Snake River reservoirs and assess whether the current level of effort provides for early detection. We found that the effort expended to monitor for dreissenid mussels increased substantially from 2012 to 2014, that efforts were distributed across risk categories ranging from high to very low, and that substantial gaps in our knowledge of both introduction and establishment risk exist. The estimated volume of filtered water required to fully census planktonic taxa or to provide high-probability detection of rare taxa was high for the four reservoirs examined. We conclude that the current level of effort expended does not provide for high-probability detection of larval dreissenids or other planktonic taxa when they are rare in these reservoirs. We discuss options to improve early detection capabilities.},

title={Zoochorous dispersal of freshwater bivalves: an overlooked vector in biological invasions?},
abstract={Vectors that underpin the natural dispersal of invasive alien species are frequently unknown. In particular, the passive dispersal (zoochory) of one organism (or propagule) by another, usually more mobile animal, remains poorly understood. Field observations of the adherence of invasive freshwater bivalves to other organisms have prompted us to assess the importance of zoochory in the spread of three prolific invaders: zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha; quagga mussel Dreissena bugensis; and Asian clam Corbicula fluminea. An extensive, systematic search of the literature was conducted across multiple on-line scientific databases using various search terms and associated synonyms. In total, only five publications fully satisfied the search criteria. It appears that some fish species can internally transport viable adult D. polymorpha and C. fluminea specimens. Additionally, literature indicates that veligers and juvenile D. polymorpha can adhere to the external surfaces of waterbirds. Overall, literature suggests that zoochorous dispersal of invasive bivalves is possible, but likely a rare occurrence. However, even the establishment of a few individuals (or a single self-fertilising C. fluminea specimen) can, over-time, result in a substantial population. Here, we highlight knowledge gaps, identify realistic opportunities for data collection, and suggest management protocols to mitigate the spread of invasive alien species.

abstract={The zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas, 1771), is a successful invasive bivalve native to the brackish and freshwaters systems of the Ponto-Caspian regions. It is considered one of the world's 100 worst invasive alien species and has high ecological and economic impacts. Over the past 200 years, it has expanded across the European and North American continents. Since the recent invasion of the Iberian Peninsula in 2001, D. polymorpha has expanded along the Ebro River basin and colonized adjacent basins in Northeastern Iberia. Using 9 microsatellite markers, we analyzed one population from the low Danube and several European and North American introduced locations, including a large number of Iberian sites, to genetically characterize the zebra mussel invasion and to identify putative routes of colonization. Our results reflect a high homogeneity of the Iberian samples, indicating that D. polymorpha colonized the Iberian Peninsula via a single invasion event. The genetic singularity of the populations observed in this region (including 9 unique alleles and significant genetic distances with the rest of analyzed samples) indicates that additional sites from the native and introduced range must be sampled to identify the source of the Iberian invasion.},

Biodiversity protection is a major target of the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive, requiring assessment of the status of biodiversity on the level of species, habitats, and ecosystems including genetic diversity and the role of biodiversity in food web functioning and structure. This paper provides a summary of the development of new indicators and refinement of existing ones in order to address some of the observed gaps in indicator availability for marine biodiversity assessments considering genetic, species, habitat, and ecosystem levels. Promising new indicators are available addressing genetic diversity of microbial and benthic communities. Novel indicators to assess biodiversity and food webs associated with habitats formed by keystone species (such as macroalgae) as well as to map benthic habitats (such as biogenic reefs) using high resolution habitat characterization were developed. We also discuss the advances made on indicators for detecting impacts of non-native invasive species and assessing the structure and functioning of marine food-webs. The latter are based on indicators showing the effects of fishing on trophic level and size distribution of fish and elasmobranch communities well as phytoplankton and zooplankton community structure as food web indicators. New and refined indicators are ranked based on quality criteria). Their applicability for various EU and global biodiversity assessments and the need for further development of new indicators and refinement of the existing ones is discussed.},

In this study, we quantified and compared for the first time the filtration rates of the zebra and quagga mussels and of two invasive Corbicula lineages (forms R and S) as a function of chlorophyll a concentration and season. The highest filtration rate observed was for the zebra mussel in fall and at high algal biomass. The incipient limiting level (ILL), defined as the chlorophyll a concentration at which the maximum filtration rate is observed, was observed in spring and summer in Corbicula species, and in summer and fall in Dreissena species. Overall, filtration rates presented a large range of variation, depending on chlorophyll a and season. Overall, Corbicula form S was observed as the best adapted to low food concentration. Moreover, Corbicula can switch to pedal feeding which gives them a competitive advantage at low chlorophyll a concentrations.},

Experiments were performed with juveniles of both species during a 24-h period. Habitat use was measured in channels with different habitat categories, and diel locomotor activity was registered with an infrared sensor. Both species used mainly cobbles. In the absence of O. mykiss, P. trucha used macrophytes and gravel secondarily, during dusk and midnight, respectively. Oncorhynchus mykiss used gravel and macrophytes secondarily, during midday. In the presence of O. mykiss, P. trucha increased its use of macrophytes and decreased its use of less structured habitats. Percichthys trucha juveniles were more active during night. This pattern did not change in the presence of O. mykiss, nor was the intensity of movement affected. These results reveal the importance of structured environments for juveniles of both species. In particular, substrates of large size with interstitial spaces in between serve as shelter and reduce visual detection between individuals. Both the association of P. trucha juveniles with structured habitats and their nocturnal activity reduce predation risk.},

Biomarkers of exposure (metallothioneins (MTs), ethoxyresorufin-o-deethylase (EROD)), oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation (LPO), DNA strand breaks (DNAsb)) and possible endocrine disruption (vitellogenin-like proteins (VTG)) were analysed in whole-tissue homogenates of differently sized groups of mussels in relation to environmental parameters and priority pollutants (heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons). Integrated biomarker response (IBR) indices were calculated for biomarker responses gained through in situ measurements to signalize critical sites and to better distinguish natural tendencies from biological effects of contaminants. Biomarker responses showed close positive correlation in case of MT, EROD, LPO, and DNAsb and negative correlation with VTG levels with mussel shell length in autumn, when higher levels of biomarkers appeared, possibly due to natural lifecycle changes of animals.},

abstract={The benthic stages of Dreissenidae and Mytilidae may be dispersed over long distances while attached to ship hulls. Alternatively, larvae may be transported by water currents and in the ballast and bilge water of ships and vessels. To gain insight into dispersal potential and habitat suitability, survival of the benthic stages of two invasive dreissenid species (Dreissena polymorpha and Mytilopsis leucophaeata) and one mytilid species (Mytilus edulis) chosen based on their occurrence in fresh, brackish and sea water, respectively, were tested in relation to salinity. They were exposed to various salinities in mesocosms during three long-term experiments at outdoor temperatures. Mussel survival was studied without prior acclimation, reflecting conditions experienced when attached to ship hulls while travelling along a salinity gradient from fresh or brackish water to sea water, or vice versa. Initially, mussels react to salinity shock by temporarily closing their valves, suspending ventilation and feeding. However, this cannot be maintained for long periods and adaptation to higher salinity must eventually occur. Bivalve survival was monitored till the last specimen of a test cohort died. The results of the experiments allowed us to distinguish favorable (f.: high tolerance) and unfavorable (u.: no or low tolerance) salinity ranges in practical salinity units (PSU) for each species, viz. for D. polymorpha 0.2-6.0 PSU (f.), 7.0-30.0 PSU (u.), for M. leucophaeata 0.2-17.5 PSU (f.), 20.0-30.0 PSU (u.) and for M. edulis 10.5-36.0 PSU (f.), 0.2-9.0 and 40 PSU (u.). At the unfavorable salinities, all mussels died within 14 days of initial exposure with the exception of M. edulis (23-30 days). The maximum duration of survival of single specimens of D. polymorpha was 318 days at a salinity of 3.2 PSU, of M. leucophaeata 781 days at 15.0 PSU and of M. edulis 1052 days at 15.0 PSU. The number of days survived was compared with the duration of actual ship voyages to estimate the real world survival potentials of species dependent of salinity changes, travel distances and durations. The conclusion is that salinity shocks during the trip were survived within the favorable salinity range but that the species tolerate only for a few weeks the unfavorable salinity range. This functions as a barrier for dispersal. However, at faster and more frequent shipping in the future salinity can become no longer very important as a dispersal barrier.},

abstract={Habitat modifications driven by human impact and climate change may influence species distribution, particularly in aquatic environments. Niche-based models are commonly used to evaluate the availability and suitability of habitat and assess the consequences of future climate scenarios on a species range and shifting edges of its distribution. Together with knowledge on biology and ecology, niche models also allow evaluating the potential of species to react to expected changes. The availability of projections of future climate scenarios allows comparing current and future niche distributions, assessing a species' habitat suitability modification and shift, and consequently estimating potential species' reaction. In this study, differences between the distribution maps of 406 marine species, which were produced by the AquaMaps niche models on current and future (year 2050) scenarios, were estimated and evaluated. Discrepancy measurements were used to identify a discrete number of categories, which represent different responses to climate change. Clustering analysis was then used to automatically detect these categories, demonstrating their reliability compared to human supervised classification. Finally, the distribution of characteristics like extinction risk (based on IUCN categories), taxonomic groups, population trends and habitat suitability change over the clustering categories was evaluated. In this assessment, direct human impact was neglected, in order to focus only on the consequences of environmental changes. Furthermore, in the comparison between two climate snapshots, the intermediate phases were assumed to be implicitly included into the model of the 2050 climate scenario.},

The mussel beds they form can provide shelter and food for detritivorous species, whereas fouling can directly impact native bivalves. In this study, we examined the effects of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) and quagga mussel (Dreissena rostriformis) on the macro-invertebrate community in the Meuse River by characterizing the macro-invertebrate assemblage associated with Dreissena clumps on artificial substrates at four sampling sites and by quantifying the infestation of Dreissena on native mussels along six transects. We found that the study site with dense Dreissena clumps on artificial substrates hosted particular macro-invertebrate assemblages that were composed of amphipods, gastropods and some insect larvae. Oligochaeta and Ephemeroptera abundances were low at this site. Non-native Ponto-Caspian amphipods occurred in very high densities in mussel beds, and we report the first records of several new invasive amphipod species in the Meuse River. Our results also revealed that ca. 40 % of sampled Unionidae were infested by Dreissena, although infestation load was low (0.48-2.51 Dreissena per native bivalve). These results suggested that the interactions between Dreissena and other macro-invertebrates ranged between a probably low incapacitating relationship with Unio resulting from a long coexistence which allowed the two species to live in sympatry and a strong facilitation for exotic amphipods native from the same region as Dreissena.},

title={Forecasting at the edge of the niche: Didemnum vexillum in Southeast Alaska},
abstract={Controlling the spread of marine invasive species is a challenging and costly task. Maps that predict the potential spread of an invader based on known habitat preferences can be extremely valuable for assessing invasion risk and prioritizing management actions for invasion control or prevention. Most maps are developed by using environmental data on the species' known distribution to map the potential niche of the species in a new location. However, this approach is complicated when a species spreads to an area where environmental conditions are much different than in other places it is known to exist. Didemnum vexillum was discovered in Southeast Alaska in 2010, marking the northernmost known range of this species. A self-organizing map (SOM) was used to assess potential habitat for D. vexillum in other parts of Southeast Alaska using summer and winter temperature and salinity as controlling factors. This research highlights the uncertainty of using the species' current distribution to evaluate potential spread to an environment at the edge of a species' environmental tolerances. It also identifies gaps in our knowledge of D. vexillum thermal and salinity tolerances, including potential synergistic and additive effects of both low temperature and low salinity, which limit investigation of mechanistic modeling methods.},

abstract={The introduction of the golden mussel, Limnoperna fortunei (Dunker, 1857) in South America was related to the discharge of ballast water, with its first record in 1991 in the La Plata River estuary. Since then, the species is spreading throughout the continent, with several economic and ecological negative consequences. Aim: To model, in the headwaters of Parana River, the spatial distribution of L. fortunei andtounderstandthe determinants of the current pattern of species distribution and the risk of invasion of areas not yet colonized. Methods: The ecological niche of L. fortunei was modeled using the algorithm MAXENT (Maximum Entropy Method) combined with records of occurrence of the bivalve, limnological data and the shear force measured by the index Hack (SL). The evaluation of the performance of different models was based on AUC (Area Under the Curve).The analysis of each variable's contribution to the responses of the models was made based on the Jackknife test, available in the Maxent program. The models were validated with real absence data collected between 2006 and 2007. Based on the limnological characterization of the area and on outputs of the models, this analysis sought to understand the contributing aspects to the current and potential spatial distribution and to verify the risk of invasion of environments not yet colonized by the species. Results/Conclusion: The limnological characterization showed that the ecological requirements for the species as, pH, calcium, oxygen and chlorophyll a, were appropriate in both the connected stretches, invaded and non-invaded. Turbidity showed significant spatial differences which proved to be higher in environments with higher levels of Hack (SL), i.e. higher energy fluvial. In addition, the algorithm showed the importance of hydrodynamical aspects expressed by Hack index (SL) to the spatial distribution of species, since the models with the best performances were those that considered the Hack index (SL) as one of the environmental layers of the mussel's niche.

abstract={Dreissena spp. (zebra and quagga mussels) are invasive to North America and increase light to the benthos, provide hard structure for algal attachment, and may contribute limiting nutrients to benthic algae, thereby facilitating algal blooms. We conducted experiments to determine how Dreissena affect nutrient stoichiometry and growth of Lyngbya wollei and Cladophora glomerata, two benthic algal species recently increasing in biomass in parts of the Laurentian Great Lakes, combined with a field survey to determine the likelihood of L. wollei co-occurrence with Dreissena. L. wollei had a significantly higher concentration of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and sulfur when grown with live Dreissena. C. glomerata had greater biomass in tanks with live Dreissena, but did not have significant increases in nutrient concentration like L. wollei did. Neither algal species increased in growth due to the added structure of Dreissena shells. L. wollei biomass was greater in the presence of Dreissena during 1 year (of two) of our field survey. This field survey also showed that L. wollei and Dreissena are likely to co-occur. These results suggest that Dreissena provide several nutrients to benthic algae, and these added resources can promote algal growth and consequently blooms.},

abstract={Temperature, salinity, and aerial exposure tolerances of the invasive green mussel, Perna viridis, were investigated under environmentally realistic conditions to address potential competition with native oysters, Crassostrea virginica. This study demonstrated that green mussels exhibit a temperature tolerance range similar to that of its native range (13-30 A degrees C), thereby limiting northern spread of south Florida populations. Salinity tolerances as low as 6 were observed during gradual decreases; however, acute changes resulted in low survival at salinities of 15 and below. At low salinities, even when survival was high, reductions in normal behavior (byssal production and valve closure) were observed. Green mussel survival was significantly inhibited during aerial exposure across all temperatures, and mortality synergistically increased (60-80 \%) with increasing temperatures and exposure time. In contrast, oysters demonstrated a parts per thousand yen97 \% survival over the exposure period at similar internal temperatures observed in green mussels. Internal temperatures for both species frequently exceeded 33 A degrees C, reaching temperatures as high as 41 A degrees C, while air temperatures averaged only 26.4 A +/- 1.6 A degrees C. Our results suggest that while Florida green mussel populations exhibit relatively broad temperature and salinity ranges, their spread is limited by the available subtidal habitat, potentially sparing intertidal oyster reefs from habitat and nutrient competition.},

abstract={Issue Title: Emerging Trends in Aquatic Ecology Humans have effectively transported thousands of species around the globe and, with accelerated trade; the rate of introductions has increased over time. Aquatic ecosystems seem at particular risk from invasive species because of threats to biodiversity and human needs for water resources. Here, we review some known aspects of aquatic invasive species (AIS) and explore several new questions. We describe impacts of AIS, factors limiting their dispersal, and the role that humans play in transporting AIS. We also review the characteristics of species that should be the greatest threat for future invasions, including those that pave the way for invasions by other species ("invasional meltdown"). Susceptible aquatic communities, such as reservoirs, may serve as stepping stones for invasions of new landscapes. Some microbes disperse long distance, infect new hosts and grow in the external aquatic medium, a process that has consequences for human health. We also discuss the interaction between species invasions and other human impacts (climate change, landscape conversion), as well as the possible connection of invasions with regime shifts in lakes. Since many invaders become permanent features of the environment, we discuss how humans live with invasive species, and conclude with questions for future research.},

title={Integrating landscape connectivity and habitat suitability to guide offensive and defensive invasive species management},
abstract={Preventing the arrival of invasive species is the most effective way of controlling their impact. Preventative strategies may be 'offensive' aimed at preventing the invader leaving colonised locations or 'defensive' aimed at preventing its arrival at uninvaded locations. The limited resources for invasive species control must be prioritized, particularly for numerous vulnerable locations or uncertainty about which sites are already invaded.We developed an integrative modelling framework to prioritise locations for either strategy by incorporating connectivity and habitat suitability. We applied this framework to a data set comprising 5189 water bodies in Wisconsin and Michigan, U.S.A, for zebra mussels Dreissena polymorpha and Eurasian watermilfoil Myriophyllum spicatum. We developed the framework with a spatial graph based on recreational boater movement and habitat suitability models.An historical graph comprised 3105 natural lakes connected in one of 18 components, whereas a total of 3944 water bodies (lakes and reservoirs) were connected in one of 13 separate components in a graph of the contemporary system. Habitat suitability models accounted for around half of the deviance in the distribution data for each species.There was a distinct spatial pattern in the levels of risk and subsequent recommended allocation of management interventions across several levels of investment. Higher risk water bodies were generally found in the largest component of the spatial graph. At comparatively low levels of investment, where managers target 5% of all locales to control D. polymorpha, the results suggested that 71% and 27% of this effort should be committed to defensive and offensive strategies, respectively, in the largest component. For M. spicatum, 92% and 8% of this effort should be allocated in this component to defensive and offensive strategies, respectively. It is only with much greater investment that water bodies in other components should be targeted.Synthesis and applications. Allocating limited resources to prevent the spread of invasive species is a challenge that transcends ecosystems and geography. We successfully identified a reduced number of locations to target for offensive and defensive intervention strategies for two species. This framework is readily applicable to other aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems vulnerable to invasive species.

title={Predicting the spread of aquatic invaders: insight from 200 years of invasion by zebra mussels},
abstract={Understanding factors controlling the introduction and spread of species is crucial to improving the management of both natural populations and introduced species. The zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, is considered the most aggressive freshwater invader in the Northern Hemisphere, and is a convenient model system for invasion biology, offering one of the best aquatic examples for examining the invasion process. We used data on 553 of the 1040 glacial lakes in the Republic of Belarus that were examined for the presence of zebra mussels. We used these data to build, test, and construct modified models to predict the spread of this invader, including selection of important parameters that could limit the spread of this invader. In spite of 200 years of continuous invasion, by 1996, zebra mussels were found in only 16.8\% of all lakes studied. Of those lakes without zebra mussels in 1996, 66\% were predicted to be susceptible to invasion by zebra mussels in the future, and 33\% were predicted to be immune to successful invasion due to their water chemistry. Eighty lakes free of zebra mussels in 1996 were reexamined from 1997 to 2008. Of these, zebra mussels successfully invaded an additional 31 lakes, all of which were classified initially as suitable for zebra mussels; none of the lakes previously classified as unsuitable were invaded. We used the Random Forests classification algorithm with 16 environmental variables to determine the most important factors that differed between invaded lakes and those lakes suitable for invasion that have not yet been invaded. Distance to the nearest infested lakes was found to be the most important variable, followed by the lake area, color, average depth, and concentration of chloride, magnesium, and bicarbonate. This study provides a useful approach for predicting the spread of an invader across a landscape with variable habitat suitability that can be applied to a variety of species and systems.},

Deliberate introductions, escapes, and hitchhiking with global commerce transport species to other continents. While most species fail to thrive or have minor impacts on their new ecosystems, the large number of introductions has led to numerous problems. Aquatic invasive species are particularly pervasive and may cause food web disruption, biodiversity loss, and economic harm. Biological invasions appear in an increasing number of publications in the aquatic and general ecology literature. This special issue of Hydrobiologia includes 31 papers on aquatic invasive species and the factors that influence their dispersal and success, along with their impacts. Ecosystems include freshwater ponds, lakes and reservoirs, small streams and large rivers, and coastal marine systems. Study regions occur in temperate, as well as less-studied tropical and sub-tropical regions of four different continents.

abstract={Issue Title: Aquatic Invasive Species Dreissena polymorpha (zebra mussel) and D. rostriformis bugensis (quagga mussel) continue to spread in Europe and in North America, and have large ecological and economic impacts where they invade. Today many more waterbodies are invaded by zebra mussels, and therefore the extent of their impact is greater than that of quagga mussels. Both species provide additional space and food for invertebrates in the littoral zone, increasing their diversity and density. In contrast, in the profundal zone, quagga mussels may compete for space and food resources with benthic invertebrates, decreasing their diversity and density. The system-wide effect of dreissenids depends on water mixing rates, lake morphology, and turnover rates. Because quagga mussels are found in all regions of a lake, and form larger populations, they may filter larger volumes of water and may have greater system-wide effects, especially in deep lakes, than zebra mussels, which are restricted to shallower portions of lakes. Shortly after initial invasion, as populations increase, both dreissenids will have their largest effects on communities, and most of them will be direct effects. After the initial stage of invasion, impacts are less predictable, and more likely to be caused by indirect effects through changes in the ecosystem.},

Our objective was to determine the factors that influence illegal introductions of non-native largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) and to develop a model that could be used to predict the pattern of future illegal introduction by anglers. We used generalized linear modeling (GLM) to evaluate the relationship between landscape and environmental factors and the presence of bass in farm ponds. Our results suggest that the occurrence of bass was primarily associated with pond size, distance of ponds from the urban center, and the proportion of the pond shoreline covered with a concrete revetment. We conclude that introductions occurred in ponds that were: easier to locate on a map, closer to anglers' residential areas, and more easily accessible to the pond shore. Last, we suggest our predictive model could be used for preventive measures, such as identifying other ponds most at risk of future illegal introduction of non-native bass.},

title={Making the Best of a Pest: The Potential for Using Invasive Zebra Mussel (Dreissena Polymorpha) Biomass as a Supplement to Commercial Chicken Feed},
abstract={Invasive non-native species frequently occur in very high densities. When such invaders present an economic or ecological nuisance, this biomass is typically removed and landfill is the most common destination, which is undesirable from both an economic and ecological perspective. The zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, has invaded large parts of Europe and North America, and is routinely removed from raw water systems where it creates a biofouling nuisance. We investigated the suitability of dried, whole zebra mussels as a supplement to poultry feed, thus providing a more attractive end-use than disposal to landfill. Measurable outcomes were nutrient and energy composition analyses of the feeds and production parameters of the birds over a 14 day period. Zebra mussels were a palatable feed supplement for chickens. The mussel meal contained high levels of calcium (344.9 g kg super(-1)), essential for egg shell formation, which was absorbed and retained easily by the birds. Compared with standard feed, a mussel-supplemented diet caused no significant effects on production parameters such as egg weight and feed conversion ratio during the study period. However, protein and energy levels in the zebra mussel feed were much lower than expected from the literature. In order for zebra mussels to be a viable long-term feed supplement for poultry, flesh would need to be separated from the shells in an economically viable way. If zebra mussels were to be used with the shells remaining, it seems that the resultant mussel meal would be more suitable as a calcium supplement.},

abstract={Issue Title: Biology and Conservation of Freshwater Bivalves Dreissena polymorpha (zebra mussel) is a freshwater bivalve mollusc and has been present for more than one decade in Spain. The zebra mussel causes serious ecological and socioeconomic impacts in areas where they settle. Our research aims to analyze its hydraulic habitat, developing physical models for this species, which indicates its preference and optimal microhabitat requirements. To get it, a survey was completed in a lotic reach in the lower Ebro River (Tarragona, Spain). Habitat suitability curves for the variables include water velocity, depth, Froude number, velocity/depth ratio, shear stress and shear stress ratio (RSS). In addition, interactive effects between hydraulic parameters on habitat selection and its use were studied and bivariate habitat models were developed. A close relationship was observed between the D. polymorpha presence and mean flow velocity combined with depth, Froude number and RSS. Suitable habitat requirements for Dreissena were detected in areas with stable river beds under high flows, and velocity below 1.2 m/s with a depth of less than 5 m under regular flows. Information about zebra mussel preferences may enhance the design of monitoring programmes and the integrated control management of this invasive mussel.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={The zebra mussel, a non-indigenous species in North American freshwater ecosystems, has received significant attention over the past two decades as a costly and damaging invader. In the USA, federal-, state-, and local-level policies designed to control and/or prevent the spread of this species remain flawed, in that they do not everywhere account for (or enforce regulations over) all potential anthropogenic dispersal pathways. Ballast water discharge is well-known as an important vector in the dispersal of aquatic invasive species in general, but for the zebra mussel its effects as a source of transmission have rarely been investigated. This article uses simple econometric techniques to measure the relationship between zebra mussel invasion in US states and domestic commercial navigation. Coefficient estimates suggest that incoming waterborne shipments from invaded states are an important determinant of the level of zebra mussel invasion in the receiving state. In designing a comprehensive framework for combating the spread of zebra mussels across US freshwater ecosystems, policy-makers may need to more carefully consider the monitoring and treatment of commercial ships' ballast water discharges as potentially effective strategies.},

abstract={Populations of invasive species tend to have fewer parasites in their introduced ranges than in their native ranges and are also thought to have fewer parasites than native prey. This 'release' from parasites has unstudied implications for native predators feeding on exotic prey. In particular, shifts from native to exotic prey should reduce levels of trophically transmitted parasites. We tested this hypothesis in native populations of pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus) in Lake Opinicon, where fish stomach contents were studied intensively in the 1970s, prior to the appearance of exotic zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) in the mid-1990s. Zebra mussels were common in stomachs of present-day pumpkinseeds, and stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen confirmed their importance in long-term diets. Because historical parasite data were not available in Lake Opinicon, we also surveyed stomach contents and parasites in pumpkinseed in both Lake Opinicon and an ecologically similar, neighboring lake where zebra mussels were absent. Stomach contents of pumpkinseed in the companion lake did not differ from those of pre-invasion fish from Lake Opinicon. The companion lake, therefore, served as a surrogate "pre-invasion" reference to assess effects of zebra mussel consumption on parasites in pumpkinseed. Trophically transmitted parasites were less species-rich and abundant in Lake Opinicon, where fish fed on zebra mussels, although factors other than zebra mussel consumption may contribute to these differences. Predation on zebra mussels has clearly contributed to a novel trophic coupling between littoral and pelagic food webs in Lake Opinicon.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Novel Proteins Identified in the Insoluble Byssal Matrix of the Freshwater Zebra Mussel},
abstract={The freshwater zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, is an invasive, biofouling species that adheres to a variety of substrates underwater, using a proteinaceous anchor called the byssus. The byssus consists of a number of threads with adhesive plaques at the tips. It contains the unusual amino acid 3, 4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), which is believed to play an important role in adhesion, in addition to providing structural integrity to the byssus through cross-linking. Extensive DOPA cross-linking, however, renders the zebra mussel byssus highly resistant to protein extraction, and therefore limits byssal protein identification. We report here on the identification of seven novel byssal proteins in the insoluble byssal matrix following protein extraction from induced, freshly secreted byssal threads with minimal cross-linking. These proteins were identified by LC-MS/MS analysis of tryptic digests of the matrix proteins by spectrum matching against a zebra mussel cDNA library of genes unique to the mussel foot, the organ that secretes the byssus. All seven proteins were present in both the plaque and thread. Comparisons of the protein sequences revealed common features of zebra mussel byssal proteins, and several recurring sequence motifs. Although their sequences are unique, many of the proteins display similarities to marine mussel byssal proteins, as well as to adhesive and structural proteins from other species. The large expansion of the byssal proteome reported here represents an important step towards understanding zebra mussel adhesion.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={The tubenose goby, Proterorhinus semilunaris, has expanded its range throughout Europe. Comprehensive studies to identify its impact on native riverine ecosystems, however, are relatively scarce. Here, we evaluate dietary preferences of P. semilunaris on a non-native river to reveal any such impacts. Fish were sampled monthly over 2011<e2><80><93>2012 from three sites along the River Dyje (Czech Republic; Danube basin) with differing population levels and food availability. Both the amount of food consumed and dietary composition varied seasonally, with site having a strong effect. Food consumed differed between males and females, but not dietary composition; while diet differed between age classes, but not food consumed. In general, Trichoptera, Chironomidae and zooplankton dominated the diet at all sites, with Trichoptera taken more often earlier in the year and zooplankton later. Mussels were always avoided, despite high abundance, while less preferred prey were occasionally taken in high numbers in response to increased availability or energy demand (e.g. spawning). Fish eggs and fry (all P. semilunaris) were only taken in high numbers at one site, being related to high population level and fry drift from a reservoir. Male feeding declined over the breeding season, presumably due to nest guarding, while female feeding declined over winter, possibly resulting in high mortality. Proterorhinus semilunaris is a feeding opportunist, which may facilitate colonisation in habitats with poor prey availability. No predation pressure on native species was observed through consumption of eggs or fry, though small/young indigenous fish may be affected through diet competition.Alternate abstract:Le gobie demi-lune, Proterorhinus semilunaris, a <c3><a9>largi son aire de r<c3><a9>partition <c3><a0> travers l<e2><80><99>Europe.

title={Rapid range expansion of the invasive quagga mussel in relation to zebra mussel presence in The Netherlands and Western Europe},
abstract={Since its appearance in 2006 in a freshwater section of the Rhine-Meuse estuary (Hollandsch Diep, The Netherlands), the non-indigenous quagga mussel has displayed a rapid range expansion in Western Europe. However, an overview characterising the spread and impacts of the quagga mussel in this area is currently lacking. A literature study, supplemented with field data, was performed to gather all available data and information relating to quagga mussel dispersal. Dispersal characteristics were analysed for rate and direction and in relation to hydrological connectivity and dispersal vectors. To determine ranges of conditions suitable for quagga mussel colonisation, physico-chemical characteristics of their habitats were analysed. After its initial arrival in the freshwater section of the Rhine-Meuse estuary and River Danube, the quagga mussel demonstrated a rapid and continued range expansion in Western Europe. Quagga mussels have extended their non-native range to the network of major waterways in The Netherlands and in an upstream direction in the River Rhine (Germany), its tributaries (rivers Main and Moselle) and the River Meuse (Belgium and France). The calculated average quagga mussel dispersal rate in Europe was 120 km year(-1) (range 23-383 km year(-1)). Hydrological connectivity is important in determining the speed with which colonisation occurs. Dispersal to water bodies disconnected from the freshwater network requires the presence of a suitable vector e.g. pleasure boats transferred over land. Upstream dispersal is primarily human mediated through the attachment of mussels to watercraft. The relative abundance of quagga mussel to zebra mussel has greatly increased in a number of areas sampled in the major Dutch rivers and lakes and the rivers Main and Rhine and the Rhine-Danube Canal leading to a dominance shift from zebra mussels to quagga mussels. However, evidence for displacement of the zebra mussel is limited due to the lack of temporal trends relating to the overall density of zebra and quagga mussel.},

title={Predation on invasive zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, by pumpkinseed sunfish, rusty crayfish, and round goby},
abstract={The enemy release hypothesis states that invasive species are successful in their new environment because native species are not adapted to utilize the invasive. If true for predators, native predators should have lower feeding rates on the invasive species than a predator from the native range of the invasive species. We tested this hypothesis for zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) by comparing handling time and predation rate on zebra mussels in the laboratory by two North American species (pumpkinseed, Lepomis gibbosus, and rusty crayfish, Orconectes rusticus) and one predator with a long evolutionary history with zebra mussels (round goby, Neogobius melanostomus). Handling time per mussel (7 mm shell length) ranged from 25 to >70 s for the three predator species. Feeding rates on attached zebra mussels were higher for round goby than the two native predators. Medium and large gobies consumed 50-67 zebra mussels attached to stones in 24 h, whereas pumpkinseed and rusty crayfish consumed <11. This supports the hypothesis that the rapid spread of zebra mussels in North America was facilitated by low predation rates from the existing native predators. At these predation rates and realistic goby abundance estimates, round goby could affect zebra mussel abundance in some lakes.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Invasion ratcheting in the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) and the ability of native and invaded ranges to predict its global distribution},
abstract={AimIn this study, we investigate changes in the environmental niche of an important pest species, the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha), across its world-wide distribution. The ability of models based on the native (Ponto-Caspian) and invaded (Western European and North American) ranges to accurately model the potential distribution of zebra mussel elsewhere was also investigated. LocationEurope and North America. MethodsA comprehensive cross-continental occurrence database of the zebra mussel was used to explore the species' native and invaded ranges using univariate and multivariate analyses. In addition, ecological niche models (ENMs, employing MaxEnt) were used to investigate the ability of the native and invaded ranges to describe the species' distribution elsewhere. ResultsWe found the zebra mussel to occupy different, but partly overlapping, environmental niches in the native Ponto-Caspian region and invaded European and North American regions. Accordingly, the ENMs calibrated with the native range accurately predicted regions of early colonization in Europe and North America, but not the subsequent expansion. ENMs calibrated with data from the European range failed to describe the invaded range in North America, and vice versa. Climate suitability curves further confirmed a progressive spatio-temporal stretching of the climatic tolerance of the zebra mussel. Main conclusionsThis study provides novel evidence of multiple episodes of niche expansion in a notorious invasive species, and supports the use of partial ranges to better understand the species' spatio-temporal history of invasion. Separately, the native and invaded ranges provided important information regarding the species' environmental tolerance and the regions that are most suitable for first colonization, as well as identifying regions at risk in the case of a possible reintroduction. Collectively, the differences between the three ecological niche projections of the zebra mussel demonstrate that niche expansion of an invasive species within a new geographical region promotes the organism's further invasion in space and time, a process known as invasion ratcheting.},

title={Environmental factors shaping the distribution of common wintering waterbirds in a lake ecosystem with developed shoreline},
abstract={In this study, we tested whether the spatial distribution of waterbirds is influenced by shoreline urbanization or other habitat characteristics. We conducted monthly censuses along shoreline sections of a continental lake (Lake Balaton, Hungary) to assess the abundance of 11 common species that use this lake as a feeding and staging area during migration and winter. We estimated the degree of urbanization of the same shoreline sections and also measured other habitat characteristics (water depth, extent of reed cover, biomass of zebra mussels, distances to waste dumps and to other wetlands). We applied linear models and model averaging to identify habitat variables with high relative importance for predicting bird distributions. Bird abundance and urbanization were strongly related only in one species. Other habitat variables exhibited stronger relationships with bird distribution: (1) diving ducks and coots preferred shoreline sections with high zebra mussel biomass, (2) gulls preferred sites close to waste dumps, and (3) the abundances of several species were higher on shoreline sections close to other wetlands. Our findings suggest that the distribution of waterbirds on Lake Balaton is largely independent of shoreline urbanization and influenced by food availability and connectivity between wetlands.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Diet of Northern Map Turtles (Graptemys geographica): Sexual Differences and Potential Impacts of an Altered River System},
abstract={Alterations of flow regimen, pollution, and introductions of exotic species have significantly altered the composition of invertebrates in many river systems throughout the world. How these alterations affect the diet of higher level predators is not well understood. We studied the diet of the Northern Map Turtle (Graptemys geographica) In the damregulated Susquehanna River in north-central Maryland. Northern Map Turtles are a relatively large, top-order predator that is legally endangered in the state and is impacted by commercial collecting elsewhere. Gastropods, trlchopteran larvae, and invasive Corbicula sp. predominated across diet samples. Marked sexual and size-related differences occurred. Adult male G. geographica fed primarily on a group of small gastropod species (Planorbidae, Hydrobiidae, Physidae), trichopterans, and Corbicula, while adult females fed primarily on pleurocerid snails. There was virtually no overlap in the diets of the two sexes of G. geographica. This is of special conservation concern because two different groups of prey are needed in order to support this population of Northern Map Turtles, and many North American pleurocerid gastropod species are highly endangered and also threatened by hydroelectric activity. Our results are consistent with reports of other Map Turtle populations before the invasion of Zebra Mussels (Dreissena sp.), which often result in a sharp change in diet. Zebra Mussels have already been documented immediately upstream of our study site, so impacts from this invasive species may become apparent in the near future. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Genetic and phenoptypic differentiation of zebra mussel populations colonizing Spanish river basins},
abstract={Issue Title: Transgenerational and Evolutionary Responses in Environmental Species Zebra mussel populations in Ebro and Mijares Rivers (northern Spain) were analyzed to study the mechanisms by which this aquatic species deals with pollution. Variability analyses of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene and of one nuclear microsatellite were performed for ten populations from the Ebro River and one from the Mijares River. Comparison of these results with those from five additional European populations indicated that the Spanish populations constitute a homogeneous gene pool. Transcriptome analyses of gill samples from a subset of the Spanish populations showed changes on expression levels that correlated with variations in general fitness and loads of heavy metals. The less polluted upstream Ebro populations showed overexpression of mitochondrial and cell proliferation-related genes compared to the more polluted, downstream Ebro populations. Our data indicate that heavy metals were the main factors explaining these transcriptomic patterns, and that zebra mussel is resilient to pollutants (like mercury and organochlorine compounds) proved to be extremely toxic to vertebrates. We propose that zebra mussel populations sharing a common gene pool may acclimate to different levels and forms of pollution through modulations in their transcriptomic profile, although direct selection on genes showing differential expression patterns cannot be ruled out.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Indirect trophic interactions with an invasive species affect phenotypic divergence in a top consumer},
abstract={While phenotypic responses to direct species interactions are well studied, we know little about the consequences of indirect interactions for phenotypic divergence. In this study we used lakes with and without the zebra mussel to investigate effects of indirect trophic interactions on phenotypic divergence between littoral and pelagic perch. We found a greater phenotypic divergence between littoral and pelagic individuals in lakes with zebra mussels and propose a mussel-mediated increase in pelagic and benthic resource availability as a major factor underlying this divergence. Lakes with zebra mussels contained higher densities of large plankton taxa and large invertebrates. We suggest that this augmented resource availability improved perch foraging opportunities in both the littoral and pelagic zones. Perch in both habitats could hence express a more specialized foraging morphology, leading to an increased divergence of perch forms in lakes with zebra mussels. As perch do not prey on mussels directly, we conclude that the increased divergence results from indirect interactions with the mussels. Our results hence suggest that species at lower food web levels can indirectly affect phenotypic divergence in species at the top of the food chain.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Inputs of chemical constituents to the system are determined in large part by inflows in the north from Lake Michigan and Lake Superior, the latter via the St Marys River, and inputs from Saginaw Bay in the south. As a result, water-quality characteristics in Lake Huron are intermediate between the other two upper lakes. The Great Lakes National Program Office of the US Environmental Protection Agency has conducted regular biannual monitoring of the main basin of Lake Huron since 1983. The monitoring effort is focused on detecting whole-lake responses to changes in loadings of anthropogenic substances as well as impacts of invasive species, so sampling is restricted largely to the relatively homogeneous offshore waters of the main basin.},

title={Impacts of dreissenid mussel invasions on chlorophyll and total phosphorus in 25 lakes in the USA},
abstract={Summary 1.Invasions of zebra and quagga mussels have had long-term, large-scale impacts on lake ecosystems in the USA as characterised by high abundance, broad-scale spread and effective adaption to new environmental conditions. Due to their high filtering capacity, decreases in chlorophyll a (Chl) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations have been reported in many affected lakes. 2.In 25 US lakes, we analysed the effects of dreissenid invasions on changes in Chl and TP concentrations, measured as the probability of a concentration decrease in the post-invasion period and changes in Chl-TP relationships using Bayesian hierarchical regressions. We also examined whether changes in Chl and TP concentrations and in the Chl-TP relationship differed according to lake hydromorphology, such as mean depth or mixing status (mixed versus stratified lakes). 3.Our results showed that dreissenid invasions were often, but not always, associated with subsequent TP and Chl declines. Dreissenid effects on Chl and TP may be influenced by lake thermal structure. Decreases in Chl and TP were consistently found in mixed lakes where benthic-pelagic coupling is tight, while the effects were less predictable in stratified lakes. Within stratified lakes, Chl and TP reductions were more clearly discernible in deeper lakes with long water residence times. 4.Regression results demonstrated that a joint increase in slope and decrease in intercept and a tighter correlation of the Chl-TP relationship were likely to occur in dreissenid-invaded lakes; this does not support the idea of a shift from bottom-up to top-down control of primary production. These results have important implications for management, suggesting that a relaxation of TP standards would be unwarranted. 5.Across lakes, the slope of the Chl-TP relationship for mixed lakes was substantially higher than that for stratified lakes before mussel invasion, indicating an important role of light in limiting primary production. The slope differences between mixed and stratified lakes decreased in the post-invasion period, possibly because mussel filtration results in a relaxation of light limitation that is more pronounced in deeper, stratified lakes.

title={Interrelations between Dreissena polymorpha colonization and autotrophic periphyton development - a field study in a temperate floodplain lake},
abstract={Temporal changes in autotrophic periphyton (algae and cyanobacteria) in relation to the colonization of Dreissena polymorpha, an invasive species, were investigated in situ using artificial substrata (glass slides) from April to August of 2008 in a Danubian floodplain. The colonization of cyanobacteria and planktonic diatoms firmly attached to the substrata followed by the development of apical pad forming diatoms and stalk forming diatoms, resulted in the rapid formation of a three-dimensional structure of periphyton. Increasing water temperatures, together with the well developed autotrophic periphyton, supported the colonization of Dreissena. A total of 16 size classes of Dreissena were found during the gradual mussel community development. The community most likely formed from the initially settled larvae which dominated the first period of aggregation, while adult individuals dominated the later phase, contributing to the increase in habitat complexity. High competition for space and nutrients on small-size substrata limited the autotrophic periphyton to achieve the ``climax community{''}characterized by filamentous green algae. Consequently, algal abundance decreased and diatoms firmly attached to the substrata prevailed. The decrease in mussel abundance at the end of the colonization experiment enabled a gradual increase in diatom abundance and redevelopment of a three-dimensional autotrophic periphyton structure. Altogether, our results showed that dense coverage of hard surfaces by mussels may have negatively influenced the algal community causing a significant decrease in algal abundance and a shift to the dominance of species resistant to the disturbance.},

title={Risk assessment for three Dreissenid mussels (Dreissena polymorpha, Dreissena rostriformis bugensis, and Mytilopsis leucophaeata) in Canadian freshwater ecosystems},
abstract={An ecological risk assessment for three dreissenid mussel species: the Zebra Mussel (Dreissena polymorpha); the Quagga Mussel (D. rostriformis bugensis); and the Dark Falsemussel (Mytilopsis leucopheata) was conducted for freshwater ecosystems in the western Canadian provinces, Ontario, and Quebec. This risk assessment considered probabilities of survival (habitat suitability) and arrival to 108 Canadian sub-drainages and the ecological impacts associated with these species. The ecological risk associated with both zebra mussel and quagga mussel invasions across the western provinces and watersheds directly adjacent to the Laurentian Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River was considered high. In contrast, the risk was considered low for most of eastern Ontario and Quebec where calcium concentrations were deemed too low to support large (invasive) populations. Due to the high salinity requirements of dark falsemussel, the ecological risk associated with this species was considered low for all Canadian freshwater ecosystems. However, the scope of this risk assessment did not consider coastal estuarine habitats where the ecological risk could be substantially higher. The largest ecological impacts associated with zebra mussel and quagga mussel were negative impacts on biota that inhabit the pelagic (offshore) zones of lakes or rivers (e.g., losses in productivity for phytoplankton, zooplankton, and planktivorous fishes), and to unionid mussels (severe declines in abundance and biodiversity).Original Abstract: Une evaluation des risques ecologiques poses par trois especes de moules dreissenidees : la moule zebree (Dreissena polymorpha), la moule quagga (D. rostriformis bugensis) et la moule d'Amerique (Mytilopsis leucopheata) a ete menee pour les ecosystemes d'eau douce des provinces de l'Ouest canadien, de l'Ontario et du Quebec. La presente evaluation des risques s'est penchee sur les probabilites de survie (habitats propices) et d'arrivee de ces especes dans 108 sous-bassins versants canadiens ainsi que leurs impacts ecologiques. D'apres l'evaluation, les risques ecologiques lies aux invasions de la moule zebree et de la moule quagga dans les provinces et les bassins-versants de l'Ouest situes directement a cote des Grands Lacs laurentiens et du fleuve Saint-Laurent seraient eleves. En revanche, on a juge que le risque etait faible pour la majeure partie de l'Ontario et du Quebec, ou les concentrations de calcium ont ete considerees comme trop faibles pour soutenir de grandes populations (envahissantes). En raison des exigences elevees de la moule d'Amerique en matiere de salinite, on considere que le risque ecologique lie a cette espece est faible pour l'ensemble des ecosystemes d'eau douce au Canada. Toutefois, les habitats cotiers estuariennes, ou le risque ecologique pourrait etre beaucoup plus eleve, ne faisaient pas l'objet de la presente evaluation. Les impacts ecologiques les plus importants de la moule zebree et de la moule quagga sont les effets negatifs sur le biote vivant dans les zones pelagiques (extracotieres) des lacs et des rivieres (p. ex., pertes de productivite du phytoplancton, du zooplancton et des poissons planctonophages) et sur les unionides (declins considerables de l'abondance et de la biodiversite).},

title={Historic nutrient loading and recent species invasions caused shifts in water quality and zooplankton demography in two Finger Lakes (New York, USA)},
abstract={We investigated the paleolimnology of Owasco and Seneca Lakes (New York, USA) and compiled water-quality monitoring data to describe environmental change during the past two centuries. Trophic shifts were detected in the oligotrophic to mesotrophic range and were likely driven by nutrient loading and species invasion. Based on box core reconstructions, primary production increased in both lakes during the last century, which is evidenced by the amount, type and isotopic composition of material preserved in the sediment. Organic matter accumulation and its stable carbon isotopic composition, as well as carbonate abundance, began to increase during the 1960s in Owasco Lake and the 1850s in Seneca Lake. Further, the abundance of phytoplanktivorous cladocera subfossils increased beginning in the 1910s in Seneca Lake and in the 1960s in Owasco Lake. The different timing and magnitude of the trophic shifts likely resulted from contrasts in lake residence time and species assemblages between the two lakes. The increases in primary and secondary production paralleled, and are interpreted to reflect, increased allochthonous nutrient loading. However, nutrient loading was not detected in the water-quality data, perhaps because of strong uptake of phosphates by phytoplankton or due to limited data collection. Rapid changes in cladoceran subfossils and water quality were also detected during the last decade. Concurrent with the establishment of non-native Cercopagis pengoi (fishhook waterflea), phytoplanktivorous cladocera remains declined, and the mucrone length of Bosmina increased, consistent with predictions of increased invertebrate predation. Additionally, the post-1990 decline in sediment carbonate, increased Secchi depth and decreased chlorophyll a concentrations followed the establishment of filter-feeding Dreissena spp. (zebra and quagga mussels). Collectively, paleolimnological data and water-quality monitoring provided a more complete and consistent record of shifts in the productivity of Owasco and Seneca Lakes, which were useful to understand environmental changes over different time scales. Physical, geochemical and biological changes were temporally consistent among three cores collected from different locations in each lake, but differed in magnitude for several variables (e.g., grain size and cladoceran subfossils), which could reflect near-shore to offshore gradients.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={An indirect effect of biological invasions: the effect of zebra mussel fouling on parasitisation of unionid mussels by bitterling fish},
abstract={Invasive species represent a major threat with both direct and indirect effects on natural ecosystems, including effects on established and coevolved relationships. In a series of experiments, we examined how the interaction between two native species, a unionid mussel (Unio pictorum) and the European bitterling (Rhodeus amarus), a fish that parasitises unionids, was affected by the non-native zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha). The zebra mussel fouls hard substrates, including shells of living unionids, and its presence is often associated with a decrease in population density of native unionid mussels. Bitterling lay their eggs into live unionids and the embryos develop inside their gills. Using a range of zebra mussel densities, we demonstrated that zebra mussel fouling had a negative effect on the number of bitterling eggs inside the mussel host, with abundances of 5-10 zebra mussels (shell size 15-25<c2><a0>mm) per unionid critical for bitterling ability to utilise the host. In a further experiment, we found that bitterling did not discriminate between unfouled unionids and those fouled with five zebra mussels. Most ovipositions into fouled hosts, however, were unsuccessful as eggs failed to reach the unionid gills. We discuss implications of such unsuccessful ovipositions for bitterling recruitment and population dynamics.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Behavioural changes of zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha (Bivalvia) induced by Ponto-Caspian gammarids},
abstract={Colonies of an invasive Ponto-Caspian zebra mussel constitute suitable habitats for many invertebrate organisms, including Ponto-Caspian gammarids that are now spreading throughout Europe. There is, however, little known of the impact of these gammarids on their mussel hosts which they live amongst. We studied the behaviour of zebra mussels in the presence of three gammarid species that differed in their origin and degree of association with Dreissena habitats. In the presence of the Ponto-Caspian invader Dikerogammarus villosus that was commonly observed in mussel habitats, mussels responded by increasing their attachment strength and reducing upward movement. The responses to the Ponto-Caspian Pontogammarus robustoides, a species that showed no preferences for mussel habitats, were weaker and limited to the increase of attachment strength. There were no behavioural changes in mussels exposed to the native Gammarus fossarum. As mussels only responded to gammarids moving freely among their shells and not to those kept behind a mesh barrier, the most likely factor causing these changes was mechanical irritation of their soft parts by amphipod appendages. This hypothesis was further confirmed in an additional experiment with a South-American catfish Corydoras paleatus used as another potential source of mechanical irritation. The responses of zebra mussels to gammarids were similar to their anti-predator defences shown earlier in the presence of molluscivorous roach. Thus, it appears likely that Ponto Caspian gammarids within mussel colonies have the capacity to compromise the normal functioning of bivalves through inducing their defensive responses.},

title={Trends of total cadmium, copper, and zinc in the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) along the upper reach of the St. Lawrence River: 1994--2005},
abstract={This study examines spatial and temporal variability of bioaccumulation of cadmium, copper, and zinc in tissues of zebra mussels in the upper reach of the St. Lawrence River which originates at the outflow of Lake Ontario. It was hypothesized that concentrations of these metals in mussel tissues would decline over time and decrease with increasing distance from the outlet of Lake Ontario as a result of on-going efforts to reduce contaminant discharges into the lake. Size of mussels was also evaluated as a factor influencing bioaccumulation. Mussels were collected annually in October from six sites from 1994 to 2005, including one site near a local industry. Individuals were grouped into five or more size classes per site in each year. Soft tissues were analyzed for total cadmium, copper and zinc. Concentrations of cadmium and copper in tissues varied significantly both spatially and temporally. Cadmium concentrations were elevated at most sites; copper concentrations were moderately elevated compared with other studies in the Lake Ontario basin and St. Lawrence River. Zinc showed the most uniformity in mussels possibly due to internal regulation and to low levels of environmental exposure. Animal size correlated with copper concentrations of tissues in approximately 30% of samples but infrequently for cadmium and zinc. Cadmium and copper levels were found to decline downstream over time. Inter-annual variability of metal concentrations in mussel tissues suggests utilization in long-term monitoring programs to discern significant trends. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Biological and ecological mechanisms for overcoming sperm limitation in invasive dreissenid mussels},
abstract={Many broadcast-spawning benthic invertebrates are subject to sperm limitation yet achieve high population densities, as for example dreissenid mussels (Dreissena polymorpha and Dreisssena bugensis) that were introduced into the Laurentian Great Lakes. The question remains whether biological or ecological/physical mechanisms reduce sperm limitation. Gamete dilution/longevity experiments were undertaken to determine whether dreissenid mussels are subject to sperm limitation, and computational fluid dynamic modeling was used to determine the potential influence of bottom roughness on sperm dilution in nature. Results indicated that dreissenid mussels may be sperm limited, but the extent to which sperm dilution affects them is lower than what was reported for other broadcast spawning invertebrates. Importantly, model mussel clusters influenced external fertilization by retaining sperm in downstream eddies but allowing downstream transport from one cluster to another. This, in addition to high sperm potency at low sperm concentrations, may help to explain the success of dreissenid mussels as invasive species.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Low dissolved ions may limit secondary invasion of inland waters by exotic round gobies and dreissenid mussels in North America},
abstract={Round gobies and dreissenid mussels, exotic species in the North American Great Lakes basin, are euryhaline organisms whose geographic spread and ecological impacts in freshwaters may be limited by low levels of dissolved ions such as calcium (Ca). We measured source populations of these exotics in the St. Lawrence River and found population densities of dreissenids (range of similar to 1,000-6,400 individuals m super(-2)) and round gobies (6-32 individuals m super(-2)) similar to those in other Great Lake locations from which they have spread inland. However, we found little evidence for their secondary invasion of inland tributary rivers and lakes of northern New York State. Using natural waters collected from inland ecosystems, we ran laboratory bioassays of reproduction, growth, and survival of several life stages of zebra and quagga mussels as well as the round goby. We found little difference in the responses of zebra and quagga mussels, with each species showing moderate reproductive success, growth, and survival at Ca concentrations > 13 mg L super(-1) and dramatic improvements at >18 mg L super(-1). Round gobies showed moderate survival in waters with Ca concentrations > 8 mg L super(-1) and high survival > 18 mg L super(-1). These bioassays are the first such experiments for quagga mussels and round gobies and show how all three species may be similarly restricted in their ability to invade and permanently colonize significant geographic regions of New York State and perhaps the US.},

title={Effects of invasive zebra mussels on phytoplankton, turbidity, and dissolved nutrients in reservoirs},
abstract={Few experiments have quantified the effects of invasive zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) on man-made reservoirs relative to other aquatic habitats. Reservoirs, however, are the dominate water body type in many of the states that are at the current front of the zebra mussel invasion into the western United States. The objective of this research, therefore, was to determine how zebra mussels affected phytoplankton, turbidity, and dissolved nutrients in water that was collected from three Kansas reservoirs that varied in trophic state (mesotrophic to hypereutrophic), but all experienced frequent cyanobacterial blooms. Laboratory mesocosm experiments were conducted to document the effects of zebra mussels on cyanobacteria and general water quality characteristics in the reservoir water. Zebra mussels significantly reduced algal biomass, and the total biovolume of cyanobacteria (communities were dominated by Anabaena) in each reservoir experiment. The effects of zebra mussels on other major algal groups (diatoms, flagellates, and green algae) and algal diversity were less consistent and varied between the three reservoir experiments. Similarly, the effects of zebra mussels on nutrient concentrations varied between experiments. Zebra mussels increased dissolved phosphorus concentrations in two of the reservoir experiments, but there was no effect of zebra mussels on dissolved phosphorus in the mesotrophic reservoir experiment. Combined, our results strongly suggest that zebra mussels have the potential to significantly impact reservoirs as they continue to expand throughout the western United States. Moreover, the magnitude of these effects may be context dependent and vary depending on the trophic state and/or resident phytoplankton communities of individual reservoirs as has similarly been reported for natural lakes.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Density effects on the clearance rate of the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha: flume study results},
abstract={Zebra mussel filtration rates and regulating factors have been addressed earlier in a number of studies. Still, only a few of them have taken into consideration the refiltration phenomenon, and therefore the direct extrapolation of experimental results may only give the potential filtering capacity, and hence, over- or underestimate the actual amount of seston being removed by zebra mussels in an ecosystem. The current experimental study aimed to gain insight into the refiltration effect on the clearance rate of the zebra mussels at relatively high seston concentrations, and its potential role in controlling the filtration efficiency of the zebra mussel population. The experiment was conducted in a laboratory flume following the Latin squares design with one fixed (mussel density) and three random factors (initial total particulate matter (TPM) concentration, flume "wall effect" and distance from the flume inflow area) considered. The results showed the significant effects of mussel density and the TPM concentration on the effective clearance rate (ECR) of zebra mussels. The higher ECR values were obtained at denser mussel clumps and lower TPM concentrations. The flume "wall effect" had no significant effect on the ECR, whereas the distance from the flume inflow area appeared to have a significant impact. A positive relationship between ECR and the zebra mussel density was most evident in the proximity of the TPM source. Based on the results, we assume that at high TPM concentration, refiltration may assert itself by the elevated net clearance rate of mussels within dense clumps compared to that of mussels at relatively low individual densities. This should be taken into consideration while modelling and assessing the role of the zebra mussel in energy flow and redistribution of organic matter in an ecosystem.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Science advice from the risk assessment of three dreissenid mussels (Dreissena polymorpha, Dreissena rostriformis bugensis, and Mytilopsis leucophaeata) in Canadian freshwater ecosystems},
abstract={In freshwater and some estuarine ecosystems, two prominent dreissenid mussels, the Zebra Mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) and Quagga Mussel (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis), both native to the PontoCaspian region, have a long history of invasion in both Europe and North America. Further, a related dreissenid mussel species, the Dark Falsemussel (also known as Conrad's Falsemussel) (Mytilopsis leucopheata), has expanded its range to brackish water habitats across Europe and North America. Dreissenid mussels have had disproportionately large economic and ecological impacts due to their ability for rapid dispersal within and across continents, resulting in severe negative impacts on food webs and nutrient processing. Given the potential for non-indigenous species to have substantial negative impacts on Canadian ecosystems as well as the steady migration west, several western provinces requested Fisheries and Oceans Canada (through the Centre of Expertise for Aquatic Risk Assessment (CEARA)) to undertake a national risk assessment to determine the potential risk posed by three species of dreissenid mussels to Canadian aquatic ecosystems. This risk assessment considered probabilities of survival (habitat suitability) and arrival to 108 Canadian sub-drainages and the ecological impacts associated with these species. The ecological risk posed by these species was decided at a workshop meeting based on a draft risk assessment using an established Risk Matrix that combines the probability of invasion and the impacts on the environment. This risk assessment provides science-based guidance to resource managers for the development and implementation of management options. This Science Advisory Report is from the Peer Review meeting on the National Risk Assessment of Zebra Mussel, Quagga Mussel and Dark Falsemussel held on March 27-28, 2012 in Winnipeg, Manitoba.

abstract={In freshwater and some estuarine ecosystems, the Zebra Mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) and Quagga Mussel (D. rostriformis bugenis), both native to the Ponto-Caspian Region of Eastern Europe, have a long history of invasion in aquatic ecosystems in both Europe and North America. These two species were introduced to the Great Lakes in the mid-1980s as a result of ballast water discharge from ships. These mussels have rapidly dispersed throughout the Great Lakes region into river systems and smaller lakes. As well, a closely related dreissenid mussel species, the Dark Falsemussel (Mytilopsis leucophaeta), was identified on a boat being trailered across western Canada, raising concerns that this species could also pose a risk to Canadian freshwater ecosystems and was also evaluated in this risk assessment. Dreissenid Mussels have had significant environmental and socio-economic impacts due to their ability for rapid dispersal, resulting in severe negative impacts on food webs and nutrient processing. As a result of the significant impacts associated with these mussels as well as a steady movement west, several western provinces requested Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) (through Canada's Centre of Expertise in Risk Assessment, CEARA) to conduct a risk assessment for Zebra, Quagga and Dark FalseMussels. This risk assessment considered probabilities of survival (habitat suitability) and arrival to 108 Canadian sub-drainages and the ecological impacts associated with these species. The ecological risk posed by these species was determined using an established Risk Matrix. This risk assessment was peer reviewed as the key scientific working paper in a CSAS National Peer Review Process held on March 27 and 28, 2012 at the DFO Freshwater Institute in Winnipeg, Manitoba.

title={Submerged aquatic vegetation in the Bay of Quinte: Response to decreased phosphorous loading and Zebra Mussel invasion},
abstract={Originally mesotrophic, the Bay of Quinte ecosystem has experienced eutrophication since the 1940s, which resulted in the decline of once-lush submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) beds in the upper bay by the mid-1960s. Since 1972, twelve SAV surveys have been conducted along ten index transects, recording:\% cover, distance SAV beds extended from shore (extent), maximum depth of colonization (Zc), species composition, and, in later years, wet plant biomass. Offshore secchi depth and ?par, (the vertical light extinction rate (m-1) for photosynthetically active radiation), were also recorded either weekly or bi-weekly during the growing season since 1972. During this time, two major changes occurred within the bay: the reduction in point-source phosphorus (P-control) loadings in 1978 and the 1993 invasion by Dreissenid Mussel. SAV response to these changes varied temporally and spatially, with the shallow upper bay showing the greatest response, particularly after Zebra Mussels establishment. In the upper bay, mean secchi depth increased by 8\% from 1.2 m prior to P-control (pre-P), to 1.3 m after P-control (post-P) and further increased by 46\% to 1.9 m after Dreissena establishment (post-D). Upper bay SAV responded to these invasive species with increases in the means of three variables: Zc from 1.6 to 3.5 m, extent from 114 m to 417 m and wet biomass from 50 g m-2 to 962 g m-2. SAV in the middle and lower bays were in better condition in 1972, with pre-P cover in excess of 50\% and Zc of 2.6 and 3.7 m, respectively. SAV cover did increase in the post-D (1994 to 2007) period by approximately 25\% and Zc increased to 3.7 and 6.5 m, but the narrow fringing strip of shallower water along the shore in these two deeper bays limited substantial increases in bed extent. Both water clarity and basin morphometry strongly influenced SAV distribution and abundance within the Bay of Quinte.},

title={Inorganic elemental concentrations in water samples from Kentucky Lake, Clarks River and Ohio River: Possible effects on establishment of Zebra Mussel population},
abstract={Every plant and animal species require optimum environmental conditions (Physico-chemical characteristics) to survive, reproduce and establish their population. Zebra Mussel (Dreissena polumorpha; Bivalvia, Dreissenidae) is an exotic and invasive mollusk that spread extensively over various rivers and lakes in the United States. However, these mussels did not reproduce and establish a population in the Kentucky Lake. The objective of this study was to explore various physical and chemical parameters including concentrations of dissolved Ca, Cu, Na, Mg, K, Mn and Zn in river waters that may be crucial for the reproduction and development of zebra mussels. Water samples were collected from selected locations in Kentucky Lake, Ohio River, Clarks River, Bee Creek and Hudson River, NY to delineate differences in physical and chemical parameters that support Zebra Mussels to reproduce and develop in the waters. Standard analytical procedures were followed including field sampling, sample preparation and analysis. Conventional parameters such as temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, conductivity, turbidity were measured using HYDRO Lab equipment. Dissolved inorganic trace elements were analyzed using Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometery. The temperatures in the Kentucky Lake waters ranged from 35 degree F to 95 degree F. DO (mg/L) in Kentucky Lake waters ranged from 0 to 17mg/L. The pH and conductivity in the Kentucky Lake waters ranged from 6.5 to 9.5 and 100 to 250 mu s/cm respectively. Turbidity in the Kentucky Lake waters ranged from 0 to 1400 NTU. In general, detectable concentrations of various inorganic elements were found in almost all samples analyzed. Elemental concentrations ranged from mu g L super( -1) to mg L super(-1) in depending on analyte type and sampling locations. Among the various elements analyzed calcium contained highest concentrations (Range: 7-20 mg/L) in almost all samples from the Kentucky Lake waters, where as Ohio River water samples contained Ca concentration ranging from 21-39 mg/L. The concentration of the inorganic elements in Clarks River and Bee Creek were in the similar range to that of the Kentucky Lake water samples. Copper was barely detected/below the detection limit ( Mg > Na > K > Mn > Zn > Cu. Considering the inorganic elemental concentrations in other rivers and natural lakes, the calcium levels in Kentucky Lake waters were relatively low. Based on calcium-based invasion risk assessment report, calcium level is considered low range to enable zebra mussels to establish population in the Kentucky Lake waters.},

title={Impacts of non-native species in a shallow lake: A simulation modeling approach for restoration and management},
abstract={There is a long use of models in fisheries and ecology. These models have varying assumptions of how underlying processes occur. Chapter 2 found that violating the assumption of continuous fishing could have consequences for managing harvest of fish populations. In particular, as more fish are harvested in a discrete rather than continuous fashion, parameter estimates of biomass dynamics models assuming continuous harvest can be biased. Accounting for discrete harvest using a semi-discrete biomass dynamics model reduced parameter bias and should be used when discrete harvest is occurring. Extending the exponential semi-discrete biomass dynamics model to an actual population of common carp revealed that the population was increasing. Current levels of commercial harvest were insufficient to suppress biomass. Additionally, the rate of biomass increase was rapid, doubling in approximately three years in the absences of harvest. The effect of rapid biomass increase was further demonstrated by a sensitivity analysis of the model to unintentional underharvest. Sensitivity analyses results suggest the potential for a strong fisherman effect on common carp populations. A framework to assess the minimum amount of harvest needed to maintain common carp biomass was presented. The effects of common carp and zebra mussels in aquatic food webs investigated in Chapter 4 revealed a potential impediment to lake restoration. In particular, zooplankton predation by age 0 yellow bass may limit top down regulation of phytoplankton biomass. Based on mass-balance estimates, age 0 yellow bass were estimated to consumer up to 50% of zooplankton production. The recent invasion of zebra mussel was shown to have an effect on phytoplankton populations, likely compensating for reduced zooplankton abundance. Common carp food web impacts were lower than expected, due to abundant benthic food resources. The potential common carp and zebra mussel ecosystem impacts in the context of ongoing restoration were evaluated in Chapter 5. Simulated changes in common carp biomass had dramatic effects on water quality and recreational fishery yield. This effect was due to increased suspended sediment reducing water transparency, which in turn limited phytoplankton production. This also limited any effect of zebra mussels on water quality by limiting food resources (i.e., edible phytoplankton). In scenarios simulating baseline common carp biomass, increasing or decreasing zebra mussel biomass had positive and negative effects on water transparency respectively. Overall, zebra mussel impacts, positive or negative were limited to baseline common carp biomass scenario classes. Additionally, macrophytes biomass showed a dramatic increase when commercial fishing increased in scenarios of baseline common carp biomass, however this may lead to nuisance levels. Unexpectedly, macrophyte increases in response to increased commercial fishing mortality also stimulated common carp increases as an increased food resource. This in turn reduced simulated water clarity and macrophyte biomass. Results of this study suggest that in-lake processes are a significant component to water quality and recreational fishery yield. Controlling common carp biomass will critical to achieve water quality goals and minimize adverse effects on recreational fishery yield. The recent invasion of zebra mussels to the system will likely positively affect water clarity; however this will be limited by common carp. With common carp biomass controlled, zebra mussels can be expected to clear the water column; however this will reduce pelagic primary production, and require consumers to shift to feeding within benthic food web portions.},

abstract={To address the question whether the abundance of an invasive species can be explained by physical and chemical properties of the invaded ecosystems, we gathered density data of invasive zebra mussels and the physical and chemical data of ecosystems they invaded. We assembled published data from 55 European and 13 North American lakes and developed a model for zebra mussel density using a generalized additive model (GAM) approach. Our model revealed that the joint effect of surface area, total phosphorus and calcium concentrations explained 62% of the variation in Dreissena density. Our study indicates that large and less productive North American lakes can support larger local populations of zebra mussels. Our results suggest that the proliferation of an exotic species in an area can partially be explained by physical and chemical properties of the recipient environment.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={The discovery of quagga mussels (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) in Lake Mead, Nevada-Arizona, on January 6, 2007 is the first known occurrence of dreissenid species in the western United States. This study developed elements of a cost-effective and standardized quagga mussel-monitoring program for Lake Mead using preliminary data to arrive at statistically based numbers of sampling sites. To represent the abundance of adult/juvenile quagga mussels in Lake Mead's heterogeneous floor with 95% confidence, a stratified simple random sampling design revealed a requirement of 41 samples from hard substrates (i.e., rocky areas) and 97 samples from soft substrates (i.e., sandy and muddy areas). A simple random sampling design demonstrated that 42 samples from the lake's water column are necessary to represent veliger abundance with 95% confidence. Other important elements of the sampling program, such as standardization of protocols and processes and suggested data analyses, are discussed. The monitoring program, which is based on reconnaissance data, is intended to be optimized with data from its first year's samples. The sample number-selection approach and the other elements of this plan can be easily implemented by lake managers and can also be adapted to other locations where dreissenid mussel monitoring is needed.},

title={Habitat suitability of patch types: A case study of the Yosemite toad},
abstract={Understanding patch variability is crucial in understanding the spatial population structure of wildlife species, especially for rare or threatened species. We used a well-tested maximum entropy species distribution model (Maxent) to map the Yosemite toad (Anaxyrus (= Bufo) canorus) in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California. Twenty-six environmental variables were included in the model representing climate, topography, land cover type, and disturbance factors (e.g., distances to agricultural lands, fire perimeters, and timber harvest areas) throughout the historic range of the toad. We then took a novel approach to the study of spatially structured populations by applying the species-environmental matching model separately for 49 consistently occupied sites of the Yosemite toad compared to 27 intermittently occupied sites. We found that the distribution of the entire population was highly predictable (AUC = 0.95<c2><b1>0.03 SD), and associated with low slopes, specific vegetation types (wet meadow, alpine-dwarf shrub, montane chaparral, red fir, and subalpine conifer), and warm temperatures. The consistently occupied sites were also associated with these same factors, and they were also highly predictable (AUC = 0.95<c2><b1>0.05 SD). However, the intermittently occupied sites were associated with distance to fire perimeter, a slightly different response to vegetation types, distance to timber harvests, and a much broader set of aspect classes (AUC = 0.90<c2><b1>0.11 SD). We conclude that many studies of species distributions may benefit by modeling spatially structured populations separately. Modeling and monitoring consistently-occupied sites may provide a realistic snapshot of current species-environment relationships, important climatic and topographic patterns associated with species persistence patterns, and an understanding of the plasticity of the species to respond to varying climate regimes across its range. Meanwhile, modeling and monitoring of widely dispersing individuals and intermittently occupied sites may uncover environmental thresholds and human-related threats to population persistence.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Issue Title: A Passion for Plankton: a tribute to the life of Stanley Dodson / Guest Editors: H.J. Dumont, J.E. Havel, R. Gulati & P. Spaak The zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) and its congener the quagga mussel (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) are both invaders in freshwater, but have very different invasion histories, with zebra mussels attaining substantially faster rates of spread at virtually all spatial scales. However, in waterbodies where they co-occur, D. r. bugensis can displace D. polymorpha. To determine if the mechanisms for this displacement are associated with different survival and growth, we kept mussels in flow-through tanks for 289<c2><a0>days with two temperature regimes that mimicked the natural surface water (littoral zone) and hypolimnion conditions of Lake Erie. For the littoral zone regime, we used water directly from the surface of Lake Erie (range 4-25<c2><b0>C, average 11.9<c2><a0><c2><b1><c2><a0>0.6<c2><b0>C). For the profundal zone treatment, Lake Erie surface water was chilled to about 6<c2><b0>C (range 5-8<c2><b0>C, average 6.2<c2><a0><c2><b1><c2><a0>0.6<c2><b0>C) for the full duration of the experiment. For each of these temperature regimes, we used three replicate tanks with only zebra mussels present and three replicate tanks with only quagga mussels (150<c2><a0>ind./tank each), and three replicate tanks with both species (75<c2><a0>ind./tank of each species). Quagga mussels had higher survivorship and grew more than zebra mussels in all treatments. For both species, the size of the mussel entering the winter was critical for survivorship. Larger mussels had a higher survival over the winter in all treatments. For both species, there was a survivorship and growth tradeoff. In the warmer littoral zone treatment both species had higher growth, but lower survival than in the colder profundal zone treatment. Surprisingly, although quagga mussels outperformed zebra mussels, zebra mussel survivorship was better when they were faced with competition by quagga mussels than with just intraspecific competition. In addition, quagga mussels suffered size-specific mortality during the growing season only when facing interspecific competition with zebra mussels. Further experiments are needed to determine the possible mechanisms for these interspecific effects.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={The invasive dark falsemussel Mytilopsis leucophaeata (Bivalvia: Dreissenidae): a literature review},
abstract={This paper reviews literature from the Americas and Europe on the dark falsemussel Mytilopsis leucophaeata (Conrad in J Acad Nat Sci Phila 6(2):256-268, 1831), including data collected in its native habitat in the Americas that appear as incidental information in published reports. Mytilopsis leucophaeata is a poorly studied dreissenid bivalve that is native to mainly oligohaline-mesohaline regions of estuaries in North America. In its native habitat, it usually occurs in very low numbers and has rarely been mentioned in field survey reports. However, occasionally in its native habitat and often in habitats where it has been introduced (as in Europe and Brazil), it may undergo population irruptions for no clear reason. This review describes habitat characteristics, environmental tolerances, and biological and ecological attributes of the species. The assembled information reveals the species to be euryhaline and eurythermal, with an unexplained ability to persist in its native estuaries even though it is relatively short-lived and usually uncommon.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Long-term changes in a population of an invasive bivalve and its effects},
abstract={Although the ecological and economic effects of non-native species probably often change through time, few studies have documented such effects. The zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) is an important invader that has had large ecological and economic effects on the ecosystems it has invaded in North America and western Europe. Our 20-year study of the Hudson River, New York, showed that the characteristics of a zebra mussel population and its effects on other benthic animals both changed substantially through time. Over the period of study, annual survivorship of adult zebra mussels fell >100-fold, which caused the aggregate filtration rate of the population to fall by 82%. Population size and body size of zebra mussels may also have fallen. In the early years of the invasion, densities of nearly all benthic animals in deepwater sites fell steeply (by 80-99%). After about 8<c2><a0>years of decline, these populations began to recover, and are approaching pre-invasion densities. The littoral zoobenthos showed neither the initial decline nor the subsequent recovery. Although the mechanisms behind these changes are not fully clear, our study shows that the effects of an invader may change considerably over time.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Hydrologic controls and anthropogenic drivers of the zebra mussel invasion of the Mississippi-Missouri river system},
abstract={We propose a novel ecohydrological model for the invasion of inland waters by the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha and test it against field data gathered within the Mississippi-Missouri river system in North America. This biological invasion poses major ecological and economic threats, especially due to the huge population densities reached by local zebra mussel colonies and the species' unparalleled dispersal abilities within fluvial systems. We focus on a quantitative evaluation, attempted here for the first time, of the individual roles and the mutual interactions of drivers and controls of the Mississippi-Missouri invasion. To this end, we use a multilayer network model accounting explicitly for zebra mussel demographic dynamics, hydrologic transport, and dispersal due to anthropic activities. By testing our results against observations, we show that hydrologic transport alone is not sufficient to explain the spread of the species at the basin scale. We also quantify the role played by commercial navigation in promoting the initial, selective colonization of the river system, and show how recreational boating may have determined the capillary penetration of the species into the water system. The role of post-establishment dispersal mechanisms and the effectiveness of possible prevention measures are also discussed in the context of model sensitivity and robustness to reparametrization.},

title={Resistance of the invasive pest mussel Limnoperna fortunei to anoxia: Implications for biofouling control},
abstract={Invasive mussels cause significant problems in water bodies-and for water utilities. The golden mussel Limnoperna fortunei-like its zebra and quagga mussel cousins-has serious environmental and ecologic effects on the habitats it invades. Native to Asia, the bivalve was likely introduced in South America by transocean ships in the early 1990s. First detected in Argentina along the coasts of the Rio de la Plata Estuary, L. fortunei spread westward and northward and has reached as far north as Brazil into the Pantanal, the world's largest wetland. In this study, small (7-mm) and large (20-mm) mussels were exposed to anoxic conditions under two temperatures (20 and 27 degrees C). The authors found that in industrial installations, regardless of its physiologic effect (which was not studied), anoxia is an economic, effective, and environmentally innocuous alternative for the control of L. fortunei. Although this mussel is more resistant than Dreissena polymorpha at higher temperatures, this study did show that 100\% mortalities can be achieved in slightly more than a week. Other researchers have predicted that L. fortunei's ability to tolerate conditions that limit other mussels could help promote its spread into the drainage systems of three rivers in North America: the Rio Grande, the Colorado, and the Mississippi.},

title={Acute Upper Thermal Limits of Three Aquatic Invasive Invertebrates: Hot Water Treatment to Prevent Upstream Transport of Invasive Species},
abstract={Transport of aquatic invasive species (AIS) by boats traveling up rivers and streams is an important mechanism of secondary spread of AIS into watersheds. Because physical barriers to AIS movement also prevent navigation, alternate methods for preventing spread are necessary while allowing upstream navigation. One promising approach is to lift boats over physical barriers and then use hot water immersion to kill AIS attached to the hull, motor, or fishing gear. However, few data have been published on the acute upper thermal tolerance limits of potential invaders treated in this manner. To test the potential effectiveness of this approach for a planned boat lift on the Fox River of northeastern WI, USA, acute upper thermal limits were determined for three AIS, adult zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha), quagga mussels (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis), and spiny water fleas (Bythotrephes longimanus) from the local area employing temperatures from 32 to 54 degrees C and immersion times from 1 to 20 min. Mortality was determined after immersion followed by a 20-min recovery period. Immersion at 43 degrees C for at least 5 min was required to ensure 100\% mortality for all three species, but due to variability in the response by Bythotrephes a 10 min immersion would be more reliable. Overall there were no significant differences between the three species in acute upper thermal limits. Heated water can be an efficient, environmentally sound, and cost effective method of controlling AIS potentially transferred by boats, and our results should have both specific and wide-ranging applications in the prevention of the spread of aquatic invasive species.},

title={Predation by the invasive American signal crayfish, Pacifastacus leniusculus Dana, on the invasive zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha Pallas: the potential for control and facilitation},
abstract={Non-indigenous crayfish often have major ecological impacts on invaded water bodies, and have contributed to the decline of native crayfish species throughout Europe. The American signal crayfish, Pacifastacus leniusculus, is the most widespread invasive crayfish in Great Britain, where the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, is similarly an invasive pest species. The potential for the American signal crayfish to regulate zebra mussel populations was investigated through a series of laboratory experiments. Crayfish were found to be highly size selective, consuming significantly more of the smallest size class of zebra mussels offered (7-12<c2><a0>mm), over medium (16-21<c2><a0>mm) and large (25-30<c2><a0>mm). Crayfish feeding rate on zebra mussels was not altered when mussels were presented clumped together in natural druses compared with mussels in a disassembled druse. Crayfish spent significantly more time foraging when mussels were unattached, and a greater proportion of attacks were on medium and large than on small mussels (83% of attacks were on medium and large mussels when unattached as opposed to 47% when on druses). Individual crayfish feeding rate decreased significantly at densities of ><c2><a0>~5 crayfish<c2><a0>m^sup -2^. Signal crayfish are, therefore, unlikely to be able to significantly impact established populations of zebra mussels in the wild, although zebra mussels have the potential to provide crayfish with a substantial food source.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Characterizing zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) condition, populations, and community effects in Oklahoma habitats},
abstract={Scope and Method of Study: Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha ) are one of the most widely recognized aquatic invasive species in North America. Their negative effects on native species, ecosystems, and industry have been widely documented within the scientific literature, yet their ultimate distribution is still widely debated. As Oklahoma was initially considered their southern distributional limits due to warm summer water temperatures, an evaluation of their population characteristics, growth and physiological condition within Oklahoma's reservoirs may provide insight into the potential for infestations further south. This study sought to characterize D. polymorpha density and reproduction in several Oklahoma reservoirs, assess their physiological condition on a seasonal scale, and determine if they have had a negative effect on native mussel communities in the Verdigris River. Findings and Conclusions: An 8-year study at Oologah Lake, OK revealed peak zebra mussel densities near 150,000/m super(2) within 2 years of discovery, however during 2006 a dieoff associated with 30 degree C water temperatures and flooding events in subsequent years reduced these densities significantly. Native mussel surveys within the Verdigris River suggested there had been no significant decline in richness or abundance of native species since introduction of the zebra mussel, however reductions may still occur in the future particularly if zebra mussel densities remain high for several consecutive years. Similar zebra mussel densities were observed in Sooner Lake, OK, during a 4-year study despite an altered thermal regime in that system. Summer dieoffs of reproductively mature zebra mussels were recorded, however the population was able to recover in each subsequent year driven by young of the year mussels, perhaps better able to tolerate warm summer water temperatures. Multiple condition indices revealed D. polymorpha are in poorest physiological condition during July and August and are in best condition in May and June. Thermal tolerance bioassays indicated zebra mussels in Oklahoma have not developed any enhanced upper thermal tolerance and exhibit similar oxygen consumption and ammonia excretion ratios as compared with mussels from more northern populations.},

title={Evaluating the role of exotic dreissenid mussels in the disappearance of the benthic amphipod Diporeia spp. In the Laurentian Great Lakes},
abstract={The burrowing amphipod Diporeia spp. has historically been the dominant macroinvertebrate and a high quality prey item for fish in benthic habitats of deep freshwater lakes of North America. In the mid-1990s, Diporeia populations began to decline in many of the Laurentian Great Lakes as exotic zebra and quagga mussels (Dreissena spp.) expanded after introduction from eastern Europe via transoceanic shipping. By 2010, this Great Lakes ecosystem health indicator had disappeared from vast areas of benthic habitat 30 m, suggesting that remote ecosystem disruption by shallow mussels played a role. Diporeia populations in the Finger Lakes coexist with dreissenid mussels and represent a key anomaly to the pattern of decline seen in the Great Lakes. The experimental component of this study evaluated the pathogen and food limitation hypotheses by exposing Diporeia to dreissenids in controlled laboratory conditions. Short-term (28-day) exposures using different combinations of Diporeia and quagga mussel populations did not indicate that quagga mussel populations from Great Lakes or Finger Lakes carry pathogens or toxins harmful to Diporeia. Longer-term (90-day) exposures suggest that the direct presence of dreissenids can actually benefit Diporeia leading to weight gain and higher fecundity relative to no-mussel controls. Diporeia may utilize biodeposits or periphyton associated with quagga mussels. A feeding trial with terrestrial organic matter (partially decomposed leaf litter), an alternative food source available in Cayuga Lake, also led to weight gain for Diporeia although survival was low. Fatty acid tracers, particularly the monounsaturate palmitoleic acid (16:1w7), were useful for assessing the dietary role of diatoms for Diporeia. The findings of my dissertation suggest that dreissenids may not have initiated the Diporeia decline. However, the continued expansion of dreissenid mussels in lakes Michigan, Huron, and Ontario is driving ecosystem disruptions including the disappearance of the spring diatom bloom that have major ramifications for the survival of remnant profundal populations of Diporeia.},

title={The biological pathway and effect of PCBs on common terns in Lake Michigan},
abstract={Poly-chlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have been recognized as a significant contaminant in the Great Lakes ecosystem. Although PCBs are implicated in the reduced survival and reproductive success of several piscivorous bird species, the biological pathway in which PCBs bioaccumulate remains largely unknown. This study investigates the two most likely biological pathways, suggested via research on Great Lakes sport fish, by which PCBs would be acquired by common terns (Sterna hirundo), a piscivorous species of conservation concern. The first proposed pathway is through atmospheric deposition of PCBs which are subsequently acquired by filter-feeding fish (e.g., alewives, Alosa pseudoharengus). An alternative pathway is via the biodeposits of zebra mussels which are consumed by shallow water fish (e.g., round gobies, Neogobius melanostromus). Because common terns breed in near-shore sites where concentrations of zebra mussels are found, as well as forage in more pelagic environments it is possible that either or both pathways may be contributing to their PCB exposure. Field experiments and stable isotope analyses suggest the most likely pathway by which terns are exposed to PCBs is via alewives, similar to how apex predators such as lake trout acquire PCBs. Biodeposits from zebra mussels do not appear to be a significant factor in PCB accumulation in terns. We quantified extremely poor parental attentiveness during incubation. Although we cannot determine whether poor parental attentiveness alone or in combination with PCB contamination led to low hatching success, accumulation of PCBs appears to have significant impacts on the overall reproductive success of common terns.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Long-Term and Recent Changes in Southern Lake Michigan Water Quality with Implications for Present Trophic Status},
abstract={Southern Lake Michigan has changed in response to alterations in nutrients and invasive species. NOAA and EPA monitoring results are used to examine those changes. NOAA provides detailed seasonal resolution, but limited spatial coverage, whereas the EPA provides more spatial coverage, but limited seasonal resolution. We compare changes in total phosphorus (TP), silica, nitrate plus nitrite, and chlorophyll concentrations from before and after the invasion by the quagga mussel (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis). Although TP at NOAA stations was consistently higher than at EPA stations, both confirm declines in spring and summer surface mixed layer (SML) conditions. Chlorophyll differed at EPA and NOAA stations before quagga mussel invasion, but not after the invasion. Spring chlorophyll decreased at NOAA stations after the invasion, but summer conditions did not change at either set of stations. Pre-invasion silica at NOAA stations was slightly higher than at EPA stations, and the lake's Si reservoir increased over the study period. Basin-scale spring Si increased gradually, whereas summer SML Si increased dramatically after 2003, likely reflecting reduced diatom production. Basin-scale nitrate increased significantly from pre- to post-invasion in both spring and summer. Summer nitrate utilization declined drastically in recent years, likely reflecting reduced phytoplankton production. TP loads decreased; however, the timing of changes in chlorophyll and Si and nitrate utilization suggest the recent increase in dreissenid filtering dramatically reduced spring phytoplankton abundance and production across the entire southern basin. The offshore pelagic zone of the historically mesotrophic southern Lake Michigan is now similar to oligotrophic Lake Superior.},

title={Is Gammarus tigrinus (Crustacea, Amphipoda) becoming cosmopolitan through shipping? Predicting its potential invasive range using ecological niche modeling},
abstract={While the intensity of global shipping has increased dramatically over the last decades, species exchange between continents has likewise intensified. Ballast water of ships is recognized playing a major role in this process. Many of the larger sea ports have become bridgeheads for invasions. Ecological niche modeling is used to investigate the potential invasive range and high invasive risk ports of the North American amphipod Gammarus tigrinus. Sixty-two occurrences of G. tigrinus in its native range (North America) and 34 environmental data sets were compiled. Data on dispersal distances were used via ecological niche modeling to analyze the invasive potential of G. tigrinus. The invasive risk of large ports was analyzed according to modeling result, as well as their salinity in the main oceanic routes of the world. G. tigrinus had a rapid range extension on the British Isles and in the rest of Western Europe. Now it is invading the countries surrounding the Baltic Sea. Worldwide it has a vast potential invasive range. It has a high invasive risk for many large ports along the main oceanic routes, among which the ports of Shanghai, Buenos Aires and Montevideo have the highest invasive risk. G. tigrinus may become cosmopolitan through shipping, and this possibility is increasing. Particular emphasis should be placed on preventing human-mediated dispersal. Ports may be the first places G. tigrinus invades. This study can identify high invasive risk ports, especially those at risk of introduced North America species. More importantly, the water of large ports should be monitored regularly for exotic aquatic organisms that may survive temporarily or permanently.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={A risk-based decision model and risk assessment of invasive mussels},
abstract={Ecological risks and economical impacts of zebra mussels (Dreissena polyrnorpha) include alterations in the transfer of energy and cycling of materials in aquatic systems, increased accumulation of contaminants in aquatic food chains, clogging of water intakes, and damage to related infrastructure. A risk-based decision model was developed to assess the likelihood of zebra mussel invasion and establishment throughout the St. Croix Basin. The risk-based decision model CASM(ZM) is a version of the comprehensive aquatic systems model (CASM) and that was modified to simulate the growth, reproduction, and spatial distribution of zebra mussels. As a risk management tool, the model simulates the population dynamical complexity of zebra mussel populations, as well as their impacts on phytoplankton, zooplankton, benthic invertebrates, fish and natural mussel populations. The CASM(ZM) is based in part on a set of zebra mussel's physical-chemical habitat requirements such as calcium concentration (17 mg/L), total hardness (57.5 mg/L), conductivity (62 mu S/cm), dissolved oxygen concentration (6 mg/L), salinity (7 PSU), pH (6.8 and 9.4), Secchi disk depths (75 and 205 cm), and water temperatures for growth (14 degrees C) and reproduction (30 degrees C). The CASM(ZM) also includes a bioenergetics framework that describes the growth of zebra mussels and their trophic impacts on aquatic food webs. The CASM(ZM) can be used to forecast the risk of successful dreissenid invasions and assess the associated impacts of invasive mussels on food web dynamics of previously uninfested aquatic systems throughout the St. Croix Basin.

title={Forecasting the expansion of the invasive golden mussel Limnopernafortunei in Brazilian and North American rivers based on its occurrence in the Paraguay River and Pantanal wetland of Brazil},
abstract={The bivalve Limnopernafortunei (Dunker, 1857), also called golden mussel, is native to Asia but becoming dispersed around the world. The golden mussel resembles the invasive dreissenid bivalves in many respects, and although much less studied it evidently has broader environmental tolerances. The golden mussel was introduced into the La Plata River estuary (South America) and quickly expanded upstream to the north, into the tropical Paraguay River reaching a large floodplain area in Brazil known as the Pantanal wetland. The golden mussel tolerates environmental conditions in the Pantanal that would be inhospitable for most bivalves, but mussel mortality has been observed during the most extreme oxygen depletion events. Based on knowledge about the limiting factors for the golden mussel in the Pantanal wetland, its potential distribution was predicted for the remainder of the Paraguay River basin where the species is not present, as well as in other river systems throughout Brazil. Forecasts of potential distribution in Brazilian river systems were based on physicochemical limitations for shell calcification, and specifically on lower thresholds of dissolved calcium concentrations and the calcium carbonate (calcite) index of saturation, which may be a better indicator of calcification potential in low-calcium waters than calcium concentration alone. In addition to examining spatial patterns in calcium and calcification potential, these and other limnological and climate variables were used in ecological niche modeling using GARP and Maxent algorithms. Forecasts of potential distributions in three major North American river systems (Mississippi, Colorado, and Rio Grande) were based mainly on water temperature because calcium availability and calcification evidently would not be limiting to golden mussel establishment in those waters. Due to the greater tolerance of the golden mussel to conditions known to limit other bivalves, as well as its greater ability for shell calcification in low-calcium water, the golden mussel could potentially become broadly distributed throughout Brazil. According to its thermal tolerance L. fortunei could become established in the Mississippi, Colorado and Rio Grande drainage systems, although the northern Mississippi River system including the Missouri River may be too cool in the winter to support the golden mussel.},

title={Stoichiometry in a benthic invasive: Exploring how stoichiometric imbalances with algal resources affect zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) growth and condition},
abstract={Scope and Method of Study. Ecological Stoichiometry has become a new framework to describe interactions in many different habitats. In this research, I used stoichiometry to examine the effects of food quality and quantity on zebra mussel growth and condition. This study took place in 60, 1L microcosms under controlled laboratory conditions. Zebra mussels were fed Scenedesmus sp. at two food quantities (1mg C L super( -1) and 4mg C L super(-1)) and two food qualities (C:P ratios 20 and 45). These food quality treatments were selected to represent very low C:P ratios to represent C:P ratios that are found in eutrophic systems across North America. Treatments were crossed to make 4 total treatments; 20-1, 20-4, 45-1, and 45-4. Findings and Conclusions. Zebra mussel shell growth was not affected by algal quality or quantity. However, dry tissue mass and Tissue Condition Index (TCI) were significantly lower in the lower C:P ratio treatments (20-1, 20-4) when compared to the higher C:P ratio treatments (45-1, 45-4). Significantly more ammonia and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) were also excreted in the lower C:P ratio treatments than in the higher C:P ratio treatments. There were no food quantity effects on growth, TCI, or excretion, but there was a significant interaction between food quality and food quantity for TCI and excretion in the 45-4 treatment, with TCI being the greatest and excretion being the lowest between all treatments. Combined, these results show that despite enhanced excretion of excessive nutrients, there were significant growth and condition penalties at the lower C:P treatments, clearly indicating toxic effects of excess dietary P. Zebra mussels were also able to adjust their tissue stoichiometry based on food quality to a certain point, but were not able to benefit from the excess P in the food resources. Therefore, the response of consumers to stoichiometric imbalances is driven by not only when nutrients are limiting but also when nutrients are in excess, and should be considered especially under rapid cultural eutrophication. With respect to zebra mussel invasions, there may be stoichiometric limitations in eutrophic and hyper-eutrophic systems that do not allow zebra mussels to have the same effect as seen in other systems.},

abstract={Decades since the initial establishment of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) in North America, understanding and controlling the invasion of aquatic ecosystems continues to be a problem in continent-wide conservation and landscape management. While the high economic and conservation burden of this species makes accurate predictions of future invasions a research priority, forecasting is confounded by limited data, tenuous model assumptions, and the stochasticity of the invasion process. Using a new method for niche identification, we profiled invasion vulnerability for 1,017 lakes in the Great Lakes region of the Unites States. We used a nonparametric geoadditive regression model to test for effects of two water quality variables on the present distribution of zebra mussels. We then used the support vector data description (SVDD), a support vector machine for one-class classification, to estimate the boundary of the ecological niche. By disentangling niche estimation from distributional assumptions, computational niche models could be used to test an array of fundamental concepts in ecology and evolution, while species invasions forecasting is representative of the wide range of potential applications for niche identification in conservation and management.},

title={Colonisation by Dreissena of Great Lakes coastal ecosystems: how suitable are wetlands?},
abstract={Summary1. Invasive zebra (Dreissena polymorpha) and quagga mussels (Dreissena bugensis) have become widespread throughout the Great Lakes basin. However, some types of Great Lakes coastal wetlands may be unsuitable for Dreissena invasion.2. To test this observation, artificial substrata were placed in wetlands (with emergent vegetation) and in adjacent open water (without emergent vegetation) habitats in two types of Great Lakes coastal ecosystems: drowned river mouth (DRM) and coastal fringing systems. Wetlands in DRM systems generally have deep organic sediment and limited water movement, whereas coastal fringing wetlands generally have low to moderate amounts of organic sediment and intense wind and wave action.3. We did not find a significant difference in Dreissena colonisation between wetlands and adjacent open water habitat in fringing systems. However, Dreissena colonisation was significantly lower in DRM wetlands than in the adjacent open water. We also found significantly lower survival in DRM wetlands than adjacent open water habitats, whereas survival did not differ significantly in coastal fringing wetlands and the adjacent open water.4. Our results suggest that vulnerability to Dreissena invasion varied among wetland types with DRM wetlands being less suitable than fringing wetlands. We suggest that colonisation and survival of Dreissena is lower in wetlands with deep organic sediment and less turbulent water.},

title={Eradication of colonizing populations of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) by early detection and SCUBA removal: Lake George, NY},
abstract={1. Since their introduction to North America, zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) and quagga mussels (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) have rapidly colonized North American fresh waters. Strategies for limiting the economic and ecological impacts of zebra mussels exist, but there are few examples where once zebra mussels have invaded a natural body of water they have been removed or managed without the use of ecologically destructive methods. The first successful attempt to eradicate a colonizing population of zebra mussels using SCUBA is reported here. Studies were conducted in Lake George, NY. 2. Since zebra mussel larvae had been detected prior to the discovery of adults in Lake George, a comprehensive management programme for zebra mussels was in place when mussels were found in 1999, at a single location in the southern part of the Lake (Lake George Village site). Efforts were quickly launched to remove as many mussels as possible by SCUBA with the intent of minimizing the risk of the population reproducing and establishing a permanent presence in the Lake. 3. Population size at the discovery site was initially estimated at fewer than 30 000 animals. Between 1999 and 2007 more than 21 000 animals were removed from the site, over 90\% of them shortly after the colony was discovered. Continued monitoring of the site for larvae, recruitment, and growth suggests that the animals have not successfully reproduced since the project began. Since detection at the Lake George Village site, six separate colonizing populations at other locations in the lake were found and similar removal efforts appear to be having comparable success. 4. This study demonstrates that the combination of early detection, suboptimal habitat, proactive establishment of a rapid response and management plan, and cooperation of a comprehensive network of stakeholders can prevent a successful zebra mussel invasion.

title={Characteristics of a refuge for native freshwater mussels (Bivalvia: Unionidae) in Lake St. Clair},
abstract={The Lake St. Clair delta (6 100 km super(2)) provides an important refuge for native freshwater mussels (Unionidae) wherein 22 of the 6 35 historical species co-occur with invasive dreissenids. A total of 1875 live unionids representing 22 species were found during snorkeling surveys of 32 shallow (6 1 m) sites throughout the delta. Richness and density of unionids and zebra mussel infestation rates varied among sites from 3 to 13 unionid species, 0.02 to 0.12 unionids/m super(2), and < 1 to 35 zebra mussels/unionid, respectively. Zebra mussel infestation of unionids in the delta appears to be mitigated by dominant offshore currents, which limit densities of zebra mussel veligers in nearshore compared to offshore waters (13,600 vs. 28,000/m super(3), respectively). Glycogen concentrations in the tissues of a common and widespread species in the delta (Lampsilis siliquoidea) suggest that zebra mussels may be adversely affecting physiological condition of unionids in a portion of the Lake St. Clair delta. Physiological condition and community structure of unionids within the delta may also be influenced by differences in food quantity and quality resulting from the uneven distribution of water flowing from the St. Clair River. The delta likely supports the largest living unionid community in the lower Great Lakes and includes several species that have been listed as Endangered or Threatened in Canada and/or the state of Michigan, making it an important refuge for the conservation of native unionids.},

title={Patterns of biodiversity and co-occurrence of native and nonindigenous species at Great Lakes coastal margins},
abstract={Studies that assess the ecological processes that allow establishment by a nonindigenous species in the Laurentian Great Lakes can help elucidate general ecological processes. The Great Lakes has such varied habitats that observations of any general patterns in ecological processes, involving both native species and nonindigenous species, likely pertain elsewhere. Studies relating biotic interactions and interaction-neutral processes to invasibility are numerous, but they have been largely inconclusive. This thesis evaluates hypotheses linking biotic interaction (i.e., richness, evenness, and dominance) and neutral-interaction (i.e., dispersal/propagule pressure) processes of several taxonomic groups (birds, diatoms, fishes, macroinvertebrates, and wetland vegetation) to invasibility at various spatial scales and sample sizes. These hypotheses were assessed using synoptic sample collections from various locations throughout the US Laurentian Great Lakes coastal margins influenced by varying types and levels of anthropogenic disturbance. I tested hypotheses relating biotic resistance versus habitat suitability to invasion by a nonindigenous amphipod. Results supported the view that biotic facilitation by dreissenid mussels and distribution of suitable habitats better explain the distribution of the nonindigenous amphipod than anthropogenic disturbance and biotic resistance. I evaluated hypotheses relating richness, evenness, and relative species dominance to invasibility and the occurrence of native and nonindigenous species using data compiled for various taxonomic groups from several hundred locations along the US coastline of the Laurentian Great Lakes. Across taxonomic groups, trends of native and nonindigenous species distributions were inconsistent with regulation by biotic interaction related processes. Regulation by neutral processes, such as propagule pressure or habitat suitability may better explain patterns. Native species distributions were correlated with habitat suitability and habitat hydrogeomorphology, and ranges reflect biogeographic history. The factors that constrain nonindigenous species are arguably a variation of those that constrain native species distributions, thus indicating that similar factors constrain both native and nonindigenous species. The general accuracy of these synoptic findings was assessed by comparing biodiversity estimation performance of data resulting from intensive sampling protocols. A method proposed by Olszewski (2004), which is alternative to rarefaction and statistical estimators for species richness, was also tested. This method uses the evenness component of biodiversity and requires a limited number of samples for estimations. My findings indicated that true biodiversity measures cannot be attained efficiently from surveys. Since such measures are unattainable, interpretation of biodiversity studies would benefit from closer examination of detectable species (i.e., common species) that likely have a stronger impact on community processes, than rare and/or transient species. Nonindigenous species that become widespread and abundant are likely governed by the same factors that regulate common native species. Ecology would benefit from linking studies of the factors that regulate the distribution and abundances of common species, both native and nonindigenous, and the dynamics between biodiversity and ecosystem properties and processes.},

abstract={This second state-of-the-lake report for Lake Michigan identifies progress made during 2000-2004 in meeting the fish-community objectives established for the lake in 1995. An oral public report, providing more-extensive data than given here, was made in 2005. During 2000-2004, a geographical information system for the lake and its basin was expanded considerably and is expected to provide a means for establishing priorities for habitat remediation. This system was used in the development of a report, under review, identifying environmental objectives for the lake. Recently introduced invertebrates, particularly dreissenid mussels (Dreissena spp.), continued to impact the lake's food web. The number of naturally reproduced Chinook salmon smolts increased from about 2.5 million in the years just before 2000 to an average of more than 4.0 million during this reporting period. The yield of Chinook salmon was below the objective of 3.1 million kg during 2001-2003 but rose to 3.9 million kg in 2004. The harvest was not considered sustainable, even though stocking was cut in 1999, because growth, ration, and prey abundance were declining.},

title={THE STATE OF LAKE HURON IN 2004},
abstract={During this five-year reporting period (2000-2004), progress was made in Lake Huron towards achieving the objective of a fish community dominated by top predators, with self-sustaining populations of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) playing a prominent role. Some examples include increased representation of wild-born lake trout in surveys of adult lake trout, capture of wild young-of-the-year lake trout, and very large reductions in the abundance of the exotic alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), a species that likely impedes the rehabilitation of lake trout and other native species. Sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) abundance also decreased, which is a benefit for lake trout rehabilitation and for overall usable fish production. On the other hand, concerns have arisen that overall fishery productivity may have declined since 1999, the end of the previous reporting period. While the objective of a diverse salmon and trout fishery has been partially met, the contribution of the once-dominant Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) has declined dramatically. Overall yield objectives for both salmonid and non-salmonid species appear to be unrealistic. Predators are showing indications of substantial food limitation with overall prey-fish abundance substantially lower in 2004 than in 1999. Substantial uncertainty exists regarding the nature of the productivity changes and the role of dreissenid mussels and other exotic species in these changes. The yield of lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis), the dominant commercial species, declined from 1999 to 2004 to levels just below the yield target in the fish-community objective for all coregonines combined. Given the changes in lower trophic levels and the downward trend in lake whitefish yield, the target for coregonine yield, of which lake whitefish is the major component, is likely unsustainable. Lakewide walleye (Sander vitreus) yield remained near 35% of the yield target within the fish-community objective. Large year-classes of juvenile walleye were produced in Saginaw Bay in 2003 and 2004. How strongly these year-classes will contribute to fishery yield and whether juvenile abundance has surged elsewhere remains to be determined. Yellow perch (Perca flavescens) yield has declined to levels not seen since the 1920s for reasons that are not well understood. However, strong year-classes were observed in 2003 in the main basin. The lake sturgeon remains listed as a Threatened Species in Michigan, and as a Species of Concern in Ontario waters. Although its population increased, much progress is needed before the listings can be removed. Various escocids, centrarchids, and other nearshore species continue to contribute to diverse fishing opportunities. Species diversity remains essentially unchanged since 1999 with the notable reappearance of the shortjaw cisco (C. zenithicus), which was thought to be extirpated at the time of the 1999 report. An increasing number of studies of genetic stock structure have been conducted or are under way, but these projects are not sufficient to fully evaluate progress towards genetic-diversity objectives. In addition to exotic species that may be influencing the food web, invasive plant species are increasingly dominating wetlands and other nearshore areas and are potentially influencing the value of these areas as fish nursery habitat or as areas for recreation. More information is needed to assess progress towards habitat objectives. The foremost recommendation stemming from this report is to reevaluate the use of yield as the major metric for defining fish-community objectives. Increased research is also needed to better understand how lower trophic-level processes impact fish-community structure and production. Other recommendations include maintaining effective sea lamprey control, identifying high-priority habitat in need of protection, and directing more management towards native species restoration.},

title={Spatial-Dynamic Modeling of Algal Biomass in Lake Erie: Relative Impacts of Dreissenid Mussels and Nutrient Loads},
abstract={Over the past several decades, reductions in phytoplankton stocks and increased water clarity in Lake Erie have resulted from phosphorus load abatement and the introduction of zebra (Dreissena polymorpha) and quagga mussels (D. bugensis). The relative impacts of these developments and their implications for lake management have remained difficult to delineate. To address this issue, we numerically model the complex biophysical interactions occurring in Lake Erie using a two-dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model that is extended to include dreissenid mussel and zooplankton algorithms. The model reasonably simulates longitudinal trends in water quality as well as the dynamics of central basin hypoxia. Phosphorus is the limiting nutrient through the euphotic zone and its control decreases the algal growth rate and biomass (655-60%). Filter feeding by dreissenid mussels also decreases algal biomass (625-30%), simultaneously stimulating increased net algae growth through enhanced algal consumption and subsequent phosphorus recycling. Effective recycling implies that algae stocks are ultimately regulated by external phosphorus loads. Returning phosphorus loads to pre-abatement 1960s levels, in the presence of dreissenid mussels, results in a western basin algae concentration of 60.7 mg dry weight L super(-1) with a potential for nuisance algae growth.},

title={Dietary Overlap of Sympatric Diving Ducks During Winter on Northeastern Lake Ontario},
abstract={Food resources available to diving ducks wintering on the Great Lakes have changed dramatically since the introduction of dreissenid mussels (Dreissena bugensis and D. polymorpha ). We investigated the diets of Buffleheads (Bucephala albeola ), Common Goldeneyes (B. clangula ), and Long-tailed Ducks (Clangula hyemalis ) during winter, 2002-2004, on northeastern Lake Ontario and determined the levels of dietary overlap. Dietary niche-breadth values were low, and dietary overlap values (prey size and type) were high for all species. Ducks primarily consumed high-quality, energy-dense prey (Amphipoda, Chironomidae), which were abundant. Our results highlighted three patterns: (1) dreissenid mussels constituted 85% of the macroinvertebrate community in Lake Ontario but were consumed in relatively low amounts during winter, (2) foods of high energy-density such as Amphipoda and Chironomidae were likely abundant enough for ducks to selectively feed on them, and (3) some constraint caused ducks to select energy-dense prey instead of the most available items (dreissenid mussels). Although the abundance of prey may have allowed numbers of diving ducks to increase in the past few decades on the Great Lakes, the long-term implications of high levels of dietary overlap among diving ducks is relatively unknown and warrants continued monitoring.

title={Trends over Time for the Arkansas River Fishery: A Case History},
abstract={We evaluated long-term fisheries data relative to a range of perturbations for the Arkansas River from 1970 to 2006. Rotenone sample sites were located at pool 1,9 (Garrison Creek), Ozark Lake (Lavaca), and Lake Dardanelle (Panther Cove and the Arkansas Nuclear I Effluent Bay). The period of record was 24 years for Garrison Creek and Lavaca, 29 years for Effluent Bay, and so years for Panther Cove. Mean total fish biomass ranged between 466 kg/ha and 1,601 kg/ha among sites, and no temporal trends were detected for total biomass. Invasion of zebra mussels Dreissena polymorpha, discovery of largemouth bass virus, and imposition of a 381 mm total length (TL) minimum length limit for largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides likely contributed to notable changes in these fisheries during the past 30 years. Biomass of redear sunfish Lepomis microlophus, freshwater drum Aplodinotus grunniens, and blue catfish Ictalurus furcatus increased in association with the invasion of the river by normative zebra mussels. Spotted gar Lepisosteus oculatus and paddlefish Polyodon spathula biomass increased, and common carp Cyprinus carpio biomass declined coincident with the zebra Mussel invasion. Large-scale sedimentation of aquatic habitats may have been related to observed declines of backwater-oriented species, especially common carp and spotted gar. The frequency bass between 350 and 4.00 mm TL increased in electrofishing samples after the imposition of a 381-mm-TL minimum length limit, and total catch per hour of largemouth bass greater than 38 1 mm TL increased. Our associations would suggest that the discovery of largemouth bass virus during 2000 contributed to (1) lower electrofishing catch per hour of largemouth bass greater than 533 mm TL, and (2) an average increase of 420 h required for an angler to catch a 2.2-7-kg largemouth bass. We anticipate further changes in the Arkansas River during the next decade from the biological invasions of white perch Morone americana, bighead carp Hypophthalmichthys nobilis, and silver carp H. molitrix; increased establishment of aquatic vegetation; and accelerated loss of aquatic habitats associated with planned federal navigation channel improvements.},

title={A management framework for preventing the secondary spread of aquatic invasive species},
abstract={Biological invasions continue to accelerate, and there is a need for closer integration between invasive species research and on-the-ground management. In many regions, aquatic invasive species have established isolated populations, but have not yet spread to many sites that provide suitable habitat. In the Laurentian Great Lakes region, several Great Lakes invaders such as zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha), rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax), and spiny water flea (Bythotrephes longimanus) are currently undergoing secondary spread to the smaller inland lakes and streams. This paper describes recent advances in forecasting the secondary spread of aquatic invasive species and presents a framework for assessing vulnerability of inland waters based on explicit assessment of three distinct aspects of biological invasions: colonization, site suitability, and adverse impact. In many cases, only a fraction of lakes on the landscape are vulnerable to specific invasive species, highlighting the potential application of this type of research for improving invasive species management. Effective application to on-the-ground resource management will require that research aimed at assessing site vulnerability be translated into management tools.Original Abstract: Les invasions biologiques continuent aaugmenter en nombre, c'est pourquoi il est necessaire de mieux integrer la recherche sur les especes envahissantes et leur gestion sur le terrain.

abstract={We examined the effect of the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, an exotic species, on seston stoichiometry by conducting laboratory experiments in which we varied nutrient composition of seston and mussels over time. Zebra mussels altered the stoichiometry of seston through removal of particulate organic nutrients and changed the stoichiometry of the dissolved nutrient pool through nutrient excretion. Grazers had stronger effects on carbon : phosphorus (C : P) and nitrogen (N) : P ratios than on the C:N ratio of seston. Elemental residence time in tissue and high mass-specific nutrient excretion by small mussels caused small mussels to be more efficient nutrient recyclers than larger mussels. Zebra mussels reduced P availability through enhancing C: P and N: P molar ratios of seston during the period extending from June to August, when P was limited in the lake, and increased the C:N molar ratio of seston in June, when N was at the minimum level in the lake. C: P and N: P molar ratios for zebra mussel tissue were higher in August and somewhat in September than in all other months. N was retained more efficiently than P in Dreissena tissue. Nutrient mass-specific uptake rate was higher than excretion rate by zebra mussels.},

title={Effects of Zebra Mussels (Dreissena Polymorpha) on Mobility of Three Native Mollusk Species},
abstract={As invaders to North America, zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) have contributed to the decline of benthic species, the mechanisms of which are poorly understood. In this study, we examined effects of D. polymorpha biofouling on locomotion of one pleurocerid snail (Elimia livescens) and two unionid bivalves (Ligumia nasuta and Anodonta grandis) using observational studies and removal experiments. In field and laboratory experiments, E. livescens without zebra mussels traveled 1.5-1.6 times farther than snails with zebra mussels. In field experiments, unionids without zebra mussels traveled farther and were more likely to move than unionids colonized by zebra mussels. Decreases in travel distance in the snail, but not unionids, were significantly correlated with zebra mussel loading relative to host animal mass. Limited mobility caused by zebra mussels may have consequences for gastropods and unionids by disrupting reproductive habits, predator evasion and avoidance of unbearable environmental conditions. Localized extinctions may occur due to inability to disperse or energetic costs associated with carrying zebra mussels. Mobility constraints resulting from zebra mussel biofouling may be an important mechanism of population declines in native mollusk species.},

The habitats consisted of the following objects: (1) living zebra mussels; (2) empty mussel shells (clean or coated with nail varnish) with both valves glued together using aquarium silicone sealant to imitate a living mussel; (3) stones (clean or varnished); (4) empty plates. Ten objects of the same type were glued to a plastic plate (10 <c3><97> 10 cm) with methyl acrylic glue. The plates were placed in experimental tanks in various combinations. A single gammarid was put into the tank and its position was determined after 24 h. The studied species responded differently to the presence of zebra mussels. D. haemobaphes preferred living mussels rather than their empty shells and these two habitats over stones and empty plates. It responded positively to shell shape, selecting varnished shells rather than varnished stones, and to shell surface properties, selecting clean shells rather than varnished shells. It did not respond to waterborne mussel exudates. P. robustoides did not exhibit any preferences for the above-mentioned substrata. G. fossarum was attracted by empty mussel shells (but not by living mussels). It responded only to their shape, not to surface properties. The strong affinity for zebra mussels, exhibited by D. haemobaphes, might help it survive and develop stable populations in newly invaded areas.},

title={Predicting habitat use and trophic interactions of Eurasian ruffe, round gobies, and zebra mussels in nearshore areas of the Great Lakes},
abstract={The Laurentian Great Lakes have been subject to numerous introductions of nonindigenous species, including two recent benthic fish invaders, Eurasian ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernuus) and round gobies (Neogobius melanostomus), as well as the benthic bivalve, zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha). These three exotic species, or ``exotic triad,{''} may impact nearshore benthic communities due to their locally high abundances and expanding distributions. Laboratory experiments were conducted to determine (1) whether ruffe and gobies may compete for habitat and invertebrate food in benthic environments, and (2) if zebra mussels can alter those competitive relationships by serving as an alternate food source for gobies. In laboratory mesocosms, both gobies and ruffe preferred cobble and macrophyte areas to open sand either when alone or in sympatry. In a 9-week goby-ruffe competition experiment simulating an invasion scenario with a limited food base, gobies grew faster than did ruffe, suggesting that gobies may be competitively superior at low resource levels. When zebra mussels were added in a short-term experiment, the presence or absence of mussels did not affect goby or ruffe growth, as few zebra mussels were consumed. This finding, along with other laboratory evidence, suggests that gobies may prefer soft-bodied invertebrate prey over zebra mussels. Studies of interactions among the ``exotic triad{''}, combined with continued surveillance, may help Great Lakes fisheries managers to predict future population sizes and distributions of these invasive fish, evaluate their impacts on native food webs, and direct possible control measures to appropriate species.},

Productivity has decreased in recent years due to actions by jurisdictions within the basin to reduce phosphorus loading and to the filter-feeding of expanding populations of dreissenid mussels (zebra and quagga). Dreissenid colonies encrust hard and soft natural habitat perhaps causing the decline in abundance of the amphipod Diporeia spp. Some embayments and coastal wetlands are degraded due to development, water-level control, and pollution by an expanding human population. Contaminant levels have declined in Lake Ontario fishes, but levels of PCBs, mirex, dioxin, and mercury are still high enough to trigger fish-consumption advisories.

Both species are sessile, byssate bivalves with a planktonic larval stage and extremely high reproductive capacity. For both species adults attain much higher biomass in waterbodies they invade than all of the Dative invertebrates combined, and they create substrate complexity otherwise not found in freshwater systems. Both are very active suspension feeders, greatly enhance benthicpelagic coupling, and act as effective ecosystem engineers. Although taxonomically unrelated, their ecosystem impacts are surprisingly similar and follow from the novel ecological niche they share, rather than being species specific. The golden mussel has broader environmental tolerances and therefore may be a much more successful invader than D. polymorpha in regions dominated by acidic, soft and contaminated waters. In the near future L. fortunei may colonize the southern and central parts of North America, much farther north than has been previously predicted. Although to date the zebra mussel is considered the most aggressive freshwater invader, soon many waterbodies may receive another, even more aggressive invader.},

title={Effects of increasing temperatures on population dynamics of the zebra mussel <i>Dreissena polymorpha</i>: implications from an individual-based model},
abstract={Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha, Pallas, 1771) have had unprecedented success in colonizing European and North American waters under strongly differing temperature regimes. Thus, the mussel is an excellent model of a species which is able to cope with increasing water temperatures expected under global change. We study three principle scenarios for successful survival of the mussel under rising temperatures: (1) no adaptation to future thermal conditions is needed, existing performance is great enough; (2) a shift (adaptation) towards higher temperatures is required; or (3) a broadening of the range of tolerated temperatures (adaptation) is needed. We developed a stochastic individual-based model which describes the demographic growth of D. polymorpha to determine which of the alternative scenarios might enable future survival. It is a day-degree model which is determined by ambient water temperature. Daily temperatures are generated based on long-term data of the River Rhine. Predictions under temperature conditions as recently observed for this river that are made for the phenology of reproduction, the age distribution and the shell length distribution conform with field observations. Our simulations show that temporal patterns in the life cycle of the mussel will be altered under rising temperatures. In all scenarios spawning started earlier in the year and the total reproductive output of a population was dominated by the events later in the spawning period. For maximum temperatures between 20 and 26<c2><b0>C no thermal adaptation of the mussel is required. No extinctions and stable age distributions over generations were observed in scenario 2 for all maximum temperatures studied. In contrast, no population with a fixed range of tolerated temperatures survived in scenario 3 with high maximum temperatures (28, 30, 32<c2><b0>C). Age distributions showed an excess of 0+<c2><a0>individuals which resulted in an extinction of the population for several thermal ranges investigated.},

abstract={Although the introduced zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, has eliminated most native unionid populations within the lower Great Lakes, some recent surveys have found diverse unionid communities in several Lake Erie coastal wetlands. In 2004, we tested whether fish predators reduced zebra mussels on Quadrula quadrula (Unionidae) in a Lake Erie coastal wetland. In June, we placed unionids and colonization plates in small-mesh exclosures (2.5-cm x 2.5-cm mesh), large-mesh exclosures (5-cm x 10-cm mesh), and open exclosures (2.5-cm x 2.5-cm mesh with two 40-cm x 40-cm openings). Zebra mussels and other benthic molluscs were sampled in October, and zebra mussel numbers on Q. quadrula outside exclosures were significantly higher in October than in June. Densities of zebra mussels on Q. quadrula and colonization plates were much higher in small-mesh and large-mesh treatments that excluded large fish than open treatments. Mean ( plus or minus 1 SE) densities of zebra mussels/unionid were also higher inside (1041 plus or minus 103) than outside (6.9 plus or minus 1.5) exclosures in October. These results indicate that large-bodied molluscivores (e.g., common carp, freshwater drum, channel catfish) can limit zebra mussel numbers in coastal wetlands. Densities of other molluscs (Sphaeriidae, Corbiculidae, Gastropoda, and Unionidae) were not different in sediments of exclosures and uncaged areas, suggesting that fish can have a greater impact on numbers of attached zebra mussels than benthic molluscs.},

title={A Dreissena Risk Assessment for the Colorado River Ecosystem},
abstract={Executive Summary Nonnative zebra and quagga mussels (Dreissena polymorpha and Dreissena bugensis, respectively; see photo above) were accidentally introduced to the Great Lakes in the 1980s and subsequently spread to watersheds of the Eastern United States (Strayer and others, 1999). The introduction of Dreissena mussels has been economically costly and has had large and far-reaching ecological impacts on these systems. Quagga mussels were found in Lakes Mead and Havasu in January 2007. Given the likelihood that quagga mussels and, eventually, zebra mussels will be introduced to Lake Powell and the Colorado River at Lees Ferry, it is important to assess the risks that introduction of Dreissena mussels pose to the Colorado River ecosystem (here defined as the segment of river from just below Glen Canyon Dam to Diamond Creek; hereafter CRE). In this report, I assess three different types of risks associated with Dreissena and the CRE: (1) the risk that Dreissena will establish at high densities in the CRE, (2) the risk of ecological impacts should Dreissena establish at high densities in the CRE or in Lake Powell, and (3) the risk that Dreissena will be introduced to tributaries of the CRE. The risk of Dreissena establishing within the CRE is low, except for the Lees Ferry tailwater reach where the risk appears high. Dreissena are unlikely to establish at high densities within the CRE or its tributaries because of high suspended sediment, high ratios of suspended inorganic:organic material, and high water velocities, all of which interfere with the ability of Dreissena to effectively filter feed. The rapids of Grand Canyon may represent a large source of mortality to larval Dreissena, which would limit their ability to disperse and colonize downstream reaches of the CRE. In contrast, conditions within the Lees Ferry tailwater generally appear suitable for Dreissena establishment, with the exception of high average water velocity. If Dreissena establish within the CRE, the risks of negative ecological impacts appear low. If Dreissena are able to attain moderate densities in Lees Ferry, estimates of filtration capacity indicate they are unlikely to substantially alter the composition (e.g., nutrient concentrations, suspended organic matter concentrations) of water exported from Lees Ferry. Further, a moderate density of Dreissena within Lees Ferry may actually increase food available to fishes by increasing habitat complexity and stimulating benthic production. If Dreissena attain moderate densities in the CRE mainstem, which seems unlikely, ecological impacts will probably be comparable to Lees Ferry-an increase in benthic production. Dreissena may have ecological impacts on the CRE, if they become established in Lake Powell and substantially alter the composition of water released from Glen Canyon Dam; however, it is unclear whether changes in the composition of water released from Glen Canyon Dam will have a net positive or negative impact on food availability in the CRE mainstem. The risk of Dreissena introduction to tributaries appears low. None of the tributaries have upstream lakes or reservoirs that could actually serve as a source population for Dreissena; reservoirs on the Little Colorado River may eventually support Dreissena, but they are far up in the watershed and the segment of river connecting them with the mainstem CRE is intermittent. If the CRE mainstem is colonized by Dreissena, there are no significant vectors for transporting them upstream into the tributaries. In addition, lethally high summer water temperatures make it unlikely that Dreissena will establish in many tributaries. Lake Powell is a logical focus for management and research efforts, given that maintenance of Dreissena populations within the CRE will require an upriver source population and the uncertainty associated with the downstream impact of changes in Lake Powell water quality.},

title={Evidence for Remote Effects of Dreissenid Mussels on the Amphipod Diporeia: Analysis of Lake Ontario Benthic Surveys, 1972-2003},
abstract={The status of invasive dreissenid mussels (Dreissena polymorpha and D. bugensis) and native amphipods (Diporeia spp.) in Lake Ontario was assessed in 2003 and compared with historical data. D. polymorpha (zebra mussels) were rarely observed in 2003, having been displaced by D. bugensis (quagga mussels). D. bugensis expanded its depth range from 38 m depth in 1995 to 174 m in 2003 and this dreissenid reached densities averaging 8,000/m super(2) at all sites < 90 m. During the same time period, Diporeia populations almost completely disappeared from 0-90 m depth, continuing a declining trend from 1994-1997 reported in previous studies. The average density of Diporeia in the 30-90 m depth interval decreased from 1,380/m super(2) to 63/m super(2) between 1997 and 2003. Prior to 2003, areas deeper than 90 m represented a refuge for Diporeia, but even these deep populations decreased, with densities declining from 2,181/m super(2) in 1999 to 545/m super(2) in 2003. Two common hypotheses for the decline of Diporeia in the Great Lakes are food limitation and a toxin/pathogen associated with dreissenid pseudofeces. The Diporeia decline in deep waters preceded the expansion of D. bugensis to these depths, and suggests that shallow dreissenid populations remotely influence profundal habitats. This pattern of decline is consistent with mechanisms that act from some distance including nearshore dreissenid grazing and downslope transport of pseudofeces.},

title={The influence of anthropogenic disturbance and environmental suitability on the distribution of the nonindigenous amphipod, Echinogammarus ischnus, at Laurentian Great Lakes coastal margins},
abstract={Invasion ecology offers a unique opportunity to examine drivers of ecological processes that regulate communities. Biotic resistance to nonindigenous species establishment is thought to be greater in communities that have not been disturbed by human activities. Alternatively, invasion may occur wherever environmental conditions are appropriate for the colonist, regardless of the composition of the existing community and the level of disturbance. We tested these hypotheses by investigating distribution of the nonindigenous amphipod, Echinogammarus ischnus Stebbing, 1899, in co-occurrence with a widespread amphipod, Gammarus fasciatus Say, 1818, at 97 sites across the Laurentian Great Lakes coastal margins influenced by varying types and levels of anthropogenic stress. E. Ischnus was distributed independently of disturbance gradients related to six anthropogenic disturbance variables that summarized overall nutrient input, nitrogen, and phosphorus load carried from the adjacent coastal watershed, agricultural land area, human population density, overall pollution loading, and the site-specific dominant stressor, consistent with the expectations of regulation by general environmental characteristics. Our results support the view that the biotic facilitation by dreissenid mussels and distribution of suitable habitats better explain E. ischnus' distribution at Laurentian Great Lakes coastal margins than anthropogenic disturbance.},

title={ENDOSYMBIONTS OF DREISSENA POLYMORPHA IN IRELAND: EVIDENCE FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF ADULT MUSSELS},
abstract={Although zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) have invaded waters across Europe for over 200 years, they colonized Ireland only within the past decade. To test the hypothesis that Ireland was colonized by adult D. polymorpha, we examined mussels from different sites along the Lower Shannon River system in Ireland for the presence of host specific and generalist endosymbionts.Within the mantle cavity and/or associated with zebra mussel tissues we found species specific-ciliates (Conchophthirus acuminatus and Ophryoglena hemophaga) and generalist symbionts (the ciliate Ancistrumina limnica, nematodes, oligochaetes and chironomids). We found a significant difference in the prevalence of symbionts among sites, but all mussels at all sites harboured one specialist species C. acuminatus, and all of the mussels at three of the four sites also had the second specialist, O. hemophaga. Thus, with the introduction of D. polymorpha into Ireland, at least two additional species, their host-specific symbionts C. acuminatus and O. hemophaga, have also been introduced. The presence of these symbionts in Ireland supports the hypothesis that adult zebra mussels were introduced into Ireland, rather than larval stages. This contrasts with the introduction of zebra mussels to North America, where adult zebra mussels are devoid of host-specific symbionts.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to document and model the population dynamics of zebra mussels Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas, 1771) in Pool 8 of the Upper Mississippi River (UMR), USA, for five consecutive years (1992-1996) following their initial discovery in September 1991. Artificial substrates (concrete blocks, 0.49 m 2 surface area) were deployed on or around the first of May at two sites within each of two habitat types (main channel border and contiguous backwater). Blocks were removed monthly (30 <c2><b1> 10 d) from the end of May to the end of October to obtain density and growth information. Some blocks deployed in May 1995 were retrieved in April 1996 to obtain information about over-winter growth and survival. The annual density of zebra mussels in Pool 8 of the UMR increased from 3.5/m 2 in 1992 to 14,956/m2 in 1996. The average May-October growth rate of newly recruited individuals, based on a von Bertalanffy growth model fitted to monthly shell-length composition data, was 0.11 mm/d. Model estimates of the average survival rate varied from 21 to 100% per month. Estimated recruitment varied substantially among months, with highest levels occurring in September-October of 1994 and 1996, and in July of 1995. Recruitment and density in both habitat types increased by two orders of magnitude in 1996. Follow-up studies will be necessary to assess the long-term stability of zebra mussel populations in the UMR; this study provides the critical baseline information needed for those future comparisons.},

title={Zooplankton Prey Availability and Inferred Diet of Age-0 Lake Whitefish, Spanning the Introductions of Benthic Filter Feeders and a Predatory Zooplankter to Lake Ontario},
abstract={In the eastern basin of Lake Ontario, lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) have exhibited dramatic declines in growth and abundance since 1995. Declines among age-0 whitefish may be attributed to reduced parental investment in reproduction, altered lake thermal regime, or reduced availability of zooplankton prey during a period of extensive ecological change. Among these changes were the introductions of 2 benthic filter feeders (Dreissena polymorpha & Dreissena bugensis) in 1991 and 1993, and a predatory cladoceran (Cercopagis pengoi) in 1998. Dreissena sp. are believed to have reduced zooplankton densities in the Great Lakes by limiting the availability of algal production. In Lake Ontario, C. pengoi are thought to have reduced the abundance and production of small zooplankton in 1999 and 2000, and have been observed in the stomachs of age-0 and planktivorous fishes. Using a size-based approach to analyze the zooplankton community, we present age-0 whitefish stomach content data and prey electivity indices measured in 2003 and 2004, and time series of age-0 whitefish catch-per-unit-effort and zooplankton density collected between 1979 and 2004. We evaluate whether Dreissena sp. and C. pengoi may have restricted the availability of zooplankton prey to age-0 whitefish, and discuss potential impacts to year-class strength.},

abstract={1. We used long-term data and a simulation model to investigate temporal fluctuations in zebra mussel populations, which govern the ecological and economic impacts of this pest species. 2. The size of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) population in the Hudson River estuary fluctuated approximately 11-fold across a 13-year period, following a cycle with a 2-4 year period. 3. This cycling was caused by low recruitment during years of high adult population size, rapid somatic growth of settled animals, and adult survivorship of 50% per year. 4. Adult growth and body condition were weakly correlated with phytoplankton biomass. 5. The habitat distribution of the Hudson's population changed over the 13-year period, with an increasing proportion of the population spreading onto soft sediments over time. The character of soft-sediment habitats in the Hudson changed because of large amounts (mean = 34 g DM m super(-2)) of empty zebra mussel shells now in the sediments. 6. Simulation models show that zebra mussel populations can show a range of long-term trajectories, depending on the balance between adult space limitation, larval food limitation, and disturbance. 7. Effective understanding and management of the effects of zebra mussels and other alien species depend on understanding of their long-term demography, which may vary across ecosystems.},

title={The larvae of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) in the estuarine transition zone of the St. Lawrence: spatial and temporal distribution, impacts and carbon sources},
abstract={The St. Lawrence estuarine transition zone (ETZ) is a productive ecosystem supporting a larval fish nursery. Since 1994, zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) have invaded this region and their larval veligers have become the dominant zooplankton during the summer (up to 260 individuals L super( -1)). Their seasonal dominance of the zooplankton community caused much concern about their potential impacts on the ETZ food web. Much information is available on the impacts of adults on aquatic food webs; however there is a paucity of information on their larval veliger stage, particularly concerning their distribution, the carbon sources they use, their impacts on food webs and their capacity to use dissolved organic carbon (DOC) as adults have been shown to do. Consequently, the overarching objectives of this research were to determine: (1) their impacts on the structure of the pelagic microbial community through their dominance and grazing pressure; (2) the role the ETZ plays in the context of a large river system; (3) the environmental factors controlling the distribution of veligers across the ETZ (freshwater to saltwater); (4) the carbon sources assimilated by the veligers in situ; (5) the trophic role they play in the ETZ food web; and (6) the veligers' capacity to directly assimilate DOC and use this carbon source in the ETZ. The microbial variations observed in the microbial community structure cannot be ascribed to the veliger invasion. The ETZ appears productive enough to support these dominant invaders and despite minor changes in the biovolume size spectrum, the microbial community remains dominated by autotrophs, in the picoplankton and nanoplankton size classes, and the cell concentrations of microbial components have remained similar to pre-invasion values. Grazing by the abundant ETZ zooplankton, salinity, and hydrodynamic retention are the environmental factors controlling the structure and composition of the microbial community from freshwater to saltwater across the transition zones. According to the traditional view of rivers as longitudinal continua, the ETZ inserts itself as a discontinuous segment within the St. Lawrence River corridor. The sharp gradients in the environmental variables incur abrupt changes in the structure of the planktonic community. The veligers' longitudinal distribution was limited by salinity, with maximum decreases in concentration at 2[per. A sharp decline in prey availability at >2[per may be a secondary stressor for the veligers, in addition to the direct effects of salinity. Their vertical distribution was homogeneous throughout the water column, even in the presence of a pycnocline. Redundancy analysis revealed that veliger concentrations were positively correlated with temperature and turbidity and negatively correlated with salinity and total phosphorus. Veligers were also positively correlated with chlorophyll a and picophytoplankton concentrations, suggesting little effect on their phytoplankton prey. Moreover, the veligers were positively correlated with the sestonic ratio of particulate to total phosphorus, indicating their positive association with good food quality. The veligers appear to have no severe negative impacts on the ETZ plankton community and are restricted to favourable conditions (high seston quality) for their survival in the upstream, low salinity region of the ETZ. We evaluated by stable isotope analysis the trophic structure of the ETZ food web and the trophic role played by the veligers. d super(13 )C ranged from -31.2[per (seston) to -16.1[per (adult fish) and d super(15)N ranged from 2.6[per to 17.9[per. Isotopic analysis of samples indicated that the overall food web was largely supported by autochthonous phytoplankton rather than by allochthonous terrestrial carbon. Large differences among the isotopic signals of veligers, cladocerans and copepods suggested the use of different proportions of food items, and the isotopic values of fish larvae indicated no significant assimilation of veligers. The d super(13)C signature of the veligers was in a range consistent with feeding on free-living bacteria and DOC or both, and freshwater algae incubated in situ. To investigate the possibility of DOC uptake by the veligers, veligers were incubated with super(14)C-labelled algal lysates. There was rapid uptake of DOC and incorporation into biomass, equivalent to 6% of the soft tissue dry weight per hour. Zebra mussel veligers are likely using autochthonous DOC as an alternate food source, and they occupy an exotic trophic position in which there is little direct interaction with other major components of the ETZ food web.},

title={Ecology of the Hudson River Zooplankton Community},
abstract={Zooplankton in the Hudson River estuary include both freshwater and estuarine species and range in body lengths from microns to millimeters. Measurements of abundance and biomass as well as community rate processes indicate that zooplankton do not generally exert significant grazing pressure on phytoplankton. In addition, recycling of nutrients by zooplankton is not significant to primary producers because concentrations of dissolved nutrients are quite high in the Hudson and controlled by other processes. Zooplankton do provide an important linkage in the food web as they are key prey items for many young-of-year fish as well as fish that are primarily planktivorous throughout life. Long-term observations indicate many zooplankton populations undergo regular seasonal cycles in abundance, typically with increases during warm, low-flow periods of the year. The invasion of the zebra mussel into the Hudson had strong impacts on zooplankton in the freshwater section of the estuary. Microzooplankton such as rotifers declined dramatically. Cladocerans also declined in annual average abundance between pre- and post-zebra mussel periods when the effects of wet and dry years are taken into account. Zebra mussels, however, had little effect on larger zooplankton. Regulation of zooplankton appears to be a function of physical forces that affect population residence times as well as food and predators. Evidence for food limitation is mixed. Some species benefit from food supplements in experimental trials, but the reduction of phytoplankton biomass in association with the zebra mussel invasion had no effect on clado-ceran egg production. There are a variety of potential predators, and calculations indicate fish exert high rates of mortality on zooplankton. Direct measures of predatory mortality and a better understanding of benthic-pelagic interactions are important topics for future research. In addition, we raise the general question of how strongly zooplankton interactions with predators and prey are coupled in the food web. If interactions are weak, changes such as species invasions or large interannual variation in fish populations may not impact the zooplankton, and thereby, propagation of effects up and down the food web could be highly attenuated.},

abstract={Two invasive freshwater mussels, Dreissena <c2><a0>rostriformis <c2><a0>bugensis (quagga mussel) and D.<c2><a0>polymorpha (zebra mussel), reveal differences in patterns and timing of their invasions in Europe.

As such, the guaqqa mussel has environmental requirements that differ from the congeneric D.<c2><a0>polymorpha. D.<c2><a0>rostriformis <c2><a0>bugensis invasions were confined to reservoirs of the Dnieper, Don and Dniester Rivers of the Black Sea basin. We recorded D.<c2><a0>r.<c2><a0>bugensis outside the Black Sea basin for the first time between 1992 and 2001, along the Volga River reservoir cascade including the Northern Caspian Sea shallows. This represents a 40-year invasion time lag since an invasion corridor through the Volgo-Don Waterway was established in 1952 (a corridor used extensively by many invertebrate species from the Black Sea region). We attribute the postponed invasion of Europe by D.<c2><a0>r.<c2><a0>bugensis, including peculiarities in establishment and its absence in fossil records, to its phylogenetically close relationship with D.<c2><a0>r.<c2><a0>distincta and its recent evolutionary origin. The relatively rapid range expansion of D.<c2><a0>r.<c2><a0>bugensis in eastern Europe during the past several decades was facilitated by human-mediated ecosystem transformation, notably impoundment of large eastern European rivers, that have allowed this species to utilize newly transformed ecosystems.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Another invasive bivalve species: The green mussel, Perna viridis},
abstract={Bivalves as biological invaders have received considerable attention, owing to the success of species like the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha. Some invaders have become fishery or aquaculture pests while others have themselves become fisheries. Still other invaders, such as the green mussel, Perna viridis, have fishery potential but may also damage existing fisheries or aquaculture. In its presumed native range, from the Persian Gulf to the Philippines, P. viridis is known both as a fishery and as a costly fouling organism. It has been introduced throughout the Indo-Pacific, appeared in the Caribbean in 1989 and, by 1999, had invaded Florida, USA. P. viridis initially spread south from its point of origin in Tampa Bay, Florida, with prevailing coastal currents. In 2002 it invaded northeast Florida and has spread north to at least Georgia, but has not yet invaded southeast Florida. Prior invasion patterns and laboratory tolerance trials suggest cold temperatures will limit northward range expansion to the Gulf of Mexico and the southeastern United States. P. viridis attains fishery size within a year and forms dense monocultures. It is a recreational fishery in the Tampa area of Florida but health concerns related to harmful algal blooms are still unresolved. In addition, P. viridis out-competes the native and ecologically important eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica. C. virginica has been almost entirely displaced on offshore structures and most oyster reefs in Tampa Bay have been overgrown by P. viridis, eradicating adult oysters. Impacts on other benthic communities appear to be highly spatially variable.},

abstract={Unionid (Mollusca: Unionidae) densities have declined dramatically throughout the Laurentian Great Lakes after the introduction of dreissenid mussels (Mollusca: Dreissenidae). Recent surveys in some Great Lake coastal wetlands have found abundant unionid populations, but the factors that reduce zebra mussels on unionids in these habitats are not well understood. In 2001-2002, we tested effects of predation and unionid burrowing on corbiculids, sphaeriids and dreissenids in a Great Lake coastal wetland in western Lake Erie. In one experiment, we reduced access by molluscivores using exclosures with two mesh sizes (1.3<c2><a0>cm<c2><a0><c3><97><c2><a0>1.3<c2><a0>cm; 5<c2><a0>cm<c2><a0><c3><97><c2><a0>10<c2><a0>cm) and sampled bivalves after 15<c2><a0>months. Small mesh exclosures had higher numbers of dreissenids, Corbicula fluminea and sphaeriids (54.9, 3.8, 22.6 individuals/m^sup 2^, respectively) than large mesh exclosures (0.0, 1.13, 0.13 individuals/m^sup 2^, respectively) or open controls (0.3, 1.0, 0.1 individuals/m^sup 2^, respectively). Numbers of dreissenids on C. fluminea were higher in small mesh exclosures (3.8 dreissenids/Corbicula) than in large mesh exclosures (0.1 dreissenids/Corbicula) or cageless controls (0dreissenids/Corbicula). In a second experiment, we held two species of live unionids (Leptodea fragilis, Quadrula quadrula) and immobile Pyganodon grandis shells in exclosures (2.5<c2><a0>cm<c2><a0><c3><97><c2><a0>2.5<c2><a0>cm mesh) with either 5<c2><a0>cm, 10<c2><a0>cm, or 20<c2><a0>cm deep sediments and sampled bivalves after 2<c2><a0>months. There were fewer dreissenids on L. fragilis than P. grandis shells, but there was no difference in the number of dreissenids on Q. quadrula and P. grandis shells. Numbers of attached dreissenids were higher inside (189-494 dreissenids/unionid) than outside (8-11 dreissenids/unionid) exclosures, and densities of sphaeriid and C. fluminea clams were also higher inside (21.8, 4.7 individuals/m^sup 2^, respectively) than outside (0.4, 0.9 individuals/m^sup 2^, respectively) exclosures. Numbers of attached dreissenids were higher on unionids that could burrow below the sediments (20<c2><a0>cm depth) than unionids in shallow sediments (5<c2><a0>cm depth) for unexplained reasons. Our data suggest that molluscivores can play a pivotal role in limiting numbers of bivalves including dreissenids in coastal wetlands.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Grazing on colonial and filamentous, toxic and non-toxic cyanobacteria by the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha},
abstract={Colony forming and toxic cyanobacteria form a problem in surface waters of shallow lakes, both for recreation and wildlife. Zebra mussels, Dreissena polymorpha, have been employed to help to restore shallow lakes in the Netherlands, dominated by cyanobacteria, to their former clear state. Zebra mussels have been present in these lakes since they were created in the 19th century by the excavation of peat and are usually not considered to be an invasive species. Most grazing experiments using Dreissena have been performed with uni-cellular phytoplankton laboratory strains and information on grazing of larger phytoplankton taxa hardly exists. To gain more insight in to whether D. polymorpha is indeed able to decrease cyanobacteria in the phytoplankton, we therefore performed grazing experiments with zebra mussels and two species of cyanobacteria, that greatly differ in shape: colony forming strains of Microcystis aeruginosa and the filamentous species Planktothrix agardhii. For both species a toxic and a non-toxic strain was selected. We found that zebra mussels cleared toxic Planktothrix at a higher rate than non-toxic Planktothrix, toxic or non-toxic Microcystis. Clearance rates between the other strains were not significantly different. Both phytoplankton species, regardless of toxicity, size and shape, were found in equal amounts (based on chlorophyll concentrations) in the excreted products of the mussels (pseudofaeces). The results show that zebra mussels are capable of removing colonial and filamentous cyanobacteria from the water, regardless of whether the cyanobacteria are toxic or not. This implies that the mussels may be used as a biofilter for the removal of harmful cyanobacterial blooms in shallow (Dutch) lakes where the mussels are already present and not a nuisance. Providing more suitable substrate for zebra mussel attachment may lead to appropriate mussel densities capable of filtering large quantities of cyanobacteria.},

abstract={Abstract Because of growing concern in the Great Lakes over declines in abundance and growth of lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) and declines in abundance of the benthic amphipod Diporeia spp., a workshop was held to examine past and current trends, to explore trophic links, and to discuss the latest research results and needs. The loss of Diporeia spp., a major food item of whitefish, has been a factor in observed declines, particularly in Lake Ontario, but density-dependent factors also likely played a role in Lakes Michigan and Huron. Among the more significant factors attributed to causing declines were overexploitation, predation by and competition with invasive species (i.e., sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax), and alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus)), and degradation of water quality and habitat. With the loss of diporeia, whitefish have been forced to alter forage patterns and feed on benthic organisms that are of lower nutritional value, are less abundant, or are not as readily available (Pothoven et al. 2001). Besides the loss of diporeia, other direct or confounding factors that may also be contributing to the decline in whitefish growth and condition include density-dependent mechanisms, parasitism, climate/temperature changes, and/or food-web shifts other than those related to diporeia.},

title={Potential Economic Impacts of Zebra Mussels on the Hydropower Facilities in the Columbia River Basin},
abstract={The purpose of this study was to estimate costs to the Federal Columbia River Power System hydroelectric projects in the event of a zebra mussel infestation. We estimated hydropower maintenance costs associated with zebra mussels by examining the Bonneville Dam First Powerhouse, costs associated with Asian clam (Corbicula fluminea) control at Bonneville, and a survey of zebra mussel mitigation costs at other hydropower generation facilities in North America. We found that the one-time cost for installing zebra mussel control systems at hydroelectric projects could range from the hundreds of thousands of dollars to over a million dollars per facility. The estimated cost for a hypothetical zebra mussel mitigation strategy, based upon two response scenarios (a sodium hypochlorite (NaOCI) injection system and anti-fouling paint), at 13 select hydroelectric projects, was $23,621,000. The cost per generator was $62,599 for the NaOCI system, and $81,000 for antifouling paint (not including labor). Removal, painting, sandblasting and installation could potentially double antifouling paint treatment costs. We estimated that if a NaOCI system was installed at an "average" size Columbia River Basin facility, assuming intermittent use, annual operating costs would likely not exceed $100,000. Operating costs will vary depending on the facility, degree of infestation, environmental permits, etc. This investigation found that once utilities initiate long-term mussel control programs, they usually become part of routine maintenance at annual, biennial, or longer intervals, depending on how rapidly the mussels recolonize the systems. A detailed management plan is needed to determine the best zebra mussel mitigation and control strategy for the FCRPS. The management plan should detail key agency contacts and coordination; control technologies; permit requirements; costs for the hydroelectric and nuclear facilities, transportation, upstream and downstream fish passage system; and the environmental impacts of likely mitigation technologies. Engineers, biologists and other relevant experts with hands-on experience in developing zebra mussel mitigation strategies should be sought out and utilized.},

abstract={Colonization by dreissenid mussels, Dreissena polymorpha (Zebra) and Dreissena bugensis (Quagga), is one of the more ecologically important events to occur in the Great Lakes during the last decade. Since their introduction into the Great Lakes, dreissenids have colonized both soft and hard substrates to depths of 80 m and reached average densities of 40,000 mussels m super(-2) in the littoral zone. Because of high densities and widespread distribution, they have modified habitats for benthos and fishes and fostered growth and proliferation of non-indigenous species, such as the round goby and a Black Sea amphipod, Echinogammarus. In 2001, we used multibeam sonar to characterize the benthic habitat in Lake Michigan and acoustic remote sensing technology (sidescan sonar and acoustic bottom classification) to extend and extrapolate information on dreissenid distributions from spatially limited observations. These observations were combined with discrete in situ (video and SCUBA) observations in a geographic information system (GIS). We used this system to link dreissenid distribution with substrate type, morphology and depth. These data are critical inputs to modeling the ecological implications of dreissenid filtering on algal biomass and composition in the Great Lakes over changing environmental conditions.},

title={Influence of physicochemical factors on the distribution and biomass of invasive mussels (Dreissena polymorpha and Dreissena bugensis) in the St. Lawrence River},
abstract={Twenty sites along the St. Lawrence River were sampled to determine if the distribution and abundance of invasive mussels (zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) and quagga mussel (Dreissena bugensis)) are explained by physicochemical variables. Calcium concentration, substrate size, and depth independently explaained significant proportions of variation in biomass for both species. Zebra mussel populations occurred at calcium levels as low as 8 mg Ca times L super(-1), but quagga mussels were absent below 12 mg Ca times L super(-1), suggesting that they have higher calcium requirements. Both species increased in biomass with increasing substrate size but displayed contrasting patterns with depth. Using combinations of these environmental variables, stepwise multiple regression models were developed to predict zebra mussel biomass and quagga mussel biomass. The zebra mussel model included calcium concentration, substrate size, and depth (r super(2) = 0.36, P < 0.0001), while the quagga mussel model included only substrate size and depth (r super(2) = 0.32, P < 0.0001). These results suggest that dreissenid mussel abundance (and correlated impacts) will vary predictably across environmental gradients, but the same predictive model will not be accurate for both species.},

abstract={The combined effects of phosphorus abatement resulting from the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement (GLWQA) and invasion by zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) has released nearshore habitats of Oneida Lake, NY from light limitation. Increased water clarity has resulted in the reemergence of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), increased benthic production rates, and had the expected effect of improving habitats for native species along with the unexpected effect of making habitats more vulnerable to invasion by non-native species. In this study, we quantify changes in the distribution of SAV in Oneida Lake in response to increased water clarity with field and hydroacoustic surveys, and aerial photo interpretation (API). Results showed high water clarity and an extensive distribution of SAV in 1916, followed by low water clarity and a limited distribution of SAV during the period of eutrophication. After the GLWQA, a trend of increasing water clarity and reemergence of SAV occurred, and high water clarity and an extensive distribution of SAV followed the arrival of dreissenid mussels. The combined consequences of the GLWQA and dreissenid mussel invasion increased water clarity, SAV, and the importance of benthic production, a process we term benthification.},

title={Seasonal and temporal variability in tissue biochemistry of several freshwater mussel species},
abstract={Freshwater mussel populations are highly imperiled worldwide. In the United States, approximately 70% of native species are in serious decline because of chronic environmental degradation, toxic spills, and the invasion of the exotic zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha). All 70 endangered mussel species recovery plans call for propagation and reintroduction of populations to achieve recovery. Additionally, propagation technology is viewed as a recovery mitigation tool for mussels killed by toxic spills or other anthropogenic impacts. To support successful propagation, baseline information on the nutritional demands of wild freshwater mussels is needed in order to develop suitable diets and feeding regimes for maintaining mussels in captivity. Our goal is to quantify variability in physiologic status of several species of mussels from varying drainages and from different subfamilies. Proximate tissue biochemistry (protein, lipid, carbohydrate, and ash) was monitored in healthy populations of mussels collected from rivers in the Atlantic and Ohio River drainages over a 3-year period. Biochemistry varied seasonally and temporally across the years of study. Biochemistry also differed between the subfamilies of mussels. The mean carbohydrate level (%DTW) of each species was similar; whereas, the relative protein and lipid levels differed between species. These results reflect the reproductive and seasonal conditioning behavior of these animals, and their responsiveness to environmental changes. Until further information becomes available on absolute nutritional requirements, we recommend the following dietary composition for captive freshwater mussel diets: similar to 5%-10% carbohydrate, similar to 20%-40% protein, similar to 30% lipid, and ash similar to 20%.},

title={Effects of hydrology on unionids (Unionidae) and zebra mussels (Dreissenidae) in a Lake Erie coastal wetland},
abstract={Infestation by introduced zebra mussels has extirpated native unionids in many Great Lake habitats. Shallow areas in coastal wetlands are intermittently dewatered by seiches and seasonal water level changes, and we examined how water level fluctuations and sediment characteristics affected interactions among unionids and zebra mussels in a Lake Erie coastal marsh. In 2001 we sampled unionid distributions and measured zebra mussel colonization on PVC plates at I cm, 18 cm and >35 cm water depths. We found a diverse unionid community (15 species) with many juvenile unionids. Unionid densities (0.01 unionids/m(2)) were comparable to other coastal wetlands, but are lower than reported in offshore areas before zebra mussels were introduced. Zebra mussels colonized plates at >3000 individuals/m(2) in some locations. Although >60\% of unionids had byssal threads on their shells, >75\% of unionids had no attached zebra mussels. Therefore, zebra mussels are colonizing unionids, but are not surviving. Unionid numbers and zebra mussel colonization were low in shallow (1-35 cm) water depths, indicating that water level fluctuations limited their distributions. Only two species of unionids were collected in 1-17 cm deep areas, and areas that became mudflats in September had almost no unionids. Numbers of zebra mussels and unionids were not correlated with organic content or silt/clay content of the sediments. Habitat characteristics shared by this wetland and other coastal wetlands that are important refuges of unionids include: a hydrological connection with the lake, areas deep enough for unionids to survive low water levels and soft sediments that allow unionid burrowing.},

title={Pathways and Regulation of Aquatic Nuisance Species into British Columbia's Waterways},
abstract={Aquatic nuisance species are of concern in British Columbia not only because of the extent of the province's marine coastline, but also because of the large network of freshwater lakes and rivers which support commercially important species. There are numerous pathways of introduction of nuisance species into British Columbia's aquatic systems. These include ballast water, the pet and aquarium trade, live seafood and transportation of pleasure boats from the Great Lakes area. There is limited documentation of the status of aquatic nuisance populations in the province. European Green Crab (Carcinus maenas), Zebra Mussels (Dreissena polymorpha), Eurasian Water Milfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum), Purple Loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria), Common Carp (Cyprinus carpio) and Spartina (Spartina alterniflora) are among the nuisance species that have been observed in British Columbia. Review of federal and provincial legislation that are applicable to limiting the intentional introduction of aquatic nuisance species shows that many regulatory gaps exist. For example, Schedule VIII, Section 5 of the Pacific Fisheries Regulations of the Canada Fisheries Act provides a list of prohibited live fish for importation. The adequacy of this list for the purpose of preventing the importation of species that might threaten local indigenous species needs to be examined. Present knowledge of aquatic nuisance species and their pathways of introduction provide a basis for updating some of these regulations.},

abstract={The ultimate goal of this plan is to minimize (and ideally eliminate) the introduction of harmful AIS and remediate the impact of those already in Canada. The plan's underlying principles include incorporating environmental, economic, and social factors in decision making; working cooperatively with all stakeholders; and using science-based techniques to assess the risk of aquatic invasive species. Prevention of harmful new invasions is the first priority, as it is the most cost-effective way to deal with the problem. Once species are established, the task becomes far more complex and costly. The tools used to manage AIS must be carefully analyzed in terms of their effectiveness, how they affect the rest of the ecosystem, their cost, and so on. While some of the tools used to prevent and control harmful introductions vary between pathways, most of them apply across pathways, between jurisdictions, and to a range of species and ecosystems. In this plan, management actions have been organized into four broad categories: legislation, regulation and compliance; risk management ; engaging Canadians; and science.Original Abstract: Le plan dont il est ici question a pour objectif ultime de reduire, et idealement de stopper, l'introduction au Canada d'especes aquatiques envahissantes et de reparer les degats causes par celles qui sont deja etablies.

De toute evidence, la prevention de l'entree au pays de nouvelles especes nuisibles constitue la priorite et la facon la plus rentable de s'attaquer au probleme.

abstract={Despite predictions that the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) invasion of North America would damage fisheries, analyses of actual effects on fish have been few and equivocal. 26 years of data on fish populations in the Hudson River are analyzed to quantify changes associated with the zebra mussel invasion. Based on measurements of changes in the lower food web, it is predicted that populations of open-water fish species (e.g., Alosa spp.) would suffer and populations of littoral fish species (e.g., Centrarchidae) would prosper from the Zebra mussel invasion. It was found that the median decrease in abundance of open-water species shifted downriver away from the Zebra mussel population, whereas those of littoral species shifted up river. Median apparent growth rates fell by 17% among open-water species and rose by 12% in the single littoral species studied. Many of the observed changes were large and involved species of commercial or recreational importance (e.g., American shad (Alosa sapidissima), black basses (Micropterus spp.)). The influence of zebra mussels on fish should vary widely across ecosystems as a function of system morphology, factors that limit primary production, and diets of the fish species.},

title={Dreissenids in Lake St. Clair in 2001: Evidence for Population Regulation},
abstract={Zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha [Pallas]) density was surveyed at 12 stations in Lake St. Clair in September 2001. Lake-wide mean density was 1,824 individuals/m super(2); whole wet biomass was 148 g/m super(2); and dry tissue biomass was 1.23 g/m super(2). Compared to historical data, density did not change significantly, whereas biomass showed a significant downward trend. Our data support the assertion that the zebra mussel population in Lake St. Clair has undergone important changes since the mid-1990s. Some areas of the lake are now juvenile-dominated, others are adult-dominated, and some have a balanced size distribution. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that zebra mussels have changed the lake ecosystem in two ways that have contributed to their own population limits in a density-dependent manner. First is the reduction of adult microhabitat due to the elimination of native mussels from the lake proper. Second is the massive redirection of larval settlement onto a greatly expanded aquatic macrophyte community which senesces and dies at the end of each season, thus decreasing survivorship of juvenile D. polymorpha. If sustained, these recent changes, especially biomass reduction, suggest that the impact of dreissenids on the Lake St. Clair ecosystem will be more moderate in the future.},

abstract={Many observational studies in North American lakes have documented decreases in phytoplankton abundance after the invasion of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha). However, few field experiments have examined in detail the effect of zebra mussels on phytoplankton abundance and species composition over an extended period. Replicated in situ mesocosms were used to evaluate the impact of natural densities of zebra mussels on phytoplankton and ciliate biovolume, and algal species composition over a 5-week period in a habitat that lacked extant mussel populations. Mussel biomass used in the experiment was determined using a regression model based on a data analysis that predicts zebra mussel biomass from total phosphorus concentration. Within 1 week, zebra mussels decreased phytoplankton biovolume by 53% and ciliate biovolume by 71%. The effect of zebra mussels on ciliate biovolume was sustained throughout the study. However, the effect of zebra mussels on phytoplankton abundance gradually waned over the remaining 4 weeks of the experiment, such that the declining effect of zebra mussels could not be explained by a shift towards less edible and/or faster growing algal species. The mussels' declining condition could help to explain the effect observed over the course of the experiment.},

title={Predicting the impacts of an introduced species from its invasion history: an empirical approach applied to zebra mussel invasions},
abstract={1. Quantitative models of impact are lacking for the vast majority of known invasive species, particularly in aquatic ecosystems. Consequently, managers lack predictive tools to help them prioritise invasion threats and decide where they can most effectively allocate limited resources. Predictive tools would also enhance the accuracy of water quality assessments, so that impacts caused by an invader are not erroneously attributed to other anthropogenic stressors. 2. The invasion history of a species is a valuable guide for predicting the consequences of its introduction into a new environment. Regression analysis of data from multiple invaded sites can generate empirical models of impact, as is shown here for the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha. Dreissena's impacts on benthic invertebrate abundance and diversity follow predictable patterns that are robust across a range of habitat types and geographic regions. Similar empirical models could be developed for other invaders with a documented invasion history. 3. Because an invader's impact is correlated with its abundance, a surrogate model may be generated ( when impact data are unavailable) by relating the invader's abundance to environmental variables. Such a model could help anticipate which habitats will be most affected by invasion. Lack of precision should not be a deterrent to developing predictive models where none exist. Crude predictions can be refined as additional data become available. Empirical modelling is a highly informative and inexpensive, but underused, approach in the management of aquatic invasive species.},

title={Review of techniques to prevent introduction of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) during native mussel (Unionoidea) conservation activities},
abstract={Because of the declines in diversity and abundance of native freshwater mussels (superfamily Unionoidea), and the potential decimation of populations of native mussels resulting from the rapid spread of the exotic zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha, management options to eliminate or reduce the threat of the zebra mussel are needed. Relocating native mussels to refugia (artificial and natural) has been proposed to mitigate the threat of zebra mussels to native species. Relocation of native mussels to refugia such as fish hatchery facilities or natural habitats within their historic range, which are unlikely to be infested by zebra mussels, necessitates that protocols be developed to prevent the inadvertent introduction of zebra mussels. Several recent studies have developed such protocols, and have assessed their effectiveness on the health and survival of native mussels during subsequent relocation to various refugia. The purpose of this project is to synthesize and evaluate the current protocols and to develop a set of procedures that resource managers and researchers should consider before conducting conservation activities in zebra mussel infested waters. We found that the existing protocols have many common points of concern, such as facility modification and suitability, zebra mussel risk assessment and management procedures, and health and disease management procedures. These conservation protocols may have broad applicability to other situations and locations. A summary and evaluation of the information in these main areas, along with recommended guidelines, are presented in this article.},

title={FISH-COMMUNITY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES FOR LAKE ERIE},
abstract={The Lake Erie Committee (LEC), representing five fisheries-management agencies comprised of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Ontario have developed a set of fish-community goals and objectives for Lake Erie in accordance with the Joint Strategic Plan for Management of Great Lakes Fisheries (Great Lakes Fishery Commission 1997). Agencies recognized nine guiding principles during development related to selfsustaining stocks, the stock concept, indigenous species, aversion to introductions, preservation and restoration of habitat, preservation of rare and endangered species, recognition of naturalized species, requirement to harvest on a sustainable basis, and recognition of the limit on productivity. Lake Erie has had a long history of fish- community instability and subsequent change in its fisheries. Restoration of fish-community stability can be best achieved through management to promote healthy stocks of top predators, reduction in and/or prevention of the establishment of aquatic nuisance species, and protection and/or restoration of important coastal nearshore and tributary habitats. The LEC endorsed two goals. The first is to secure a balanced, predominantly cool-water fish community characterized by selfsustaining indigenous and naturalized species that occupy diverse habitats, provide valuable fisheries, and reflect a healthy ecosystem. Walleye (Stizostedion vitreum) would be a key predator in the western basin, central basin, and the nearshore waters of the eastern basin. The second goal is to secure a predominantly cold-water fish community in the deep, offshore waters of the eastern basin with lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), and burbot (Lota lota) as key predators. Further, the LEC has endorsed additional objectives concerning desired ecosystem conditions; the composition of fisheries and their link to supporting habitat; contaminants in fish; conservation of genetic diversity and of rare, threatened and endangered species; and the ecology of fish production. The committee strongly endorses the cooperative, inter-jurisdictional approach to fisheries management, as facilitated through the Great Lakes Fishery Commission (GLFC).},

Since 1994, Dreissena polymorpha veligers have become the dominant zooplankton (up to 260 individuals<c2><b7>L super(-1)). The environmental factors controlling their distribution across the ETZ and their potential impact on the plankton were determined. Their horizontal distribution was limited by salinity, with maximum decreases in concentration at 2. A sharp decline in prey availability at >2 may be a secondary stressor for the veligers, in addition to the direct effects of salinity. Their vertical distribution was homogeneous throughout the water column, even in the presence of a pycnocline. Redundancy analysis showed that veliger concentrations were positively correlated with temperature and turbidity and negatively correlated with salinity and total phosphorus. Veligers were also positively correlated with chlorophyll a and picophytoplankton concentrations, suggesting little effect on their phytoplankton prey. Moreover, the veligers were positively correlated with the sestonic ratio of particulate to total phosphorus, indicating their positive association with good food quality. The veligers appear to have no severe negative impacts on the ETZ plankton community and are restricted to favourable conditions for their survival in the upstream, low salinity region of the ETZ.Original Abstract: La zone de transition estuarienne (ZTE) du fleuve Saint-Laurent est reconnue pour sa grande productivite, tel que demontre par son role de pouponniere de larves de poissons.

abstract={Since 1986, three Eurasian invaders, zebra mussels, Eurasian ruffe, and round gobies, have become well established in the Great Lakes nearshore environment, where they now reach high densities. We used laboratory experiments to investigate (1) competitive relationships among yellow perch, gobies, and ruffe, (2) whether growth and foraging of these fish species was affected by zebra mussels, and (3) the vulnerability of these fish species to predation by smallmouth bass. We also investigated their diet and habitat use in the upper Great Lakes. Perch growth was negatively affected by both intraspecific and interspecific competition. The presence of zebra mussels had no effect on growth of perch or ruffe, but may increase goby growth. Perch and ruffe are more vulnerable to predation by bass than gobies. Where food is limiting and predators are abundant, perch and ruffe may be more negatively affected than gobies by increased competition and predation. As zebra mussels, gobies, and ruffe spread in the Great Lakes, their ranges will overlap with perch and other benthic fishes, increasing the demand for common food resources like soft-bodied benthic invertebrates. Increased understanding of potential interactions among these invaders and benthic fishes will better inform fisheries management decisions.},

abstract={An initial failed invasion by the zebra mussel, followed by an abrupt shift to dense populations, is documented for polluted, hypereutrophic Onondaga Lake. The Lake is located in a region of New York subject to high infestation rates by the zebra mussel. Our analysis was supported by: 1) monitoring of multiple life stages of the zebra mussel, including veligers, pediveliger deposition, and adults in the lake and an adjoining source river over a 4-y interval, 2) a quantitative substrate survey of the lake's nearshore zone, 3) in situ growth-rate experiments, and 4) long-term water-quality monitoring data for the lake. Despite the availability of appropriate substrate and food, near-optimal temperature and primary water chemistry requirements, and continuing inputs of veligers since the early 1990s, veliger concentrations (<0.2 individuals/L) and adult densities in the nearshore zone (<1 individual/m super(2)) remained extremely low in the lake through 1998. This failure was caused by the toxic effects on early life stages from high lake concentrations of forms of N, particularly total ammonia (T-NH sub(3)) and free (unionized) ammonia (NH sub(3)), associated with discharges of a domestic wastewater-treatment plant (WWTP). The abrupt shift from extremely low to high densities in the summer of 1999 continued through 2000 (maximum of similar to 65,000 individuals/m super(2)), coincident with abrupt decreases in concentrations of T-NH sub(3) and NH sub(3) associated with increased treatment at the WWTP. Water-quality monitoring data suggested that summertime T-NH sub(3) and NH sub(3) concentrations of similar to 2 and 0.05 mg/L, respectively, were adequate to prevent the development of dense zebra mussel populations in the lake. The establishment of dense populations of zebra mussels in Onondaga Lake may complicate the resolution of impacts/benefits of an ongoing rehabilitation program to remediate domestic waste inputs in the lake.},

Ruffe and gobies may compete among themselves, as well as with native fish, for benthic prey, refuge, and spawning sites. Furthermore, native fishes that have shown population declines, such as Lake Michigan yellow perch (Perca flavescens), may be adversely affected by increased competition for benthic resources. Our objective was to determine potential ecological impacts of the "exotic triad" on the benthic ecosystem and on perch. Laboratory experiments examining competition for habitat and field analysis of gut contents have revealed significant overlap in habitat use and food resources. Ongoing experiments are testing for competition for limited food resources among these fishes in the presence and absence of zebra mussels, which increase habitat heterogeneity and serve as an auxiliary food source for gobies. Our research will lead to an understanding of the potential impacts of the "exotic triad" on the Great Lakes and help to inform fisheries management decisions.},

abstract={We conducted a series of nutrient manipulation experiments over the first 5 y of Dreissena colonization in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron, to evaluate benthic algal nutrient limitation and community composition. We placed nutrient-diffusing substrata in the littoral zone of the Bay during 1991 (early Dreissena colonization) and from 1992 to 1995 (post-Dreissena colonization). The treatments consisted of P, N, and P+N additions, and a control. Chlorophyll a decreased through time from 1992 to 1995. Phosphorus limited biovolume only in 1994. Treatments with P additions had significantly more chlorophyll a than the controls each year after 1992. This result was consistent with an observed decrease in dissolved P throughout the study. Nitrogen additions had no significant effect throughout the 5-y period. Major shifts in species composition did not result from nutrient additions but rather seemed to be consistent with changes in light penetration and Dreissena herbivory. Our data demonstrated that the pre-Dreissena benthic algal community was dominated by tychoplanktonic diatoms (i.e., Aulacoseira granulata and Tabellaria fenestrata), which would be susceptible to filter-feeding Dreissena. Early post-invasion conditions were marked by an increase in light penetration, and benthic algae were dominated by filamentous green algae (mostly Spirogyra sp.). Late post-invasion conditions were marked by a reduction of light caused by planktonic blooms of Microcystis sp., which were resistant to zebra mussel herbivory. The benthic algal dominance shifted to periphytic diatoms (i.e., Gomphonema clevei), which were also resistant to zebra mussel filter-feeding. A new equilibrium may be developing where Dreissena herbivory limits tychoplanktonic diatoms, which promotes Microcystis bloom, which in turn limits Dreissena filtering rates.},

abstract={Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) were accidentally introduced into the United States in 1986. Since then, they have been classified as a nuisance species because: 1) they are introduced; 2) they form large populations; and 3) they out-competenative species. In Ohio, zebra mussels were originally found in Lake Erie. Since then, they have spread to rivers and creeks, including Alum Creek in Westerville, Ohio. This study examines the microhabitat of zebra mussels in a creek, relative to flow characteristics. Changes in flow affect the amount of silt deposited on the substrate in a creek. The distributions of zebra mussels at two sites on Alum Creek are being determined by quadrat sampling. Turbidity, sedimentation rates, depth, and flow characteristics are being measured at each of these sites. If zebra mussels are limited by high amounts of silt deposition, then we would expect them to be absent in pool habitats where silt deposition is greatest, and present in riffle and run habitats where deposition is less. Initial observations have shown that zebra mussels were not found on the tops of rocks in pool habitats where settlement rates of silt were high. However, they were found on the top surface of rocks in riffle habitats where silt deposition was less.},

As ruffe spread to areas with more dense zebra mussel populations, the zone of interaction among zebra mussels, yellow perch, and ruffe will increase and intensify. In the laboratory, the effect of zebra mussel shells on the ability of these fishes to forage on amphipods (Gammarus pseudolimnaeus) and chironomids (Chironomus plumosus) was examined in light and darkness. In 12 h, ruffe consumed more amphipods than did similar-sized yellow perch, particularly in darkness on bare cobble, and in light within zebra mussels. Amphipods decreased activity more in the presence of ruffe than yellow perch. More amphipods were found in zebra mussel shells than in bare cobble, whether or not fish were present. In darkness, when ruffe consumed more amphipods on bare cobble, amphipods became more associated with zebra mussel shells. Although ruffe consumed more amphipods than yellow perch, perch consumed more chironomids than ruffe on bare cobble. The presence of zebra mussel shells altered the relative consumption of invertebrates in some substrate-light combinations. Experiments such as these help to improve understanding of the direct and indirect effects of predation between and among native and non-indigenous species that may exert structuring forces on the nearshore communities of the Great Lakes currently or in the future.},

title={Black Sea - Baltic Sea invasion corridors},
abstract={The Black and Baltic seas are geologically-young, brackish seas, that have undergone drastic changes since the end of the Ice Age in size and shape, hydrological and hydrochemical regimes, and connections with neighbouring seas. Their ecosystems are still undergoing changes, due to maturation processes. Consequently, most animal and plant species living in the Baltic and Black seas are postglacial immigrants, many of them living close to their salinity tolerance limits. The process of natural enrichment of their biota with invading species (spontaneously or by means of passive dispersal) from the adjacent, more saline seas still continues. From a biogeographical point of view, both basins represent isolated "ecological islands", separated from other brackish water bodies by physical and ecological barriers, such as land masses and fully marine waters. These barriers has been breached two hundred years ago, with the construction of the first invasion corridor. An invasion corridor is defined here as a regular human-mediated connection between isolated biogeographical regions, that cuts through natural environmental barriers and enables transfer of alien species. An invasion corridor may be established in different ways e.g., as high volume overseas shipping, transporting species in ballast tanks or on ship hulls, frequent air or surface transportation of species for stocking, seeds, or as an inland waterway. This paper is a brief overview of the history and functioning of the inland aquatic invasion corridors between the Baltic and the Black seas, and including the Caspian and the White seas as parts of the Eastern European system of invasion corridors.},

abstract={The evolution of Dreissena polymorpha took place in changeable conditions in the successive series of Paratethys Great Lakes and Seas and their estuaries. Complicated intraspecific structure of species and sufficient divergence in environmental requirements among its subspecies allows Dreissena polymorpha to inhabit a variety of environmental conditions in its native area, the Ponto-Aralo-Caspian region. The only subspecies, Dreissena p. polymorpha, is known as an amphiatlantic invader in fresh and oligohaline waters of Europe and North America. Wide and fast dispersal and the successful establishment of this subspecies are facilitated both by biological peculiarities of the zebra mussel (e.g. unusual for freshwater bivalve mode of life, wide limits of environmental requirements, genetic polymorphism) and availability of man-mediated vectors.},

title={Responses of Onondaga Lake, New York, to early stages of rehabilitation: Unanticipated ecosystem feedbacks},
abstract={Responses of polluted Onondaga Lake, New York, to early stages of a phased program to rehabilitate the lake from the effects of domestic waste inputs are documented. The analysis is based on more than 10 years of paired monitoring of the effluent (total ammonia and total phosphorus) of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) that discharges to the lake as well as the lake itself (including total ammonia, nitrite, total and dissolved forms of phosphorus, plankton biomass and composition, Secchi disc transparency, and zebra mussel density). Major reductions in total ammonia and total phosphorus loading relative to the preceding decade are reported for the WWTP for the November 1998 through October 1999 interval. Dramatic and, in some cases, unanticipated changes in the lake's water quality and biota in response to the reductions in loading are documented for the April to October interval of 1999 including: (1) major decreases in total ammonia concentrations and improved status with respect to ammonia toxicity standards, (2) development of dense populations of zebra mussels, (3) decreases in fall concentrations of nitrite and improved status with respect to the related toxicity standard, (4) decreases in total phosphorus and total dissolved phosphorus concentrations, and (5) a severe Microcystis (phytoplankton) bloom that caused nuisance conditions and poor clarity. The zebra mussel invasion is attributed to the reductions in total ammonia concentrations to below toxic levels. The Microcystis bloom was probably related to the abrupt increase in the zebra mussel population. Additional reductions in phosphorus loading from the WWTP will be required to limit phytoplankton production and avoid the potential for continued nuisance conditions. Potential complications in resolving lake responses to future reductions in loading associated with the zebra mussel invasion are considered.},

title={River Dissolved Oxygen Model with Zebra Mussel Oxygen Demand (ZOD)},
abstract={The development, calibration, and application of a dynamic two-dimensional mass balance model for dissolved oxygen (DO) for rivers are documented for the first time accommodating the oxygen demand associated with zebra mussels. The test system is a short (2.3 km) phytoplankton-rich section of the Seneca River, N.Y., which is believed to represent an upper bound of the impact of this exotic invader on oxygen resources because of the unusually high population densities and limited turbulent mixing that prevail. Model calibration is supported by comprehensive measurements of DO, which resolve diurnal and seasonal patterns, and various forcing conditions over a four-month period. Wide temporal variations in the areal consumption rate of DO by zebra mussels [zebra mussel oxygen demand (ZOD), g times m super(-2) times day super(-1)] were determined through model calibration. These determinations are supported by closure with earlier estimates based on simple DO budget calculations, and with laboratory biomass-specific oxygen consumption rates published in the scientific literature. Values of ZOD at times (e.g., >50 g times m super(-2) times day super(-1)) were an order of magnitude greater than the sediment oxygen demand associated with organically enriched deposits. The model performs well in simulating important features of the complex patterns of DO observed, including (1) DO depletion across the study section; (2) vertical DO stratification; and (3) diurnal changes. ZOD was the dominant sink for DO over the river study section; it was entirely responsible for the substantial observed DO depletion, and it was the major cause of the DO stratification during periods of low flow. A preliminary extension of the model is demonstrated to be successful in simulating the persistence of DO depletion 15 km downstream. The model is expected to have management utility for this and other phytoplankton-rich rivers that have been, or will be, invaded by zebra mussels.},

abstract={Native unionid mussel populations have recently declined throughout North America as a result of zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) fouling. Periodic cleaning of fouled unionids and cleaning followed by translocation have been suggested as methods for reducing mortality. Leptodea fragilis and Potamilus alatus were used to determine survival, recovery of energetic stores, and accumulation of newly settled zebra mussels after cleaning and replacement in situ. Both species had high survival, and L. fragilis increased energetic stores after cleaning. Elliptio complanata and Lampsilis radiata were used to compare conservation strategies for unionids fouled by zebra mussels. Survival and glycogen content were used to evaluate stress induced by cleaning and replacement in situ, cleaning and translocation, and cleaning, quarantine, and translocation, relative to the stress in fouled unionids and control (never fouled) unionids. New zebra mussel settlement was assessed to estimate the frequency of cleanings needed. Cleaned E. complanata and L. radiata maintained significantly higher glycogen levels and had higher survival than fouled unionids in all treatments; however, 30% of L. radiata died while in quarantine but no E. complanata died. Translocated unionids were difficult to relocate in the riverine refugium. The inability to find translocated unionids, coupled with high survival and energetic stores in cleaned and replaced unionids, indicate that cleaning and replacement is an effective conservation strategy. Cleaning and replacement may be used as the 1st step to conserve small populations of fouled unionids living in environments where food is not limiting and where collection and cleaning are logistically feasible.},

abstract={Round gobies (Neogobius melanostomus), after successfully reproducing in the early 1990s, decimated populations of mottled sculpins (Cottus bairdi) and possibly logperch (Percina caprodes) in the St. Clair River. Studies were conducted during 1994 to determine whether diets of round and tubenose (Proterorhinus marmoratus) gobies overlapped with those of native forage fishes. In the nearshore zone (depth less than or equal to 1 m), round and tubenose gobies, logperch, and rainbow darters (Etheostoma caeruleum) of similar sizes (total lengths < 75 mm) consumed mainly small-sized macroinvertebrates (dipterans, Caenis, and amphipods) during June 1994. Logperch and rainbow darters were present in the nearshore zone only during this month. At the crest of the channel slope (depth = 3 m), round gobies and northern madtoms (Noturus stigmosus) ate mostly ephemeropteran nymphs (Hexagenia and Baetisca), while predation on zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) and other mollusks by round gobies was minimal. Northern madtoms did not feed on mollusks. Diet overlap between round gobies and native fishes was not observed at the channel slope (depth = 5 m and 7 m) due to heavy predation on mollusks by round gobies. Young-of-the-year (YOY) round gobies migrated to deeper water in autumn and became prey of mottled sculpins and northern madtoms. Eggs and YOY of mottled sculpins may have become vulnerable to predation by both round gobies and native fishes in deeper water, since adult mottled sculpins were apparently confined to the channel with limited home range because aggressive round gobies occupied preferred shallow habitat, including spawning sites.},

abstract={The demography of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) and its impacts on native fingernail clams (Sphaeriidae) in Lake Michigan near Michigan City, Indiana were studied from 1992 to 1997 at 5, 10, and 15 m depths. Zebra mussel densities ranged from 0 to 6,209/m super(2), and were greatest at deeper stations. Size-frequency distributions suggest that initial colonization of the Michigan City area occurred in 1991, with adults typically living for 2 to 3 years. Abundance of adult populations may be limited by the sandy habitat typical of the areas studied and the occasional high-energy wave action in the shallow (5 m) near-shore zone of this area. Densities of fingernail clam ranged from 0 to 1,312/m super(2) and were also greatest at deeper stations. Approximately half of the fingernail clams shells between 1 and 2 mm in size were used as substrate for attachment by juvenile and adult zebra mussels, while over 90% of the clams > 2 mm showed attachment by zebra mussels. Overall median densities of Sphaeriidae decreased from 832/m super(2) to 13/m super(2) at the 15 m depth and from 234/m super(2) to 0/m super(2) at the 10 m depth during the study. It appears that zebra mussel colonization caused a dramatic reduction of Sphaeriidae density by 1997 that may eventually result in their loss from the area.},

title={Translocation of zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha Pallas) as a tool to monitor heavy metals in the River Danube},
abstract={Relative methods, which are based on comparisons using controls, appear to be the most reliable methods for monitoring the complex and ever-changing conditions of the river ecosystem. The translocation of mussels to monitor heavy metals, one of the most frequently used active biomonitoring techniques, is the best example of this type of assessment. This technique cannot eliminate all uncertainties associated with the study of local organisms, but it can reduce them significantly. The methods developed for smaller streams need careful investigation and confirmation before they can be applied to larger rivers. Because of the decrease in local populations and their heterogeneous distribution, active biomonitoring techniques seem to be effective and reliable in monitoring programs for large rivers. Due to its flexible and modular-like construction, the "Dreissena-basket" is easy to handle and provides an appropriate quantity of good quality mussels for analytical procedures in the permanently changing hydrological conditions of a large river. Using this device, many methodological problems can be overcome and the variability accompanied with passive techniques can be reduced. Using the correlation equations of shell length and body weight to calculate the differences between the measured and calculated body weight, we could differenciate between seasonal changes and changes in environmental conditions. It seems that within the narrow size range of selected mussel groups, small changes in dry weight could be disregarded as factors resulting from changes in heavy metal concentrations in the soft tissues. A way to decrease variability caused by dry weight changes is to recover the test animals and to replace them by new stocks of mussels collected in the same consecutive periods. Thereby, mussels can monitor both shorter and longer events of pollution. Both the longer sections and the hot spots of pollution in the Danube could be discovered using Dreissena baskets". The northern border section (1,842 rkm), the sections of the Medve-Nagymaros (1,806-1,695 rkm) and the Paks-Mohacs (1,532-1,447 rkm) proved to be polluted by most of the heavy metals studied. These sections are adjacent to the most industrialized regions of the Slovak Republic and Hungary.},

abstract={We studied the macroinvertebrate fauna of a rocky shore in the freshwater tidal Hudson River during 1992-1994, the early years of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) invasion. The macroinvertebrate community was numerically dominated by chironomids, nematodes, oligochaetes, gastropods, zebra mussels, and planarian flatworms. The community was a mixture of species typical of stony warm water rivers and lake shores, freshwater generalists, and semiterrestrial species. Overall macroinvertebrate densities were moderate to low (2,800-14,600 m super(-2)). Density was a strong function of season and elevation, with consistently low densities in the early spring and in the intertidal zone. This pattern suggests that physical harshness (alternating submergence and desiccation; ice and low temperatures) limits the distribution of invertebrates at this site. Zebra mussels occurred at our study site chiefly below the low tide mark, but only at moderate abundance (usually <1,000 m super(-2)). A weak correlation between the densities of zebra mussels and those of other macroinvertebrates nonetheless suggests that the zebra mussel invasion may have affected community structure.},

The predominantly Canadian commercial fishery had a landed value in 1996 of $1.5 million (Canadian). Nutrients have declined in Lake Ontario, and the recent invasion of zebra and quagga mussels has caused changes in how nutrients are cycled through food webs. These changes have decreased alewife productivity. Alewife biomass reached a 20-yr low in 1997, and further declines are likely.},

Mortality was negligible in all aerated controls. Mean hypoxia tolerance in D. polymorpha ranged from 3-4 days at 25[degrees]C to 38-42 days at 5[degrees]C. Hypoxia tolerance time of zebra mussels increased significantly with declining test temperature (P < 0.001) and increasing acclimation temperature (P < 0.001). Larger zebra mussels were more tolerant than smaller individuals. Asian clams were 2-7 times more tolerant of hypoxia than zebra mussels, surviving a mean of 11.8 and 35.1 days at 25[degrees]C and 15[degrees]C, respectively, and without mortality for 84 days at 5[degrees]C, and were not influenced by temperature acclimation. At 25[degrees]C, larger specimens of Asian clams were less tolerant of hypoxia than smaller individuals. Both species are amongst the least hypoxia tolerant freshwater bivalve molluscs, reflecting their prevalence in well-oxygenated shallow water habitats.

abstract={A comprehensive research project was conducted in Hargus Lake, Ohio, from 1993 to 1996 to investigate the consequences of zebra mussel colonization in this small thermally stratified reservoir. This project comprised long-term monitoring of lake physicochemical and biological parameters and a series of in situ experiments. Four major study areas were covered: (1) the effects of lake stratification and associated hypolimnetic hypoxia on zebra mussels' survival and growth. (2) the grazing impact of zebra mussels on phytoplankton. (3) the role of zebra mussels in sedimentation and nutrient removal. (4) the impacts of zebra mussel colonization on lake thermal and oxygen structures. Lack of solid substrates was the limiting factor of zebra mussel colonization in Hargus Lake, though hypoxic conditions negatively influenced zebra mussels' growth and survival. The grazing impact of zebra mussels on phytoplankton was very limited, largely due to their limited accessibility to phytoplankton and high degree of refiltration under relatively static hydrodynamic conditions. a new approach was developed to evaluate zebra mussels' in situ effective clearance rate that reflects the grazing impact on phytoplankton more accurately than the traditional method using filtration rate estimation. Zebra mussels played a critical role in accelerating the sedimentation of suspended particles and nutrients, making the water clearer. The water clearing process was further assisted by expanded growth of macrophytes, which benefitted from and contributed to improved water clarity. in response to increased light penetration, water temperature and dissolved oxygen in the epilimnion increased. All these interactions cooperated to produce a series of positive feedback processes, which resulted in simultaneous increases in mussel density, macrophyte distribution and epilimnion depth. The changes in lake thermal, oxygen structures and nutrient dynamics are more profound to the lake ecosystem than the direct trophic interactions involving zebra mussels. It is concluded that the impacts of zebra mussels should be assessed from a broad ecosystem perspective.},

abstract={Since 1980 the management of Lake Erie water quality has been predicated on the assumption that phytoplankton communities are P-limited. Our past research using 8 L experimental enclosures indicated zebra mussels (ZM) are selective grazers that release large quantities of phosphate which may stimlate growth of inedible cyanophytic phytoplankton (e.g. Microcystis). The purpose of this study was to determine whether ZM released sufficient quantities of available P to relieve natural phytoplankton assemblages from P-limitation. We compared phytoplankton communities in the western basin of Lake Erie at sites that differed in density of ZM populations, sampling the water column of each site both at 1 m depth and at a stratum 1 m above the bottom. We assessed P-limitation of phytoplankton using physiological characteristics: phosphate uptake rate, P-debt, and Phosphorus Deficiency Index (PDI). We found that phytoplankton communities in the vicinity of dense ZM populations are significantly less P-limited than similar communities removed even by several meters. Our findings suggest ZM are able to affect natural phytoplankton assemblages as they affect phytoplankton under experimental conditions in small enclosures, but this effect is not widespread. This study was supported by Ohio Sea Grant and Lake Erie Protection Fund.},

Recent changes such as increase in zebra mussel abundance and light intensity may have altered environmental conditions of the lake to favor certain algal species. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of light intensity on the benthic recruitment to summer algal bloom in western Lake Erie. Phytoplankton samples were collected every meter from the surface to the bottom at two sites of the western Lake Erie biweekly between June and August in 1996. The shallow site has a rocky bottom with maximum depth of 5 m, while the deep site has a muddy bottom with maximum depth of 13 m. Light intensity was also measured every meter at both sites meter with underwater quantum sensor.

abstract={Experiments and field surveys were conducted in Hargus Lake (Ohio, U.S.) to investigate the effect of lake stratification on the survival, growth and distribution of zebra mussels. During the lake stratification period, relatively stable temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO) gradients persisted across the water column, allowing us to examine the chronic effect of hypoxia on zebra mussels. Zebra mussels were incubated in cages and suspended at different depths in the water column at both pelagic (max. depth = 12 m) and littoral (max. depth = 3.5 m) sites from April 18 to September 28, 1994. No mussel survived to the end of the experiment in cages greater than or equal to 5.5 m, whereas the highest survival rate (76%) occurred at 5 m depth where temperature and DO remained fairly stable for at least 3 months. The threshold oxygen level for survival was between 1.0-1.7 mg 1 super(-1) when water temperature was at about 17-18 degree C. While zebra mussels' survival rate was not affected under the sublethal hypoxic conditions, their growth was greatly retarded by poor water quality. The field survey showed that the zebra mussels and macrophytes had about the same distribution and their biomasses were positively related. The percentage of mussels in aggregates increased towards their maximum distribution depth. The maximum distribution depth of the naturally occurring zebra mussels was only 2.8 m, whereas the adult mussels could survive the entire stratification period when being artificially placed on the 3.5 m bottom, and young mussels could colonize the 3.5 m bottom if solid substrates were provided. We conclude that lack of substrate, rather than hypoxia, was the limiting factor of zebra mussel distribution above 5 m depth in Hargus Lake.},

abstract={Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha), an exotic bivalve were discovered in Oneida Lake, NY in 1991. Some researchers have speculated that the changes that zebra mussels cause may have negative consequences for fish populations in the Laurentian Great Lakes and adjacent inland waters because they may direct energy from the pelagic to benthic zones. I studied the effects of zebra mussel introduction on the benthic invertebrates and yellow perch (Perca flavescens) of Oneida Lake. Yellow perch are ecologically important and support popular sport fisheries in Oneida Lake and many other North American Lakes. The effects that zebra mussels have had on aquatic systems can best be classified as ecosystem engineering. Ecosystem engineers are organisms that alter habitat or control availability of resources to other organisms. The most striking effect that zebra mussels had on Oneida Lake was a significant increase in water clarity and light penetration into the water column. This is a lake-wide effect, not limited to the areas near mussel clusters. Densities of two grazing benthic invertebrates increased in shallow, relative to deep areas, but absolute density, did not exceed historical levels. Laboratory experiments and field data also suggest that increased light penetration may increase the foraging success of yellow perch on zooplankton and benthic invertebrate prey. Experiments show that mussel clusters have had local scale effects on invertebrate density and the foraging success of yellow perch. Invertebrate density rises in response to zebra mussel shell density. Yellow perch foraging success decreased in the presence of mussel clusters. Long-term data do not suggest that there has been a change in consumption of benthos or zooplankton by YOY yellow perch. The number of YOY yellow perch did not change in association with zebra mussel introduction, but growth rates have increased. Neither the number, nor the growth rates of adult yellow perch have changed since zebra mussel establishment. Thus, it does not appear that my hypothesis concerning increased consumption of benthic invertebrates by yellow perch was correct. However, I showed that there was no evidence of negative effects of zebra mussel establishment on yellow perch in Oneida Lake.},

Since 1771 more than 2,000 papers on the distribution, taxonomy, biology, ecology, and control of species and subspecies of Dreissena were published in Russia and FSU, however, this work has not been generally available. We review work conducted in the FSU over the last 100 years on the tolerance of D. polymorpha to different abiotic conditions in waterbodies of various types in order to provide non-Russian-speaking scientists access to this rich body of literature. D. polymorpha is one of the few bivalve molluscs well adapted to live from entirely fresh water to brackish waters. Different subspecies appear to have different salinity tolerances, ranging from completely fresh water to 18.5%. Zebra mussels require at least 25% oxygen saturation, although they can survive several days in anaerobic conditions. The quagga mussel, D. bugensis, however, is much more tolerant of low oxygen conditions. The upper temperature limit for zebra mussels is around 32-34 degree C. Zebra mussels are most abundant on hard surfaces, particularly rocky surfaces, and on macrophytes. Water motion, aerial exposure, freezing, and the other physical factors including temperature, salinity, and oxygen affect the distribution of zebra mussels among and within waterbodies. Many of these factors are expected to covary, or differ predictably among waterbodies, driving distribution and abundance patterns as well as patterns of invasibility that we see both within and among waterbodies.},

abstract={This study examines the impact of the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, on the nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton interactions in Oneida Lake. I also explore interactions among lower food web components and juvenile fishes. Zebra mussels were first observed in late summer of 1991, and were established within the benthic community by 1992. I used a six-year data set (1990-95) to analyze trophic interactions with a primary focus on the phytoplankton-zooplankton levels. Differences in measured and estimated parameters among groups of years (i.e., no, low, and high zebra mussel biomass) were used to determine whether zebra mussels have impacted nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton dynamics. Primary productivity was estimated using the [14] C incubation method in 1993 and 1994. No estimates were available for other years used in the analysis. Therefore, empirically based multivariate equations were developed to predict primary productivity in the other years. Changes that occurred in Oneida Lake after the establishment of zebra mussels included an 86% increase in water clarity. The limiting nutrient, phosphorus, expressed as total phosphorus was variable with no clear trend. Phytoplankton biomass, indexed as chlorophyll a, decreased by 55% from no to high zebra mussel years. Primary productivity did not change significantly throughout the study period but there was a community change to relatively more nanoplankton. A 133% increase in daphnid biomass and a 54% increase in secondary production occurred following zebra mussel invasion. Growth of YOY yellow perch, the main planktivore, increased in response to decline in perch abundance due to increased predation pressure by walleye, and was not a zebra mussel effect. A ten compartment predator-prey model was developed to simulate the response of food web dynamics to zebra mussels grazing on the pelagic system. The model demonstrated that under varying predation pressure from planktivores and a second grazer such as zebra mussels, top-down and bottom-up effects can be induced. The model showed that daphnid populations under most scenarios were more sensitive to predation pressure by planktivores than to loss of resources to a competitor. The model also implicated the importance of detrital pools in regulating stability in an aquatic ecosystem.},

abstract={The effects were examined of 4 levels of chronic hypoxic stress at 3 different temperatures on the survivorship of Dreissena polymorpha and Corbicula fluminea to assess the efficacy of O sub(2) deprivation as a macrofouling control treatment and examine if critical hypoxia limits support reported distribution patterns. At 25 degree C, the hypoxia tolerance was examined at P sub(O2) identical with 7.9, 11.9, 15.9, 23.8, and 31.8 Torr or 5, 7.5, 10, 15, and 20% of full air O sub(2) saturation. At 15 degree C, the hypoxia tolerance to 7.9, 11.9, and 15.9 Torr was tested and at 7.9 Torr for 5 degree C treatments. For both species, P sub(O2) and temperature influenced survivorship dramatically with increasing survivorship at higher P sub(O2) and decreasing temperatures. At 25 degree C, C. fluminea experienced mortality at 7.9, 11.9, and 15.9 Torr, with LT sub(50) values of 144, 216, and 216 h, respectively, versus 288, 384, and 480 h for the 15 degree C exposures. Dreissena polymorpha treatments had LT sub(50) values of 120, 216, and 216 h at 25 degree C for the 7.9-, 11.9-, and 15.9-Torr treatments versus 26 % mortality after 600 h and 28% mortality after 720 h at 15 degree C. The 7.9-Torr treatments at 5 degree C had LT sub(50) values of 480 h for C. fluminea and 1056 h for D. polymorpha. This study showed that both species displayed broad seasonal variation in hypoxia tolerance and that hypoxia limits may be used to assess infestation risk.},

title={Dispersal and ecological impact of zebra mussels, Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas), in coupled lake-stream systems},
abstract={The zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas), is a recent invader of the Great Lakes and their connected rivers and streams. The author hypothesized that lake- stream linkages were important landscape features determining the distribution of zebra mussels. Streams surveyed in the St. Joseph River basin (Indiana- Michigan) or described in the European literature showed that zebra mussel presence in streams was associated with their presence in an upstream connected lake. Mechanisms affecting zebra mussel spread from lakes to outflowing streams were studied. Zebra mussels colonized Eagle and Christiana lakes (Michigan) in 1991 and their common outflowing stream, Christiana Creek, in 1993. Mussel densities declined exponentially from 1600/m super(2) at the outlet to <1/m super(2) at a site 4 km downstream. Studies were conducted from 1994 to 1996 to determine the cause of this dramatic decline. Physico-chemical conditions were suitable for zebra mussels in Christiana Creek. Mussel growth did not differ between Christiana Lake and sites along the stream, suggesting that food was not limiting. Although veligers were present throughout the stream, the abundance of live, mature veligers declined exponentially downstream. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that veligers were killed by hydraulic stresses (e.g., impaction on hard substrata and shear stress). Veliger mortality increased with longer exposure (i.e., distance downstream) to turbulent flow in Christiana Creek, suggesting that veliger mortality contributed to low recruitment in Christiana Creek. A manipulative experiment showed that macroinvertebrate abundance and taxa richness increased with increasing density of zebra mussels in Christiana Creek. Macroinvertebrates likely responded to the physical structure provided by the mussel shells, as no significant difference existed between live and dead mussel treatments. Lakes are sources of propagules for outflowing streams and lake-stream linkages provide zebra mussels access to large portions of drainage basins. However, colonization in streams appears to be limited to short distances below lake sources, possibly because of in-stream veliger mortality. Thus, zebra mussels may impact streams in a limited area delineated by the zone of highest abundance near the lake outlet.},

abstract={Since the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) colonized the Great Lakes ecosystem, ecologists and managers have expressed concern about potential impacts it would have on native benthic macroinvertebrate communities in lakes and streams. We compared post-Dreissena invasion data (1991-1992) with pre-invasion data (1983) from the same sites in Lake Ontario. Dreissena was the overwhelmingly dominant taxon in 1991-1992. Nevertheless, the overall abundance of other benthic macroinvertebrates, and the number of taxa collected, were greater following establishment of Dreissena. Our study failed to provide evidence that Dreissena has induced a population decline in any non-bivalve taxon that was present in 1983. The invasion of Dreissena and other recent environmental changes appear to have created conditions more favorable for most benthic macroinvertebrate taxa in the nearshore region of Lake Ontario. We also asked why zebra mussels have not colonized many creeks in western New York, some with apparently ideal habitat, that are fed partially by water from the Erie Canal which is a source of Dreissena larvae. Counts of Dreissena larvae and concentrations of chlorophyll a were much higher in the canal than in our study creek, yet water quality, current velocity, and particulate organic carbon concentrations in the creek and the canal were very similar. Four factors appear to limit colonization of creeks by the zebra mussel: 1) Retention of larvae by wetlands through which discharges from the canal often flow, 2) Filtering of phytoplankton and larvae by dense beds of adult zebra mussels often found at the beginning of channels connecting the canal to creeks, 3) Inappropriate food quality (e.g., lack of small-diameter phytoplankton with important fatty acid constituents) reaching creeks from the canal, or 4) Muddy substrates inappropriate for attachment and filter feeding by Dreissena.},

title={International transfer of harmful marine phtoplankton in ships ballast water developments in strategies to minimise environmental and human health risks},
abstract={Ballast water carried internationally in ships amounts to some 10 billion tonnes annually, and is now recognised as a potentially significant vector in the translocation of harmful marine phytoplankton. Although some marine organisms (including notable examples such as the dinoflagellate Gymnodinium catenatum, mollusc Dreissena polymorpha, brown seaweed, Undaria pinnatifida) have established new populations in foreign waters, incompatible local environmental conditions in many receiving ports have not been conducive to survival and subsequent establishment. Consequently, successful invasions have been limited to specific ports. Major international research efforts have been initiated to examine the extent of translocation, to investigate the factors associated with transfer and establishment, and to examine a series of management and treatment options to minimise the risks associated with ballast water discharges. An extensive set of chemical and physical treatment options has been proposed and continues to be explored with the aim of developing practical, safe, cost effective and environmentally effective options that can be considered for short and long term use. In general, chemical treatments have shown little promise, especially for some toxic phytoplankton (such as Gymnodinium catenatum and Alexandrium catenella). Some of the physical options, such as ocean exchange and heat treatment show promise for use in cases where a significant risk of establishment exists. Several basic management practices, as well as novel approaches to new ship design are also being examined. In Australia, a continuing research and demonstration program, initiated by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, and supported by shipowners and researchers is making major progress in the development of effective strategies, and demonstration of various options to minimise the risks associated with potential introductions. Strong links with international research groups and the International Maritime Organisation, as well as a public information dissemination program form part of the overall strategy. This paper will review progress at the local and international level and demonstrate that positive outcomes are beginning to emerge.},

title={Cost-effective method of monitoring ballast water operations: An economic study},
abstract={Exotic species invasion poses not only ecological but also economic problems. Ballast water carried by ships is one of the ways through which these exotic species invade new, alien ecosystems. Open Water Exchange (OWE) is a mandatory requirement for ships entering the Great Lakes after trans-oceanic voyage. The National Invasive Species Act (NISA) of 1996 establishes voluntary compliance with OWE at other U.S. coastal ports also. But OWE is costly and time-consuming, and may sometimes destabilize the ship during the operation. This combined with the knowledge that ships cannot be monitored perfectly may tempt some ships to avoid OWE but report to be in compliance. The paper begins with a brief explanation of the current monitoring scheme in the Great Lakes. This is followed by our proposed improvisations to the current scheme. The model, data sources and results follow. Two case studies, the Great Lakes and Chesapeake Bay, are briefly discussed. The paper ends with conclusions. An important feature to be noted here is that the proposed mechanism can be used in monitoring voluntary compliance of ships also. The model imposes no fines per se on ships but only requires that a proportion of monitoring costs be transferred to ships in non compliance.},

abstract={Since the discovery of the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, in the Great Lakes in 1988 comparisons have been made with mussel populations in Europe and the former Soviet Union. These comparisons include: Population dynamics, growth and mortality rates, ecological tolerances and requirements, dispersal rates and patterns, and ecological impacts. North American studies, mostly on the zebra mussel and a few on a second introduced species, the quagga mussel, Dreissena bugensis, have revealed some similarities and some differences. To date it appears that North American populations of zebra mussels are similar to European populations in their basic biological characteristics, population growth and mortality rates, and dispersal mechanisms and rates. Relative to European populations differences have been demonstrated for: (1) individual growth rates; (2) life spans; (3) calcium and pH tolerances and requirements; (4) potential distribution limits; and (5) population densities of veligers and adults. In addition, studies on the occurrence of the two dreissenid species in the Great Lakes are showing differences in their modes of life, depth distributions, and growth rates. As both species spread throughout North America, comparisons between species and waterbodies will enhance our ability to more effectively control these troublesome species.},

title={The physiological ecology of the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, in North America and Europe},
abstract={The zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas), was introduced into North America in 1986. Initial North America (N.A.) studies suggested that physiological responses varied between N.A. and European populations. However, literature review indicates agreement on most aspects of physiological adaptation including: respiratory responses; hypoxia/anoxia tolerance; salinity limits; emersion tolerance; freezing resistance; environmental pH limits; calcium limits; starvation responses; and bioenergetic partitioning. The main differences among N.A. and European mussels appear to be elevated upper thermal limits and temperatures for optimum growth among N.A. populations. N.A. zebra mussels probably originated from the northern shore of the Black Sea in the warmest portion of the mussel's European range. However, most European physiological data come from northern Europe where populations may be adapted to colder temperatures. Alternatively, N.A. research suggests that mussels may have a capacity for seasonal temperature acclimatization such that responses recorded in warmer N.A. waters may be different from those recorded in northern Europe even after short-term laboratory acclimation. Studies of genetic variation and physiological response among European and N.A. D. polymorpha populations are required to elucidate the basis for physiological differentiation. Recently evolved D. polymorpha has poor resistance adaptations compared to unionacean and sphaeriid bivalves with longer freshwater fossil histories. Poor resistance adaptations make it less suited for stable habitats, instead, its high fecundities, early maturity, and rapid growth are adaptations to unstable habitats where extensive resistance adaptations are of little value.},

abstract={We tested the effects of salinity on movement, byssal attachment, and mortality of smaller (2 cm) zebra (Dreissena polymorpha) and quagga (D. bugensis) mussels acclimated to freshwater, and to 3 and 5 ppt (quagga mussels; QM) or to 4 and 6 ppt (zebra mussels; ZM). Freshwater-acclimated mussels demonstrated a decrease in movement after 48 h in salinities of 7 + ppt (ZM) and 4 + ppt (QM), a decline in byssal attachment at 5 + ppt (ZM) and 3 + ppt (QM), and increased mortality at 6 ppt (ZM) and 4 + ppt (QM). Acclimation to higher salinities at a rate of 1 ppt every 3 d raised the salinities at which movement and attachment were inhibited after 48 h for both mussel species. Zebra mussels survived exposure to 10 ppt with limited mortality (>30%); quagga mussels tolerated up to 8 ppt. Larger zebra and quagga mussels were less likely to move, attach, or survive than were smaller mussels in similar salinities. Additional experiments on the native dreissenid in Chesapeake Bay, Mytilopsis leucophaeata, found that movement, attachment, and mortality were minimally affected by salinities down to 2 ppt for individuals acclimated to 12 ppt, with limited mortality even in fresh water. Some zebra and quagga mussels spawned spontaneously in the experimental bowls during the salinity tolerance experiments. Embryos formed in salinities above about 4 ppt did not survive past the early stages of cell division, even if derived from mussels acclimated to higher salinities. Eggs spawned into fresh water by mussels acclimated to 3 to 6 ppt went unfertilized, ultimately enlarging, then disappearing. We conclude that zebra and quagga mussels can adjust to oligohaline conditions, that they could overlap with M. leucophaeata, but that spawning in the upper estuary may not produce viable embryos.},

title={Impact of zebra mussel invasion on river water quality},
abstract={The biology of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) is reviewed as it relates to water-quality problems in rivers. A relationship between population densities of the zebra mussel and their respiration demands for oxygen is developed, which can be used to support the analysis of the impact of zebra mussel infestation on the oxygen resources of streams and rivers. Dramatic changes in the water quality of the Seneca River, N.Y., a major tributary to Lake Ontario, have been brought about by zebra mussel infestation. These changes are documented from 3 years of monitoring data. The infestation converted the Seneca River from a turbid, phytoplankton-rich, nutrient-depleted system, with nearly saturated oxygen concentrations, to a river with high clarity, low-phytoplankton concentrations, enriched in dissolved nutrients, with greatly undersaturated oxygen concentrations. The degradation of oxygen resources was severe enough to cause violations of New York State standards for daily minimum and daily average concentrations for a number of days in the late summer of 1993. The associated loss in the waste assimilative capacity of the river is confounding waste discharge management and planning efforts in the river basin. This form of degradation is expected for other systems as the zebra mussel infestation spreads. The impact is expected to be greatest in rivers and streams with high concentrations of phytoplankton, large areas of rock substrate, and limited reaeration capacity.},

abstract={We examined the short-term effects of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) on ecosystem processes in late August 1991 in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron. Four 1,600-L enclosures, made of Fabreen with a diameter of 1 m, a depth of 2 m, and closed at the bottom, were used to enclose natural plankton communities. These communities were dominated by diatoms with some chlorophytes, chrysophytes, and cyanophytes. Phytoplankton growth was limited by P-availability. Two enclosures were held as controls, and zebra mussels encrusting unionid shells were suspended in two of the enclosures: one enclosure (HZ) contained approximately four-fold greater numbers of mussels than the other (LZ). The concentration of suspended particles, chlorophyll, and algal biomass in HZ and LZ declined over a 6-day interval. Diatom numbers declined more than other taxa. Phytoplankton growth rates in HZ and LZ increased to near mu sub(max); there was no apparent change in photosynthetic parameters alpha or P sub(max) scaled for chlorophyll. Soluble reactive P (SRP) increased significantly (p < 0.05) in HZ but not LZ. Dissolved organic P (DOP) and ammonium ion were elevated; dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was unchanged in HZ and LZ. The rate of phosphate uptake by bacteria and algae declined to less than 2% of controls; this rate decrease could not be explained simply by grazing losses or isotope dilution. The rate of ammonium regeneration by the plankton and the potential rate of ammonium uptake by the plankton did not differ significantly in HZ or LZ from the control enclosures. Our findings indicate that the zebra mussel can have significant short-term effects on phytoplankton abundance, water transparency, water chemistry and phosphorus dynamics. We propose a model of zebra mussel effects that suggests high densities of zebra mussels may indirectly alter and control those processes that are rate-limited or concentration-limited by nutrient availability.},

abstract={The various life stages of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) were examined during the initial years (1991-93) of the mussel's invasion into Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron. Yearly trends in densities of larvae, newly-settled juveniles, and adults were poorly related. Larval densities were lowest in 1991 and increased each year, but the number of settled juveniles was highest in 1991. Adults increased between 1991 and 1992 and then declined in 1993. Mean adult densities at sites with hard substrates were 11,700, 33,200, and 4,100/m super(2) in each of the 3 years, respectively. Year-to-year variation at individual sites was high and likely a result of recruitment dynamics and spatial patchiness of available substrate. By 1993, densities on hard substrates were generally similar throughout the bay, but length-frequency distributions in the inner and outer bay were quite different. The 1991-cohort was not distinguishable in the inner bay in 1993 either because of poor growth or a limited life span, but this cohort was readily distinguishable in the outer bay. In addition, ash-free dry weight of a standard 15-mm mussel in the inner bay declined 65% between 1991 and 1993. Although food concentrations (chlorophyll and particulate organic carbon) declined to low levels in 1993 and both densities and soft-tissue weight of Dreissena declined, it is not clear whether populations in the bay have peaked and are now at equilibrium with the surrounding environment.},

The upper thermal limit of the quagga mussel may be as low as 25 degree C. Mussels of both species acclimated to 5 degree C were less able to survive at high temperatures (30-39 degree C) than mussels acclimated to 15 or 20 degree C. The reduced upper temperature limit of the quagga mussel implies that it will not be able to expand as far south in North America as has the zebra mussel. Both D. bugensis and D. polymorpha were exposed to three concentrations of NaCl (5, 10, and 20ppt) to test salinity tolerance. No individuals of either species survived beyond 18 days in salinities of 5ppt or higher. No interspecific difference occurred in salinity-induced mortality rate.},

Successful colonization by most of the species reviewed was predictable from habitat requirements and behaviour. Ecosystem disturbance was a factor in the success of some of the colonists but was not an overriding ecological requirement. Perturbations to ecosystem health are more difficult to predict and in most cases were not readily apparent from knowledge about the ecology of invaders or native communities. The main damage to ecosystem health by the species reviewed resulted from competition, predation and habitat modification. Difficulties in predicting both invasions and damage from successful colonists point to the need to prevent non-indigenous species from reaching the Great Lakes basin.},

abstract={Zebra mussels invaded Lake St. Clair in 1986. By late 1990, they occurred throughout the southern and eastern areas of the lake at densities up to 20,000 m super(-2) and typically accounted for 60-90% of the macroinvertebrates. By late 1992, they occurred throughout the lake with a similar maximum density as observed previously. The structure of the aquatic habitat in the eastern basin of Lake St. Clair changed rapidly during this time interval. Water clarity doubled from a maximum of 1.5 to 4.0 m, while chlorophyll a concentrations decreased from 2-4 mu g/L to 0.4-0.8 mu g/L. The phosphorus and silt content of the sediments increased. Macrophytes, previously limited to areas along the northern and eastern shorelines with a water depth <1 m, dispersed into the eastern basin and were found in areas with depths up to 6 m. The occurrence and density of amphipods and several other macroinvertebrates also greatly increased. Removal of seston through the filtering activity of the zebra mussel population is probably the main factor responsible for the improved water clarity, reduced phytoplankton abundance, and altered composition and chemistry of the sediments. A zebra mussel population of about 5,000 m super(-2), which likely occurred in 1989, would theoretically be able to filter the entire volume of the eastern basin in under a day. These changes have consequently promoted the cascade of structural changes observed in the macrophyte and macroinvertebrate communities. These habitat changes suggest that the water quality of the lake has become more oligotrophic.},

abstract={Recent concern about the effects of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) has centered on potential loss of fish production and potential loss of fish edibility. The mussels are thought to cause these effects by diversion of energy flow and alteration of contaminant processing. Because management options are limited to controls on nutrients and fish harvest/stocking, it is important to determine the extent and degree of zebra mussel effects. Some effects of the mussels are obvious in sheltered shallow areas but the effects on the whole ecosystem are not known. A series of research surveys done in 1993 is reported in this paper. The effects of the mussels seem to result in a loss of about 25% of the standing algal biomass in some areas. Although an attempt was made to visit many areas of the lake, more extensive work is needed to find whole ecosystem effects. The difficulty in delineating the effects of the mussels is caused by the coincidental achievement of nutrient loading goals.

abstract={Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron, has been the focus of research investigations into the impact of zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) invasion and proliferation on benthic algal communities. Data were collected on benthic algal biomass, carbon fixation, and resource limitation during the summers of 1991, 1992, and 1993. Filtering activity of zebra mussels was correlated with increased water clarity in Saginaw Bay. The increase in water clarity was associated with increased water column light transmission and proliferations of benthic algal biomass dominated by green filamentous members of the Zygnematales while densities of benthic diatoms declined. Rates of benthic algal primary productivity also increased following zebra mussel proliferation. In situ nutrient bioassays were conducted in the littoral zone of Saginaw Bay during the summers of 1992 and 1993 to identify factors that might limit benthic algal accrual. Nutrient-diffusing substrata were deployed to provide point sources of nitrate, phosphate, and nitrate + phosphate. In 1992 there was no significant difference in algal biomass between nutrient treatments. In 1993 benthic algal growth dominated by Spirogyra responded significantly to phosphate addition added alone or in combination with nitrate. It appears that following zebra mussel invasion the recent proliferations of benthic algae in Saginaw Bay may have shifted from light limitation to phosphorus limitation .},

Lack of data comparing these biomonitors with traditional indicators (native and introduced fish and bivalves) may be limiting their practicality. This study evaluates comparability of zebra mussels, channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) and SPMDs in situ exposure to contaminated river sediments. Mussels, catfish and SPMDs were exposed at 4 sites in the River Raisin, Monroe Harbor, MI. Zebra mussels were analyzed after 4, 10, 18, and 28 days while catfish and SPMDs were analyzed after 28 days. They were exposed to sediments that ranged from 0.4-300 ppm PCBs. Correlation was observed between levels of PCBs accumulated by these biomonitors, sediment concentrations, and exposure. In general SPMDs accumulated higher levels of total PCBs, although they were not very effective in sequestering PCBs with high log K sub(ow)'s. In most cases, zebra mussels and channel catfish bioaccumulated similar levels of total PCBs and individual congeners. Catfish did, however, lose significant amounts of lipid at all sites, and experienced high mortality at the more contaminated sites .},

title={The areal and vertical distribution of Cladophora glomerata in western Lake Erie and its interaction with Dreissena polymorpha: A comparison of the 1980s vs. 1990s},
abstract={Historically the distribution of the attached, filamentous green alga Cladophora glomerata in western Lake Erie has been limited by the availability of hard substrate and sufficient light for colonization. The introduction of the exotic zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) into western Lake Erie has impacted both of these limiting factors. Since both organisms require similar substrate for colonization the interaction/competition between the species is potentially great. The introduction of the filter-feeding zebra mussel has resulted in improved water clarity thus increasing light penetration and potentially expanding the vertical distribution of benthic algae. Field surveys were conducted to determine the areal and vertical distribution of Cladophora during the peak biomass period using SCUBA in the early 1980s, prior to the zebra mussel invasion. The surveys sites were revisited in 1992 and 1993 to determine if changes had occurred in the distribution of Cladophora since the introduction of zebra mussels and to investigate the interaction of Cladophora and zebra mussels on bedrock habitat. The study's primary result was that an increase in water clarity had not resulted in extending the vertical distribution of Cladophora due to competition for substrate with zebra mussels. Cladophora dominated the shallow areas from the splash zone down to approximately 1.5 m where competition for substrate began with zebra mussels. The bedrock lake bottom was generally dominated by zebra mussels at depths greater than 2 m even though adequate light levels were available for Cladophora colonization .},

title={Approaches to the biological control of zebra mussels},
abstract={This paper examines what role biological control techniques may play in the integrated pest management of zebra mussels, Dreissena polymorpha. Predators: Numerous organisms are known to prey on zebra mussels, but each would appear to be of little usefulness in actual control projects. Predators, however, have been reported to significantly reduce localized field populations of zebra mussels and could play an important role in the long-term reduction of zebra mussels in lakes, rivers, etc. Parasites: Very little research has been conducted on zebra mussel parasites. A recent study in the Netherlands, however, has reported a severe and apparently lethal protozoan infection. Future use of parasites as biocontrol agents can not be dismissed. In terms of environmental impact, parasites are ideal control agents since they have been fine-tuned through evolution to be host specific and thus should cause negligible nontarget problems. Parasites, however, often have complex growth requirements and elaborate life cycles; these two characteristics can represent formidable obstacles toward economical mass production-a requirement for commercialization. Toxin-Producing Microbes: A third and novel approach to developing a biological control method for zebra mussels is the screening of microorganisms (primarily bacteria) to find strains that are selectively lethal to these mussels. The microorganisms screened are not truly invasive parasites of zebra mussels, but rather microbes which are fortuitously lethal to zebra mussels when the mussels are exposed to artificially high densities of these microbes or their metabolic byproducts. Once a promising strain is found, these microbes can often be economically mass produced in vitro-a characteristic which can lead to their rapid commercialization. Such a screening process has a clear record of success in the development of microbial insecticides and may well prove valuable for zebra mussel control also. Laboratory data on lethality of bacterial stains will be presented.},

abstract={The following document is from the proceedings of a 1993 zebra mussel workshop, conducted in Baltimore, Maryland. At the workshop, forecasts were presented concerning the future of zebra mussels, Dreissena polymorpha, in the mid-Atlantic states. This publication is devoted to predictions of the probability of invasion by the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha (and the quagga mussel, Dreissena sp.) to specific bodies of water in Virginia. Probability of invasion is divided into risk and susceptibility. Risk refers to the chance, relative to other sites, that a body of water will be inoculated with Dreissena, in sufficient number to establish a population. Inoculation can occur by natural dispersal, but in the mid-Atlantic region is most likely to occur through accidental introduction by humans, especially via boat traffic. Susceptibility of a body of water refers to the probability, based on known physiological requirements, that Dreissena could survive and reproduce. In this publication predictions are made, concerning both risk and susceptibility, for several bodies of water in Virginia.},

abstract={Ecesis interactions of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha pall. 1771) with the native benthic cobble reef community of Lake Michigan resulting in critical benthic associations over space and time, were addressed by investigating similar communities on a seawall adjacent to the Great Lakes Research Facility. The extensive cobble reef areas of Lake Michigan represent the most desirable, natural zebra mussel habitat in the lake. Ectoprocts, sponges, and attached algae are especially abundant in the cobble reef habitat (and also on the seawall study site) and actively compete with zebra mussels for the same limited substrate in Lake Michigan, namely the cobble reef areas that are extensive along the west coast. The seawall did not have any detectable mussels on it during summer, 1991. By midsummer, 1992, density had reached values of > 3500 m super(-2); during early autumn, 1992, density had reached values > 7000 m super(-2). This resulted in the exclusion of ectoprocts, sponges, and the algal community, however, sponges appeared to resist the invasion more than the other forms. In our laboratory cultures, large sponges (6 cm dia.) have grown to the exclusion of the mussels, and this scenario may prevail in nature as well, after the initial mussel population increase subsides.},

Knowledge of its body form is important because it is not only necessary to know that the adult looks like, but how it differs from other nuisance species, especially the closely related "quagga mussel" and the brackish water, Mytilopsis leucophaeta, as well as the Asiatic clam, Corbicula fluminea. The zebra mussel is strongly byssate enabling it live on almost any hard surface but several factors, including material composition, water velocity, and temperature, affect its ability to adhere to hard surfaces. Physical and chemical characteristics of the water must be examined in order to determine the potential for infestation at a facility. Minima and maxima temperatures greatly affect the periods of reproduction and settlement, as well as the growth rates of adults. Most adults live for about 2 years but growth rates vary greatly even within the Great Lakes. Variations will be even greater in the southern United States because of higher average temperatures. Standing crops as high as 500,000 m super(-2) were reached in parts of the Great Lakes. At some sites (e.g. Lake St. Clair), population peak densities occurred about five 5 years after their introduction. High temperatures in warmer climates may not only limit population densities but the period of time needed to reach peak densities. Infestations are interfering with the normal metabolism of native unionid clams and there is potential of the unionid clam populations being reduced or even eliminated from major lakes and rivers in which zebra mussels thrive. Zebra mussels will also infest Asiatic clams which will act as a substrate for zebra mussels in many facilities. Although zebra mussels themselves will help to limit densities of Asiatic clams within facilities, control strategies must include those for Asiatic clams. The control options employed must be compatable with environmental standards for municipalities, states, and federal agencies in order to keep socioeconomic impacts to a minimum.},

title={The Fox River as an avenue for fish dispersal},
abstract={Dispersal of fishes and other organisms along the Fox River has been of interest for two reasons. First, concerns have been raised about the potential for exotic species to spread from Green Bay up to lower Fox River to Lake Winnebago and its tributaries. Indeed, closure of the Rapid Croche lock in 1988 has been followed by the appearance of white perch (Morone americana), sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), and zebra mussels (Driessena polymorpha), in the lower river. Second, a canal dug in the 1800's at Portage, Wisconsin, connected the upper Fox River and the Wisconsin River of the Mississippi River drainage. A number of fishes and other organisms gained access to the Great Lakes drainage through this connection. Those that have dispersed all the way to Green Bay are typical large river species, whereas species typical of smaller streams have been "sidetracked" into the Wolf River drainage. The suitability of the Fox River as a dispersal route has apparently been enhanced through improvements in water quality. Over forty fish species have been collected in recent years in a sea lamprey assessment trap set in the lower river. These include several species typically associated with habitats of high quality.},

abstract={There is increasing evidence that naturally occurring UV-B is an important limiting ecological factor in zooplankton communities. In a natural habitat, Dreissena polymorpha larvae and other planktonic organisms could escape harmful radiation by changing their position in the water column. In a water intake pipe, however, the area is much restricted and escape from artificially-supplied ultraviolet radiation would be unlikely. The critical point in controlling zebra mussel infestation is the settling of the planktonic larvae. Prevention of settling would be the easiest and most cost-effective mechanism to remediate zebra mussel fouling problems. One possible control method, which apparently has not been tested is exposure of the larvae to ultraviolet-B radiation. Veliger larvae of the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha , were collected from Lake Erie and maintained in lake water under natural temperature (20.C) and day length (14 hr light/10 hr dark) conditions. Following acclimation, larvae were transferred to the experimental chamber and subjected to enhanced UV-B radiation. Recent experiments indicate that zebra mussel larvae are negatively affected by enhanced UV-B radiation. There is an increase in mortality above control levels after only 1 hour of exposure, which suggests that mid-range ultraviolet radiation may be effective in reducing larval populations.},

title={The spread of the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha , in the St. Lawrence River, and its potential interactions with native benthic biota},
abstract={Beginning in Oct., 1989, zebra mussels, Dreissena polymorpha , were discovered attached to various substrates in and around the Snell Lock of the St. Lawrence Seaway at Massena, New York. Results suggested that the zebra mussel colony near the locks at Massena did not become established from natural dispersal downstream from Lake Ontario, but more likely from ballast being dumped into the river by a ship going through the locks. A study was designed to monitor the movement of zebra mussels into the section of the St. Lawrence River upstream from Massena, and to gather baseline data on benthic macroinvertebrates that might be affected by this invasion. Native molluscs collected included 26 snail species (Gastropoda), and numerous unionid and sphaeriid clams (Pelecypoda). Unionid clams near the Massena site were frequently covered on their posterior (siphonal) ends with zebra mussels; many heavily covered unionids were dead. Insects collected represented 9 orders and 27 families. Amphipod crustaceans were abundant, but isopods, crayfishes, sponges, bryozoans, Hydra and flatworms generally occurred in smaller numbers. The most abundant animals were cadisflies of the families Brachycentridae and Hydropsychidae. These insects require clean flowing water for feeding, and hard substrates for attachment. Because these requirements closely parallel those of D. polymorpha , strong competition may result as the latter spreads through the river. The results of such competition might have a negative impact on sport fishes that feed heavily on the insects.},

We explore an alternative sampling method in which mussel displacement volume was measured in the field. This method allowed us to sample a large number of sites in lower Green Bay and develop a map of relative zebra mussel densities within this area. To assess whether this method provides ecologically quantifiable results we used a series of lab experiments to test mussel displacement volume as a predictor of filtration rate.},

abstract={Mussel beds are common in many intertidal and subtidal habitats, including sub-Arctic and Arctic regions. Despite their ecological importance, little is known about the demographic processes governing the development of mussel beds and particularly about the synchronization of these processes at different spatial scales. The development of a relatively compact, narrow littoral mussel bed of Mytilus trossulus, extending several hundred m along the shore of Koni Peninsula (Tauyskaya Bay, northern Sea of Okhotsk), was studied for four years during the period 2014<e2><80><93>2017. This model bed was located along an exposed coast with a seasonal sea ice cover. It was used to test the hypothesis that small-scale synchronization exists, i.e., the changes in demographic structure of the population that occur simultaneously within a single mussel bed follow a similar pattern. This hypothesis was rejected. The size structure of the mussel population at the same tidal level changed from being uniform (2014) to being varied in 2015<e2><80><93>2017. The course of development of the mussel population was different at the opposite ends of the bed. The cause of these differences may be unequal levels of recruitment of juveniles in the form of a gradient from one end of the bed to the other over the length of the bed. The gradient was associated with transition from one type of shore dynamic processes to another (accumulation vs. abrasion). Small-scale desynchronization may represent one of the reasons explaining the heterogeneity of mussel populations. The possibility of desynchronization of demographic processes should be taken into consideration when studying the spatial organization and dynamics of mussel beds.},

However, palaeoecological studies relying on these aquatic invertebrates have generally focused on post-glacial lakes, with relatively few applications to floodplain water bodies such as palaeo-oxbow lakes. In this study, zone-level (stratigraphic) trends in Chironomidae and Cladocera assemblage composition were analysed from a small palaeo-oxbow lake in a Central European river valley of Poland. Summer air temperature and hydrological conditions were found to be the main drivers of Cladocera and Chironomidae populations, causing a cascade effect in assemblage composition. At the local habitat scale, there were autecological differences in both taxonomic groups reflecting different responses to abiotic and biotic factors. Specifically, Cladocera responded distinctly to plant vegetation and fish predation during the Late Glacial lake phase, whereas Chironomidae were more sensitive to paludification processes and disappeared in the Northgrippian dry phase of the mire. Both groups indicated fluvial activity of the River Grabia, although the response was different. Also, species richness was higher in the more taxonomically diverse Chironomidae compared to Cladocera. As both groups responded to the same factors in a different way, it is recommended that they should be used in parallel in palaeoecological research studies.},

The introduction and spread of marine non-indigenous species (NIS) via the vessel biofouling pathway may put these values at risk. Over the past two decades, the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) has been proactive in commissioning research focused on the risks associated with vessel biofouling, identification of potential risk vessels, and risk management options. In 2010, MPI consulted on options to manage the biofouling risks on all vessels entering New Zealand waters. In 2014, New Zealand became the first country to introduce mandatory biofouling requirements. Between 2014 and 2018, MPI focused on communicating the requirements to support stakeholder awareness, readiness and uptake. In parallel, MPI commissioned further research to investigate proactive and reactive approaches to biofouling management. Research outcomes were summarized and technical advice provided to inform stakeholders of what constitutes best biofouling management practices. This review summarizes MPI<e2><80><99>s research and technical advice on the risks associated with vessel biofouling and its management, and the procedures followed to produce New Zealand<e2><80><99>s biofouling regulations.

Because these regulations are based on International Maritime Organization guidelines, there is the potential to develop consistent global and domestic practices for managing marine NIS introduction and spread.},

Here we describe the multifaceted consequences of biological invasions on native amphibians and identify potential mechanisms and strategies that could better enable the long-term persistence of native species. IAS can influence amphibian fitness, population size, and community structure via multiple pathways and can exert major, direct impacts through predation, competition, and hybridization. The consequences of indirect impacts, too, such as habitat alteration and the spread of emerging diseases, can be particularly severe in native populations. Native amphibians may respond to IAS by modulating aspects of their behavior, morphology, or life history. Nevertheless, it is still unclear the extent to which phenotypic plasticity and rapid evolution may help native species withstand the impacts of IAS in invaded communities. Practical management strategies focused on prevention, monitoring, and early control are the most effective approaches to allay the impacts of IAS and should be prioritized in proactive conservation plans. Eradications of IAS and mitigation approaches, should IAS become established, are feasible and can greatly improve the status of native populations.},

They have also been a perturbing, though less well-studied, phenomenon in marine organisms, following the recognition of tributyltin (TBT)-induced imposex and population extinctions in (neo)gastropods in the 1970s. Whilst ED impacts in mammals and fish are characterized by mimicry or antagonism of endogenous hormones by environmental contaminants (acting through Nuclear Receptors which are present in all metazoans) much less is known regarding pathways to effects in invertebrates. Despite the absence of a defined steroidal/mechanistic component, the extent, severity and widespread nature of ED-like manifestations and altered sexual characteristics observed in marine invertebrates gives rise to comparable concerns, and have been a long-term component of the MBA's research remit. The manifestations seen in sensitive taxa such as molluscs and crustaceans confirm they are valuable indicators of environmental quality, and should be exploited in this capacity whilst we seek to understand the pervasiveness and underlying mechanisms. In so doing, invertebrate indicators address aims of organizations, such as the EEA, OECD, UNEP and WHO, charged with management and monitoring of chemicals and ensuring that adverse effects on humans and the environment are minimized (Bergman et al., 2013). In view of the recent general declines in marine biodiversity, and the potential contribution of ED-like phenomena, safeguarding against deleterious effects through increased research which links pollutant exposure with reproductive dysfunction among invertebrates, is seen as a high priority.},

title={Framing the concept of invasive species â€œimpactâ€ within a management context},
abstract={Governments and conservation organizations worldwide are motivated to manage invasive species due to quantified and perceived negative ecological and economic impacts invasive species impose. Thus, determining which species cause significant negative impacts, as well as clear articulation of those impacts, is critical to meet conservation priorities. This process of determining which species warrant management can be straightforward when there are clear negative impacts, such as dramatic reductions in native diversity. However, the majority of changes to ecosystem pools and fluxes cannot be readily categorized as ecologically negative or positive (e.g., lower soil pH). Additionally, diverse stakeholders may not all agree on impacts as negative. This complexity challenges our ability to simply and uniformly determine which species cause negative impact, and thus which species merit management, especially as we expand invader impacts to encompass a more holistic ecosystem perspective beyond biodiversity and consider stakeholder perspectives and priorities. Thus, we suggest impact be evaluated in a context that is dictated by governing policies or conservation/land management missions with the support of scientists. In other words, within each jurisdiction, populations are identified as causing negative impact based on the hierarchical governing policies and mission of that parcel. Framing negative impact in a management context has the advantages of (1) easily scaling from individual landscapes to geopolitical states; (2) better representing how managers practice, (3) reflecting invasive species as spatially contextual, not universal, and (4) allowing for flexibility with dynamic ecosystems undergoing global change. We hope that framing negative impact in an applied context aids management prioritization and achieving conservation goals.},

Molecular and morphometric markers revealed useful warning systems in detecting environmental changes, even if causes and mechanisms altering both cellular metabolism and shape morphology are still unclear.

Early detection and rapid response during the early stages of infestation for this invasive species is essential to effectively control populations and prevent new infestations from forming. Techniques within molecular biology allow for more efficient detection of the golden mussel in all stages of development. In addition, the analysis of the genome, transcriptome and proteome of this species makes it possible to identify targets of biotechnological interest, which may be useful for the control of the golden mussel or for the generation of products of technological innovation.

abstract={Conserving biodiversity in the face of ever-increasing human pressure is hampered by our lack of basic information on species occurrence, distribution, abundance, habitat requirements, and threats. Obtaining this information requires efficient and sensitive methods capable of detecting and quantifying true occurrence and diversity, including rare, cryptic and elusive species. Environmental DNA (eDNA) is an emerging technique that can increase our ability to detect and quantify biodiversity, by overcoming some of the challenges of labor-intensive traditional surveys. The application of eDNA in ecology and conservation has grown enormously in recent years, but without a concurrent growth in appreciation of its strengths and limitations. In many situations, eDNA may either not work, or it may work but not provide the information needed. Problems with (1) imperfect detection, (2) abundance quantification, (3) taxonomic assignment, (4) eDNA spatial and temporal dynamics, (5) data analysis and interpretation, and (6) assessing ecological status have all been significant. The technique has often been used without a careful evaluation of the technical challenges and complexities involved, and a determination made that eDNA is the appropriate method for the species or environment of interest. It is therefore important to evaluate the scope and relevance of eDNA-based studies, and to identify critical considerations that need to be taken into account before using the approach. We review and synthesize eDNA studies published to date to highlight the opportunities and limitations of utilizing eDNA in ecology and conservation. We identify potential ways of reducing limitations in eDNA analysis, and demonstrate how eDNA and traditional surveys can complement each other.},

title={Resilience of aquatic systems: Review and management implications},
abstract={Our understanding of how ecosystems function has changed from an equilibria-based view to one that recognizes the dynamic, fluctuating, nonlinear nature of aquatic systems. This current understanding requires that we manage systems for resilience. In this review, we examine how resilience has been defined, measured and applied in aquatic systems, and more broadly, in the socioecological systems in which they are embedded. Our review reveals the importance of managing stressors adversely impacting aquatic system resilience, as well as understanding the environmental and climatic cycles and changes impacting aquatic resources. Aquatic resilience may be enhanced by maintaining and enhancing habitat connectivity as well as functional redundancy and physical and biological diversity. Resilience in aquatic socioecological system may be enhanced by understanding and fostering linkages between the social and ecological subsystems, promoting equity among stakeholders, and understanding how the system is impacted by factors within and outside the area of immediate interest. Management for resilience requires implementation of adaptive and preferably collaborative management. Implementation of adaptive management for resilience will require an effective monitoring framework to detect key changes in the coupled socioecological system. Research is needed to (1) develop sensitive indicators and monitoring designs, (2) disentangle complex multi-scalar interactions and feedbacks, and (3) generalize lessons learned across aquatic ecosystems and apply them in new contexts.},

title={Gridlock and beltways: the genetic context of urban invasions},
abstract={The rapid expansion of urban land across the globe presents new and numerous opportunities for invasive species to spread and flourish. Ecologists historically rejected urban ecosystems as important environments for ecology and evolution research but are beginning to recognize the importance of these systems in shaping the biology of invasion. Urbanization can aid the introduction, establishment, and spread of invaders, and these processes have substantial consequences on native species and ecosystems. Therefore, it is valuable to understand how urban areas influence populations at all stages in the invasion process. Population genetic tools are essential to explore the driving forces of invasive species dispersal, connectivity, and adaptation within cities. In this review, we synthesize current research about the influence of urban landscapes on invasion genetics dynamics. We conclude that urban areas are not only points of entry for many invasive species, they also facilitate population establishment, are pools for genetic diversity, and provide corridors for further spread both within and out of cities. We recommend the continued use of genetic studies to inform invasive species management and to understand the underlying ecological and evolutionary processes governing successful invasion.},

abstract={Invasive species may affect the equilibrium of natural communities, competing for resources and occupying niches of the native biota. Dendrocephalus brasiliensis (DEN) has potential to aquaculture, although its use is concerning, since DEN is allochthone in some regions of Brazil. Here, we aimed to study the possible effects of DEN on three cladocerans Moina micrura (MOI), Macrothrix flabelligera (MAC) and Daphnia laevis (DAPH). We performed microcosm experiments combining different cladoceran species in mono- and polycultures in the presence and absence of DEN by evaluating density, biomass, production, stages of development and turnover. MOI was competitive excluded when in 2-species polycultures with MAC and DAPH, and in 4-species polycultures with MAC, DAPH and DEN together. Since MOI survived when cultured with MAC and DAPH in 3-species polycultures, DEN possibly played a role on MOI suppression. Regarding density, DAPH had a slightly suppression when exposed separately with MOI, although MAC had higher production in the presence of MOI. Development stages with similar body size apparently competed more intensely for resources. Our results indicate that DEN has potential to invade ecosystems, destabilizing native zooplankton communities, since it affected MAC and DAPH, thus altering their competitive advantage, besides contributing to MOI exclusion.},

title={Invasive <i>Potamopyrgus antipodarum</i> (New Zealand mud snails) and native snails differ in sensitivity to specific electrical conductivity and cations},
abstract={When species are introduced to novel environments, abiotic conditions must be suitable for species to become invasive. For example, water chemistry must be acceptable for aquatic non-natives to colonize and persist. In two laboratory experiments, we measured growth and survival of Potamopyrgus antipodarum, a worldwide invasive snail from New Zealand, and two co-occurring native snails [Pyrgulopsis robusta and Galba (Bakerilymnaea) bulimoides group] to contrast the relative sensitivity of the three species to aspects of water chemistry (specific conductivity and concentration of multiple cations). Low conductivity reduced growth and survival of Potamopyrgus but did not affect growth of native snails and only reduced survival of one native species, Pyrgulopsis, at extremely low conductivity. In contrast, neither specific cations nor concentration affected growth and survival of Potamopyrgus, but both affected native snails; Pyrgulopsis, grew more at higher concentrations of cations, and Galba grew nine times faster with added potassium than with added magnesium and had higher survival in concentrated than in diluted solutions. Thus, the invasive and native snails differed in their sensitivity to water chemistry: the invasive snail is more sensitive to conductivity, and the native snails are more sensitive to the concentration of specific cations. Our conclusions are consistent with previous studies and with the distribution of Potamopyrgus in the western USA, and parts of Europe, where density of the invasive snail increases with conductivity. Thus, native snails may be able to escape negative effects of the invasive snails by inhabiting areas with low conductivity, when ion concentrations are sufficient.},

title={Phenotypic plasticity at fine-grained spatial scales: the scorched mussel Perumytilus purpuratus growing on Patagonian rocky salt-marshes},
abstract={Understanding phenotypic plasticity of species at different spatial scales is vital in the current context of an increasing pace of environmental changes. Through this knowledge, it is possible to predict their potential to adapt and/or evolve in face of new environmental conditions such as climate change, and/or to understand their ecological range expansion. In Patagonian rocky salt-marshes, one of the most abundant invertebrate species is the scorched mussel Perumytilus purpuratus. In this system, this mussel can be found inhabiting both vegetated and non-vegetated patches, which differ in critical environmental conditions. We performed a field study evaluating whether mussels growing in vegetated patches differ in shell shape from those growing in adjacent non-vegetated patches. We sampled individuals from both patch types and assessed their shell shape and size using geometric morphometrics. The results showed that mussels from vegetated patches had shells that were more dorsoventrally expanded, anterodorsally restricted and globose in shape than those from non-vegetated patches, which showed the opposite traits resulting in a more elongated shell. The differences found could be driven by the different conditions of temperature, desiccation rate, wave action and population density to which mussels are exposed in each patch type. These results revealed the striking phenotypic plasticity of shell form of this native species at a fine-grained scale, which could be one of the explanations for its success in its ecological range expansion.Alternate abstract: Poder comprender la plasticidad fenot<c3><ad>pica de las especies, a diferentes escalas espaciales, es fundamental en un contexto de crecientes cambios ambientales.

These lakes include the five Laurentian Great Lakes, the three African Great Lakes, Lake Baikal, and Great Bear and Great Slave Lakes.

The analysis revealed only three lakes with significant production trends over the study period, with increases in Great Bear Lake (24% increase over the study period) and Great Slave Lake (27%) and a decline in Lake Tanganyika (<e2><88><92>16%). These changes appear to be related to climate change, including increasing temperatures and solar radiation and decreasing wind speeds.

title={Using Freshwater Bivalves (Corbicula Fluminea) to Alleviate Harmful Effects of Small-Sized Crucian Carp (Carassius Carassius) on Growth of Submerged Macrophytes during Lake Restoration by Biomanipulation},
abstract={Increased recruitment of small-sized fish following biomanipulation by reducing the biomass of plankti-benthivorous fish, not least in (sub)tropical lakes, may deteriorate water quality and thereby potentially hamper the recovery of submerged macrophytes. Filter-feeding bivalves remove suspended particles from the water and may, thereby, somewhat or fully counteract this negative effect of the increasing abundance of small-sized fish. So far, only few studies have investigated the interactive effects of fish and bivalves on water clarity and macrophyte growth. We conducted a 2 <c3><97> 2 factorial designed outdoor mesocosm experiment with two densities of small crucian carp Carassius carassius (low 10 g m<e2><88><92>2 and high 40 g m<e2><88><92>2) and two densities of bivalves Corbicula fluminea (low 204 g m<e2><88><92>2 and high 816 g m<e2><88><92>2). We found significant interactive effect of fish and bivalves on the growth of the macrophyte Vallisneria natans. In the low density bivalve regime, the relative growth rates, root mass, root:shoot ratio and number of tubers were 30.3%, 30.8%, 21.6% and 27.8% lower in the high than in the low density fish treatments, while the decrease was less pronounced in the high density bivalve regime: 1.2%, 8.7%, 2.1% and 13.3%, respectively. Thus, bivalves reduced the negative effects of fish, not least when bivalve density was high. The weaker effects of small fish on plants in the high- than in the low-density C. fluminea regime can be attributed to lower total suspended solids (TSS) and Chl a in the first week of the experiment. Better light conditions further stimulated the growth of benthic algae, potentially increasing the removal of nutrients from the water and reducing fish-driven resuspension of the sediment. In addition, high densities of C. fluminea also enriched the sediment total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) content, favouring plant growth as indicated by an increase in leaf tissue TN and TP contents. Our results demonstrate that filter-feeding bivalves can alleviate harmful effects of small fish by prolonging a clear-water state that facilitates submerged macrophyte growth. Addition of the bivalve C. fluminea can be a promising tool for the restoration of submerged macrophytes in shallow eutrophic lakes, in particular lakes containing small, rapidly reproducing fish that due to their small sizes are not capable of controlling the bivalves.},

abstract={Rocky reefs provide important spawning and refuge habitats for lithophilic spawning fishes. However, many reefs have been lost or severely degraded through anthropogenic effects like dredging, channelization, or sedimentation. Constructed reefs have been used to mitigate these effects in some systems, but these reefs are also subject to degradation which may warrant custodial maintenance. Monitoring and maintenance of natural or constructed spawning reefs are not common practices; therefore, few methodologies have been created to test the effectiveness of such tools. We conducted a literature review to assess available information on maintenance of rocky spawning habitats used by lithophilic fishes. We identified 54 rocky spawning habitat maintenance projects, most of which aimed to improve fish spawning habitats through the addition of spawning substrate (n = 33) or cleaning of substrate (n = 23). In comparison to shallow riverine studies focused on salmonids, we found little information on deep-water reefs, marine reefs, or other fish species. We discuss the possible application of potential spawning habitat cleaning methods from other disciplines (e.g., treasure hunting; archeology) that may provide effective means of reef maintenance that can be used by restoration practitioners.},

title={Two Ocean Pass: An Alternative Hypothesis for the Invasion of Yellowstone Lake by Lake Trout, and Implications for Future Invasions},
abstract={Preventing the interbasin transfer of aquatic invasive species is a high priority for natural resource managers. Such transfers can be made by humans or can occur by dispersal through connected waterways. A natural surface water connection between the Atlantic and Pacific drainages in North America exists at Two Ocean Pass south of Yellowstone National Park. Yellowstone cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri used this route to cross the Continental Divide and colonize the Yellowstone River from ancestral sources in the Snake River following glacial recession 14,000 bp. Nonnative lake trout Salvelinus namaycush were stocked into lakes in the Snake River headwaters in 1890 and quickly dispersed downstream. Lake trout were discovered in Yellowstone Lake in 1994 and were assumed to have been illegally introduced. Recently, lake trout have demonstrated their ability to move widely through river systems and invade headwater lakes in Glacier National Park. Our objective was to determine if lake trout and other nonnative fish were present in the connected waters near Two Ocean Pass and could thereby colonize the Yellowstone River basin in the past or future. We used environmental DNA (eDNA), electrofishing, and angling to survey for lake trout and other fishes. Yellowstone cutthroat trout were detected at nearly all sites on both sides of the Continental Divide. Lake trout and invasive brook trout S. fontinalis were detected in Pacific Creek near its confluence with the Snake River. We conclude that invasive movements by lake trout from the Snake River over Two Ocean Pass may have resulted in their colonization of Yellowstone Lake. Moreover, Yellowstone Lake may be vulnerable to additional invasions because several other nonnative fish inhabit the upper Snake River. In the future, eDNA collected across smaller spatial intervals in Pacific Creek during flow conditions more conducive to lake trout movement may provide further insight into the extent of non-native fish invasions in this stream.},

title={Springs and Springs-Dependent Taxa of the Colorado River Basin, Southwestern North America: Geography, Ecology and Human Impacts},
abstract={The Colorado River basin (CRB), the primary water source for southwestern North America, is divided into the 283,384 km2, water-exporting Upper CRB (UCRB) in the Colorado Plateau geologic province, and the 344,440 km2, water-receiving Lower CRB (LCRB) in the Basin and Range geologic province. Long-regarded as a snowmelt-fed river system, approximately half of the river<e2><80><99>s baseflow is derived from groundwater, much of it through springs. CRB springs are important for biota, culture, and the economy, but are highly threatened by a wide array of anthropogenic factors. We used existing literature, available databases, and field data to synthesize information on the distribution, ecohydrology, biodiversity, status, and potential socio-economic impacts of 20,872 reported CRB springs in relation to permanent stream distribution, human population growth, and climate change. CRB springs are patchily distributed, with highest density in montane and cliff-dominated landscapes. Mapping data quality is highly variable and many springs remain undocumented. Most CRB springs-influenced habitats are small, with a highly variable mean area of 2200 m2, generating an estimated total springs habitat area of 45.4 km2 (0.007% of the total CRB land area). Median discharge also is generally low and variable (0.10 L/s, N = 1687, 95% CI = 0.04 L/s), but ranges up to 1800 L/s. Water pH and conductivity is negatively related to elevation, with a stronger negative relationship in the UCRB compared to the LCRB. Natural springs water temperature and geochemistry throughout the CRB varies greatly among springs, but relatively little within springs, and depends on aquifer hydrogeology, elevation, and residence time. As the only state nearly entirely included within the CRB, Arizona is about equally divided between the two geologic provinces. Arizona springs produce approximately 0.6 km3/year of water. Data on >330 CRB springs-dependent taxa (SDT) revealed at least 62 plant species; 216 aquatic and riparian Mollusca, Hemiptera, Coleoptera, and other invertebrate taxa; several herpetofanual species; and two-thirds of 35 CRB fish taxa. Springs vegetation structure, composition, and diversity vary strongly by springs type, and plant species density within springs is high in comparison with upland habitats. Plant species richness and density is negatively related to elevation below 2500 m. Human population in and adjacent to the CRB are growing rapidly, and ecological impairment of springs exceeds 70% in many landscapes, particularly in urbanized and rangeland areas. Anthropogenic stressors are primarily related to groundwater depletion and pollution, livestock management, flow abstraction, non-native species introduction, and recreation. Ensuring the ecological integrity and sustainability of CRB groundwater supplies and springs will require more thorough basic inventory, assessment, research, information management, and local ecosystem rehabilitation, as well as improved groundwater and springs conservation policy.},

We conducted a comparative study (armoured shore with a retaining wall and a restored shore with a wedge-shaped cobble embankment vs. a pristine shore) at a wind-exposed shore section of Lake Constance. The retaining wall had a number of significant remote effects on the littoral zone, i.e. increased near-bottom current velocities, higher bed-load transport rates, coarsening of surface sediments, reduction in phytomass density, reduction in total densities and number of taxa of macroinvertebrates as well as a significant decline in the percentages of Limnomysis benedeni Czerniavsky, 1882, Ostracoda, Corbicula fluminea O.F.

abstract={Functional traits define an organism in terms of how the organism interacts with its environment and determine the influence the organism has on dynamic ecosystem processes, such as biogeochemical nutrient cycling. Freshwater mussels (Bivalvia: Unionidae) form hotspots of biogeochemical activity in benthic environments by alleviating nutrient limitation at the sediment<e2><80><93>water interface; however, little is known about the influence of mussel functional traits on sediment biogeochemical cycles, particularly nitrogen (N)-removal via denitrification and anammox. Our aim was to model the influence of two mussel functional traits: ammonium (NH4+) excretion and organic matter (OM) biodeposition, on N-removal in stream sediments. We quantified mussel excretion and biodeposition and incubated mussels in microcosms containing river sediment using flow-through methods. We measured nutrient and gas fluxes to quantify real-time ambient N-removal (denitrification<e2><80><89>+<e2><80><89>anammox), and conducted isotope pairing techniques to determine the maximum N-removal potential for denitrification and anammox pathways. NH4+ excretion was shown to be a significant predictor of ambient N-removal, whereas OM biodeposition significantly increased the maximum N-removal potential in the sediment. Our study is the first of its kind to link mussel functional traits specifically to N-removal and contributes to the growing knowledge of the role these highly imperiled organisms play by directly and indirectly influencing ecosystem-scale processes in lotic systems.},

abstract={Lake charr Salvelinus namaycush are endemic to the formerly glaciated regions of North America and spawn primarily in lakes, unlike most other Salmoninae. Spawning habitats for lake charr are thought to be characterized by relatively large substrate particle sizes which provide sufficient interstitial spaces for egg incubation, but little is known about the physical processes that create or maintain suitable habitats. We review the literature on lake charr spawning habitat and present a conceptual framework that examines the roles of physical variables in creating the appropriate conditions for egg incubation. A critical underlying assumption of this framework is that lake charr will select spawning habitats that provide suitable hypolentic flows for egg incubation. We suggest that the characterization of lakebed surface roughness, current patterns, substrate particle size, and groundwater flows at multiple spatial scales may yield significant insight into the physical mechanisms supporting lacustrine spawning habitats for lake charr and will be useful in creating predictive models of these habitats. This framework may also apply to other lake-spawning lithophilic fish species.},

abstract={Unionids have been described as ecosystem engineers capable of affecting the local food web as well as the hydrodynamics, passively and actively. In this study, we perform particle image velocimetry measurements to characterize the flow around a live Amblema plicata using natural sediments as tracer particles under two specific flow rates and orientations i.e., facing upstream and downstream, to understand the interaction between the organism and flow surrounding it. The behavior of the mussel is also quantified under all the above experimental conditions using a hall-effect gape sensor that captures valve motion. The flow measurements show clear variations between the two orientations tested, with the presence of a low velocity region behind the mussel extending beyond the tested field of view for the upstream orientation. In contrast, the flow in the wake of the downstream orientation recovers very quickly to the incoming flow strength. The inspection of the vorticity contours around the mussel also highlights clear differences between orientations, with the structure of a shear layer under the upstream orientation changing to a region of concentrated vorticity near the siphons for the downstream cases. The variation of the net flux through the mussel along with the frequency of partial closures captured by the gape sensor measurements illustrate a potential added bioenergetic cost to the mussel feeding when facing downstream, especially at higher flow speeds.},

We tested the effect of chemical signals: fish predator scent (the roach Rutilus rutilus), conspecific alarm cue and a mixture of both, as well as a mechanical stimulus: the presence of an amphipod (Dikerogammarus villosus) mechanically irritating mussels. The alarm cues and amphipod presence made mussels spend more time with closed/narrowly open valves, which can be related to decreasing detection probability by reduced infochemical excretion and/or protecting soft tissues in the presence of an imminent threat. In contrast, reactions to the predator scent alone were much weaker. Moreover, the fish scent mixed with alarm substance induced weaker responses than the alarm substance alone. Thus, the fish infochemical might mask the presence of the alarm cue components, potentially benefiting the predator. A variety of defences exhibited by mussels demonstrates the importance of the predation cue type (direct/indirect, chemical/mechanical, originating from conspecifics/predators/mixed) for the behaviour of sessile animals.},

title={Microhabitat Heterogeneity and Population Ecology of Ribbed Mussels (<i>Geukensia demissa</i>) Near Their Northern Range Limit (Maritime Canada)},
abstract={Population dynamics of sessile marine invertebrates are potentially affected by variation in abiotic variables among microhabitats. The ribbed mussel (Geukensia demissa), an ecosystem engineer in salt marshes from Cape Cod to northern Florida, inhabits two microhabitats in salt marshes near its northern range limit, Maritime Canada: the exposed seaward edge of the marsh (edge) and the edge of creeks (creek). To determine differences in population dynamics of ribbed mussels between these microhabitats, population, demographic, and abiotic variables were measured at multiple sites over 1 to 2<c2><a0>years. Water flow was higher, temperature less variable, and winter shoreline disturbance less prevalent along creeks than edges. Mussels showed some minor demographic differences between microhabitats: a slightly delayed onset of gametogenesis, and a tendency to lower female reproductive output and more settlers (although overall numbers were low) within creeks. These differences did not translate into consistent differences in population variables across microhabitat types, namely density, size structure, and individual growth of juveniles and adults. Although creeks appear to be more suitable habitat based on abiotic variables measured, mussel population variables may be limited by a combination of temperature and food availability or quality, or some other factor. Overall, population dynamics of ribbed mussels are similar between creek and edge microhabitats in salt marshes in Maritime Canada. This study contributes a first assessment of the dynamics of a potentially key salt marsh species near its northern range limit.},

title={Competition fluctuates across years and seasons in a 6-species-fish community: empirical evidence from the field},
abstract={Competition not only occurs between species, but (probably more importantly) also among individuals within species, especially, for species occurring in high densities and when resources are limiting. Fluctuating densities and dietary overlap may account for massive ecological and evolutionary changes in fish communities. We sampled a mixed juvenile (0+ stages, being younger than 1<c2><a0>year of age) fish community at the Lower Rhine over three consecutive years, including native and newly established species (~<e2><80><89>64,000 captured individuals and ~<e2><80><89>4200 dissected fish). Our aim was to develop a new approach in which data on density, individual consumption rates, and diet overlaps (both intra- and interspecific) solely originating from the natural environment, were used and combined to estimate species-specific competitive strengths within and between seasons and species. The juvenile fish community at the food-limited Rhine was dominated by invasive gobies. Species-specific consumption rates decreased depending on the dietary overlap with other juveniles. Two invasive gobies (Neogobius melanostomus and N. fluviatilis) showed the greatest competitive abilities, followed by a third invasive Gobiid species (Ponticola kessleri) and the native Aspius aspius, a species utilizing an exclusive food source. Both other native species (Perca fluviatilis and Sander lucioperca) had the lowest estimates of food-related competitive strength, indicating that these species are forced into a juvenile competitive bottleneck by the invasive gobies, before they finally can develop into successful predators on gobies later in life. Our new analytical approach to measure dietary competitive strength among individuals provides a powerful tool to empirically study eco-evolutionary feedback dynamics in the field.},

title={Vessel In-Water Cleaning or Treatment: Identification of Environmental Risks and Science Needs for Evidence-Based Decision Making},
abstract={The accumulation of aquatic organisms on the wetted surfaces of vessels (i.e., vessel biofouling) negatively impacts world-wide shipping through reductions in vessel performance and fuel efficiency, and increases in emissions. Vessel biofouling is also a potent mechanism for the introduction and spread of marine non-indigenous species. Guidance and regulations from the International Maritime Organization, New Zealand, and California have recently been adopted to address biosecurity risks, primarily through preventive management. However, appropriate reactive management measures may be necessary for some vessels. Vessel in-water cleaning or treatment (VICT) has been identified as an important tool to improve operating efficiency and to reduce biosecurity risks. VICT can be applied proactively (i.e., to prevent the occurrence of, or to remove, microfouling (i.e., slime) or prevent the occurrence of macrofouling organisms - large, distinct multicellular organisms visible to the human eye), or reactively (i.e., to remove macrofouling organisms). However, unmanaged VICT includes its own set of biosecurity and water quality risks. Regulatory policies and technical advice from California and New Zealand have been developed to manage these risks, but there are still knowledge gaps related to the efficacy of available technologies. Research efforts are underway to address these gaps in order to inform the regulatory and non-regulatory application of VICT.},

title={The lethal effect of hydrotechnical concrete on freshwater Bivalvia},
abstract={Most hydrotechnical buildings under construction demand the concrete mixture to be set directly under water. The main reason for such a procedure is to limit the washing away of the the concrete binding mixture and to increase the efficiency of organisation of work so as to ensure continuity in concreting. The impact on the aquatic environment of recent developments in concrete technology and the use of new components has not yet been established. Natural pebble aggregate containing portland cement and fugacious siliceous ash as a binder was used to prepare BP concrete samples, while concrete marked LB was composed with lightweight aggregate and portland cement as a binder. The aim of this paper was to answer to the question whether hydrotechnical concrete of different compositions (BP and LB) and the technology of setting in a water habitat have any influence on the life condition of commonly occurring Dreissena polymorpha (Mollusca, Bivalvia). The lethal effect of two types of freshly hardening concrete was observed. In the case of LB concrete the lethal outcome for D. polymorpha could be the effect of a considerable increase of electrolytic conduction in the test cultivation. In the case of BP the parameters of electrolytic conductivity and pH did not exceed the values appearing in lakes. The possibility of the occurrence of toxic compounds of D. polymorpha, arising from the reaction of the aquatic / lake environment or the elution of some components should be taken into account. D. polymorpha serves as an indicator of toxicity in the aquatic environment and therefore can be used as a model organism in the analysis of the influence concrete on the natural environment. The results obtained in this study indicate the significant impact of modern chemical composition of concrete on the aquatic environment and the living organisms that cover it. They underline the need for research based on the hydrobiont reaction to the substances used in the natural environment.},

title={Spatial and temporal patterns of foraging activity by breeding Common Scoters (Melanitta nigra) in Scotland},
abstract={Many populations of sea ducks have declined; poor foraging conditions in freshwater breeding habitats could be a contributory factor. The UK breeding population of Common Scoters (Melanitta nigra) declined by 63% between 1995 and 2007, prompting research which showed that lake use by breeding scoters was correlated with food abundance (large invertebrates) and accessibility (shallow water). Building on this earlier work, here we investigate scoter foraging activity at Scottish breeding lakes, in order to better understand declines and inform conservation measures. We hypothesised that foraging effort would (i) be concentrated in shallow water holding large invertebrates, (ii) differ between sexes, and (iii) vary through the season. We recorded scoter foraging activity during 208 c. one-hour watches, at 13 lakes over three years. Water depth and food abundance (invertebrates) were measured. Foraging was significantly associated with shallow water: areas within 10 m of lake shores, typically less than 0.9 m in depth, had 1.9 and 4.1 times more foraging use than expected by chance, for females and ducklings respectively. Where large invertebrates were relatively abundant, the association with shallow water was weaker, implying that abundant food facilitated foraging across a wider range of water depths. Contrary to expectations, males and females expended similar foraging effort on breeding lakes. We discuss various interpretations of this result, and recommend tracking studies to help resolve these. There was no evidence that foraging effort of pre-breeding females or broods varied seasonally. Our study highlights the value of shallow water and large invertebrates to breeding Common Scoters. Conservation action should therefore seek to protect and enhance these habitat elements, for example via management of water levels or fisheries.},

Statistical models indicated a significant increase between sampling periods in the probability of observing cyprinids in pike stomachs, and corresponding significant decreases in the probability of observing perch or brown trout. Small pike were significantly less likely than large pike to have salmonid prey in their stomach. There were seasonal effects on diet, with invertebrates and sticklebacks being consumed more in Winter<e2><80><93>Spring compared to Autumn<e2><80><93>Summer. In the recent period, prey selection indices indicated positive selection for roach and negative selection for perch; indices for trout tended towards neutrality. The dietary shift in pike following the establishment of roach may have alleviated predation pressure on native trout (and perch), with implications for food web structure in invaded lakes.},

title={Enhanced ambient UVB radiation affects post-mating, but not pre-mating sexual traits in a fish},
abstract={Organisms inhabiting shallow aquatic habitats currently experience increasing levels of solar ultraviolet B radiation (UVB). UVB causes damage on cellular and molecular levels and can affect associated life-history traits either through direct exposure or indirectly through oxidative stress generation. We examined UVB effects on pre- and post-mating sexual traits in three-spined stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus). Adult, reproductively non-active males were assigned to two exposure treatments under semi-natural conditions in an outdoor experiment; one group received natural radiation (UVBnormal) whilst the other group received additional UVB (UVBenhanced). After two months, colour metrics were used to quantify male breeding colouration as pre-mating trait. At the post-mating stage, sperm morphology, number and movement as well as testes mass were determined. Males did not significantly differ in sexual ornamentation between treatments, but UVBenhanced fish had smaller testes as well as fewer and shorter sperm than UVBnormal fish. Sperm movement was not significantly different between treatments. However, in UVBenhanced males, linear and progressive movement of sperm was positively correlated with sperm morphology (head-to-tail length ratio), whereas in UVBnormal males this relationship was negative (but not significant). Additionally, there was a significant treatment by body condition interaction concerning head-to-tail length ratio, i.e. head-to-tail length ratio increased with condition in UVBnormal males whereas there was no relationship in UVBenhanced fish. Our findings reveal that increased UVB levels influence post-mating fitness-relevant traits in males whilst having no significant impact on pre-mating sexual traits, suggesting selective<c2><a0>UVB-effects at the gamete level with consequences for reproductive performance.},

abstract={It has been hypothesised that freshwater pollution may favour the establishment of tolerant invaders at the expense of less-tolerant residents. To test this, this study capitalises on the aftermath of a farm pollution incident, a slurry discharge to a small British stream, which eliminated the resident macroinvertebrate assemblage. Stream transplant bioassay experiments at the discharge site revealed a higher pollution tolerance of the invasive amphipod Crangonyx pseudogracilis and the isopod Asellus aquaticus than that of the native amphipod Gammarus duebeni celticus and the invasive Gammarus pulex. A. aquaticus recolonised the stream up to the discharge point within days, followed by C. pseudogracilis, then G. pulex, with G. duebeni celticus undetected after a month. Values of a macroinvertebrate-derived biotic index of organic water quality, the Average Score Per Taxon (ASPT), gradually increased up to the discharge point in the 30<c2><a0>days following the incident. In a larger-scale survey (72 river and 12 pond sites), inclusion/exclusion of Gammarus spp. had no effect on ASPT values, while inclusion of C. pseudogracilis increased values, despite an assumed equivalence of these amphipods in the index. Pollution could facilitate the establishment of tolerant invaders, and this has implications for biomonitoring.},

Previous study in 2004 showed the occurrence of cyanobacterial proliferations, drought, trematode parasites and invasive non-native pulmonate Physa acuta. During the year 2013, we always detected cyanobacterial microcystins (MCs) in gastropods, from 59 to 4149<c2><a0>ng<c2><a0>g<e2><88><92>1 fresh mass (vs. 0<e2><80><93>246<c2><a0>ng<c2><a0>g<e2><88><92>1 in 2004), suggesting a continuous and increased MC intoxication. Environmental intracellular MC concentrations were high (8<e2><80><93>41<c2><a0><c2><b5>g<c2><a0>L<e2><88><92>1) from August to October 2013, whereas they were detected only in August 2004 (17<c2><a0><c2><b5>g<c2><a0>L<e2><88><92>1).

After August 2013, nearly all gastropods disappeared as most other macroinvertebrates (except Chironomidae, Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera). The whole decline of gastropods and other macroinvertebrates, and the absence of trematodes strongly suggest adverse conditions in the study site. Despite acute stressful conditions suggested above, gastropod abundance was 13-fold higher in June 2013 (vs. 2004), reflecting successful recolonization and efficient breeding. Most gastropods exposed to drought and toxic bloom were young vulnerable stages. Thus, we supposed alternation of local gastropod extinctions versus recolonization that could induce, on a long term, a loss of diversity to the detriment of the most sensitive species.},

abstract={Globally, invasive species cause extensive economic damage and are a major threat to biodiversity. Generalist species are particularly dangerous invaders, as they can thrive in degraded habitats and endure environmental stochasticity, often outcompeting more specialized native taxa. Blue catfish Ictalurus furcatus were first introduced into the Chesapeake Bay during the 1970s, and now form dense populations in several tidal rivers. Despite being labeled as a dangerous invasive, the feeding ecology of this species is largely unknown. We used a stratified random design to collect stomachs from 16,110 blue catfish in tidal freshwater, oligohaline, and mesohaline segments of the James, Pamunkey, Mattaponi, and Rappahannock Rivers. Indices of diet breadth and omnivory reveal that blue catfish are generalist omnivores with some of the highest diet breadths ever observed in an estuarine fish species, while trophic level calculations demonstrate that blue catfish are a mesopredator occupying lower trophic levels than previously claimed. Cumulative prey curves revealed that large numbers of stomachs are necessary to adequately characterize the diet of blue catfish, thus previous diet descriptions of this species should be considered with caution. Blue catfish feed primarily on invasive aquatic vegetation and Asian clams, though the economically-valuable blue crab Callinectes sapidus is also consumed regularly. While the per capita impact of blue catfish on imperiled native species appears to be low, this impact could still be substantial due to high population densities.},

The study revealed that epizoic rotifer fauna found on D. polymorpha is relatively abundant and rich in species, different from plankton communities in the same mesocosms, and specific, that is, include species that prefer this habitat. It may also suggest that communities of epizoic rotifers are impacted by the presences of benthic predators, as well as by small fish and large crustaceans inhabiting littoral waters.},

title={Opportunities and Challenges for the Sustainability of Lakes and Reservoirs in Relation to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)},
abstract={Emerging global threats, such as biological invasions, climate change, land use intensification, and water depletion, endanger the sustainable future of lakes and reservoirs. To deal with these threats, a multidimensional view on the protection and exploitation of lakes and reservoirs is needed. The holistic approach needs to contain not just the development of economy and society but also take into account the negative impacts of this growth on the environment, from that, the balance between the three dimensions can be sustained to reach a sustainable future. As such, this paper provides a comprehensive review on future opportunities and challenges for the sustainable development of lakes and reservoirs via a critical analysis on their contribution to individual and subsets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Currently, lakes and reservoirs are key freshwater resources. They play crucial roles in human societies for drinking water provision, food production (via fisheries, aquaculture, and the irrigation of agricultural lands), recreation, energy provision (via hydropower dams), wastewater treatment, and flood and drought control. Because of the (mostly) recent intensive exploitations, many lakes and reservoirs are severely deteriorated. In recent years, physical (habitat) degradation has become very important while eutrophication remains the main issue for many lakes and ponds worldwide. Besides constant threats from anthropogenic activities, such as urbanization, industry, aquaculture, and watercourse alterations, climate change and emerging contaminants, such as microplastics and antimicrobial resistance, can generate a global problem for the sustainability of lakes and reservoirs. In relation to the SDGs, the actions for achieving the sustainability of lakes and reservoirs have positive links with the SDGs related to environmental dimensions (Goals 6, 13, 14, and 15) as they are mutually reinforcing each other. On the other hand, these actions have direct potential conflicts with the SDGs related to social and economic dimensions (Goals 1, 2, 3 and 8). From these interlinkages, we propose 22 indicators that can be used by decision makers for monitoring and assessing the sustainable development of lakes and reservoirs.},

We sampled benthic macroinvertebrates at 48 sites (44 lotic<e2><80><89>+<e2><80><89>4 lentic), and among 236 taxa, 21 NIMS were identified, of which 9 were widespread and abundant. Only 14.6% of sites exhibited no biocontamination, 18.7% exhibited low or moderate biocontamination and 66.7% exhibited high or severe biocontamination. Higher biocontamination in the Drava may be due to both the proximity to the Danube as the main source of NIMS and the existence of three large reservoirs. We found significantly negative correlation between the number of NIMS and native taxa. The significant correlations between biocontamination indices and tested biological metrics were as follows: negative with %EPT, EPT-S, BMWP and IBE AQEM, while positive with HR-SI.

abstract={A comprehensive set of physicochemical variables in near-bottom water and surface sediments, as well as the soft-bottom macrozoobenthic assemblages were investigated at six sites across the Yundang Lagoon (Southeast China) in November 2012. This lagoon was severely damaged in the 1970s due to domestic and industrial pollution and land reclamation and underwent a massive restoration effort over the past 30 years. Our objectives were to: (1) assess the current trophic and environmental condition of the lagoon; (2) investigate the pattern of spatial variation in the macrozoobenthic assemblages; and (3) assess the benthic recovery in relation to the main environmental gradients and the presence of invasive alien species. Nutrient, chlorophyll-a, biological oxygen demand (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand (CODMn), and total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations were lower than those reported in previous decades, yet organically-enriched conditions occurred at an inner site. From azoic conditions in the 1980s and a few benthic species reported prior to this study, we found a significant increase in benthic diversity with 43 species heterogeneously distributed across the lagoon. The invasive bivalve Mytilopsis sallei was the dominant species, which was associated with the richest benthic assemblage. However, M. sallei is a pest species, and its spatiotemporal distribution should be carefully monitored. These results highlight the central role of the macrozoobenthos in providing important ecological information on the current status of the Yundang Lagoon and as an effective biological tool to follow the recovery<e2><80><99>s progress and the future evolution of this highly valued ecosystem.},

By 2018, its distribution area had expanded to 4005.89 ha, which was 2557 times its initial colonization area. The distribution of S. alterniflora in the modern Yellow River Delta at given times and its ecological and biological effects have been studied previously; however, its invasion rate and characteristics, which affect its comprehensive management, are not known. Using multi-resolution and multi-platform remote sensing time series data from 1989 to 2018, combined with years of field data, the invasion of S. alterniflora within the modern Yellow River Delta was studied. These data show that S. alterniflora began to expand rapidly in 2011, after a 22-y incubation period within the modern Y ellow River Delta. Its expansion mainly occurred via seed reproduction. In addition, S. alterniflora preferentially invaded intertidal deltaic areas, using local seagrass beds as colonization sites. There was a significant correlation between the increase in area of S. alterniflora and the decrease in pollutant concentration of the Yellow River. Clearly, the improvement in water quality of the Yellow River accelerated the invasion of S. alterniflora within the delta.},

title={Use of a rapid roadside survey to detect potentially invasive plant species along the Garden Route, South Africa},
abstract={Early detection of emerging or sleeper weeds and monitoring of alien plant invasions forms the foundation of effective invasive alien plant management. Using a rapid roadside survey technique, we aimed to (1) establish a baseline of alien plant distribution and abundance along roads in the Garden Route, South Africa, and (2) identify priority species (particularly sleeper weeds) and priority areas to inform appropriate management action. We surveyed along 530 km of roads and recorded 109 alien and/or extralimital species across 1942 point locations. Of these, 35 species were considered to be sleeper weeds on account of displaying estimated dispersal distances distinctive of invasive plants and not being listed by the South African Plant Invaders Atlas (SAPIA) or regulated by South African legislation. Roads along natural forest and fynbos vegetation (often within the Garden Route National Park) displayed lower incidences of alien plants than those associated with degraded or transformed land, with roads along farmland associated with the highest incidences of alien plants. Roads in the Southern Cape region had more species and higher densities of alien plants than roads in the Tsitsikamma region, and a few species were exclusive to either. Conservation implications : Our inventory contributed significant new records and range extensions to SAPIA, while the identified sleeper weeds offered suggestions for species that may be considered for regulation under the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act of South Africa. We furthermore provided information to facilitate (1) timely management of emerging invasive alien plants, (2) prioritisation of species and areas for management action, and (3) future monitoring of alien plants in the Garden Route National Park and surrounds.},

title={Subtidal Microphytobenthos: A Secret Garden Stimulated by the Engineer Species Crepidula fornicata},
abstract={The slipper limpet Crepidula fornicata is an emblematic invasive species along the northeast Atlantic coast. This gregarious gastropod lives in stacks of several individuals and forms extended beds in shallow subtidal areas. The effects of this engineer species on the colonized habitat can be physical (e.g., presence of hard-shell substrates with uneven topography) or biological (e.g., nutrient enrichment by direct excretion or via biodeposition). We hypothesized that through biological activity, nutrient fluxes at the sediment-water interface are enhanced, leading to stimulated primary productivity by microphytobenthos (MPB) associated with Crepidula beds. To test this fertilization hypothesis, we conducted a 10-day mesocosm experiment using C. fornicata (live and dead) placed on top of sieved and homogenized sediment collected in situ. We used hyperspectral imaging to non-invasively map the development of MPB biomass, and to assess the potential influence of C. fornicata and its spatial extent. Our results showed that live C. fornicata significantly promote MPB growth through both physical and biological effects, with the biological effect dominating over the pure physical one. The highest stimulation was observed on the shells, suggesting that dissolved metabolic products excreted by C. fornicata were likely the main factor stimulating MPB growth in our short-term experiment. Our findings provide first direct evidence that stimulation of MPB growth by the biological activity of larger benthic epifauna occurs not only in intertidal but also in shallow subtidal habitats. More research is needed to assess the contribution of this fertilization effect to the trophic functioning of subtidal benthic systems.},

title={Evaluation, Gap Analysis, and Potential Expansion of the Finnish Marine Protected Area Network},
abstract={Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are considered to be an essential tool for safeguarding marine biodiversity. Sustainable use of the oceans and seas relies on the benefits of MPAs, now even more than ever, due to environmental degradation and anthropogenic impacts on marine ecosystems. Various international and regional agreements require that nations designate sufficiently marine areas under protection. MPAs are powerful tools, if coherent and ecologically efficient. Assessing the functionality of MPA networks is challenging, unless extensive data on underwater species and habitats is available. We evaluated the efficiency of the Finnish MPA network by utilizing a unique new dataset of ~140 000 samples, collected by the Finnish Inventory Programme for the Underwater Marine Environment VELMU. For the evaluation of MPAs, we used comprehensive data on: species distribution and abundance models for over 100 taxa, IUCN Red List of Ecosystems, fish reproduction areas, EU Habitats Directive Annex I Habitats and human pressures. Using the quantitative conservation planning and spatial prioritization method Zonation, we identified sites of high biodiversity and developed a balanced ranking of underwater conservation values. Only 27 % of the ecologically most valuable features were covered by the current MPA network. Based on the analyses a set of expansion sites were identified, complementing the ecological and geographical gaps in the current MPA network. Increasing the protected sea area by just one percent with the selection of the most valuable areas indicated by the analysis, the protection level of biological features could be significantly increased. We also discovered that the EU Directive habitats are not in their present form functional proxies for marine benthic species. This suggests that MPA networks based on habitats are not sufficient for safeguarding marine biodiversity in the northern Baltic Sea. Furthermore, the produced rankings are essentially environmental value maps, they can be used in ecosystem-based marine spatial planning and impact avoidance, including, e.g., siting of wind energy or aquaculture. Our approach and analytical procedure can be replicated elsewhere in the Baltic Sea and in other marine areas around the world, provided sufficient data exists.},

abstract={The aim of this review is to introduce and critically comment the main research topics considered in a selection of papers on the European large perialpine lakes (LPL) presented at the XXXIII congress of the International Society of Limnology in 2016. Besides highlighting ongoing research advancements in the LPL, the review provides a critical overview of the scientific information available on the large lakeâ€™s ecosystems, identifying a few emerging research topics (e.g., aquatic â€˜omicsâ€™ and high frequency monitoring). Many limnological investigations are linked to the concept of scientific monitoring, following a â€œproblem solvingâ€ approach connected with the management of water resources. Experimental studies and modeling are restricted to specific niches. Overall, the scientific knowledge is quite scattered, showing hot-spots of specialized or integrated research in specific lakes and areas. The advancement of new knowledge in the LPL should rely on a better integration of scientific disciplines using multidisciplinary approaches, and on the continuous adoption of new advanced technologies and tools, contributing, besides basic research, to the next generation monitoring approaches. Finally, the preservation of LPL has to rely on water protection policies addressed towards the sustainable development of both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, following the â€œgreenâ€ and â€œblueâ€ infrastructure concepts.},

abstract={Temporal patterns of interspecific interactions and their correspondence with life history events are of key significance for community dynamics, but often overlooked in characterising the mechanisms of species invasions and predicting competitive outcomes. Here, we examine the role of seasonality in moderating interactions between a globally important invasive mysid shrimp (Hemimysis anomala) and an ecologically similar native species (Mysis salemaai) by combining distribution and diet surveys with experimental quantification of comparative resource exploitation rates and mutual aggressive interactions. We found partial overlap in winter, but not summer horizontal distributions of the two species. Diets were highly similar in the seasonally overlapping range, potentially resulting in competition for the high-quality, but seasonally scarce, zooplankton prey in invaded lakes. Despite its smaller size, H. anomala had similar feeding rates to M. salemaai on three key zooplankton prey species. H. anomala was more aggressive toward M. salemaai than M. salemaai was toward H. anomala, although there was no evidence for intraguild predation. Our findings indicate that spatio-temporal niche partitioning permitted invasion by H. anomala and coexistence with M. salemaai, in spite of their high trophic similarity.},

abstract={We provide a comprehensive overview of the status of fish assemblages in eight Italian subalpine lakes using multiple data sources: historical records, standardised sampling and fishery catch statistics. Thirty-four fish species were recorded, twenty of which are native, seven introduced historically and another seven introduced recently. The number of fish species in individual lakes has increased by between 25 and 65% from 1855 to the present, with the increase being higher in the larger lakes. Non-native species contributed between 4.0 and 71.5% to standardised catches by numbers and between 4.8 and 65.1% by biomass. Roach Rutilus rutilus and pumpkinseed Lepomis gibbosus dominated electrofishing and benthic catches by number, while open-water catches were dominated by the coregonids European whitefish Coregonus lavaretus and gangfish Coregonus macrophthalmus. In terms of biomass, electrofishing catches were dominated by crucian carp Carassius carassius, largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides and wels catfish Silurus glanis, benthic catches were dominated by roach, European whitefish and crucian carp, and open-water catches by coregonids. Commercial fisheries are important ecosystem services provided by subalpine lakes, with their harvests now dominated by non-native species. To deliver effective biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services provision, the prioritisation of targets and interventions of management of non-native species is needed.},

title={Persistence of antibiotic resistance genes in large subalpine lakes: the role of anthropogenic pollution and ecological interactions},
abstract={The spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a threatening risk for human health at a global scale. Improved knowledge on the cycle of antibiotic resistance spread between human and the environment is a major requirement for the management of the current crisis. Compared to the well-studied cycle in clinical settings much less is known about the factor allowing their persistence in the environment. In fact, lakes and rivers exposed to high anthropogenic impact seem to become long-term reservoirs for resistance genes. The presence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) within the resident microbiome of large subalpine lakes (i.e. Lake Geneva, Lake Maggiore) has recently been investigated in both the water column and the sediment. These studies suggest a correlation between the abundance of some ARGs and the anthropogenic impact. Within the system, however, abiotic factors and the food-web structure determine the survival of specific bacterial genotypes and thus the resistance genes they harbour. Thus, a growing body of work suggests an important role of ecological interactions in the persistence or elimination of such genes from the environment. This article reviews the current literature regarding the presence of ARGs in subalpine lakes, the impact of anthropogenic pollution on their appearance and the potential role of various ecological interactions on their persistence in the system.},

We used fish data collected over 5<c2><a0>years for 470 Great Lakes coastal wetlands to develop multi-metric indices of biotic integrity (IBI). Sampling and IBI development were stratified by vegetation type within each wetland to account for differences in physical habitat. Metrics were evaluated against numerous indices of anthropogenic disturbance derived from water quality and surrounding land-cover variables. Separate datasets were used for IBI development and testing. IBIs were composed of 10<e2><80><93>11 metrics for each of four vegetation types (bulrush, cattail, water lily, and submersed aquatic vegetation). Scores of all IBIs correlated well with disturbance indices using the development data, and the accuracy of our IBIs was validated using the testing data. Our fish IBIs can be used to prioritize wetland protection and restoration efforts across the Great Lakes basin. The IBIs will also be useful in monitoring programs mandated by the Agreement between Canada and the United States of America on Great Lakes Water Quality, such as for assessing Beneficial Use Impairments (BUIs) in Great Lakes Areas of Concern, and in other ecosystem management programs in Canada and the USA.},

title={Marine Biosecurity Crisis Decision-Making: Two Tools to Aid â€œGoâ€/â€œNo Goâ€ Decision-Making},
abstract={Determining if a marine species is introduced to an area is an important first step when considering if control or eradication should be attempted. This step is often challenging, especially when data and introduced species expertise is limited: yet decisions about responding to a new invasion needs to occur in a timely manner. The crux is that biosecurity crisis decisions are often made in a vacuum. To improve this process, we outline a rapid response approach that uses a non-probabilistic decision tree to direct decision makers, with additional criteria to determine if a species is native, cryptogenic or introduced. The expanded criteria were derived from patterns within a 10-year dataset of quantitative introduced marine species surveys and is compared against the original Chapman and Carlton 10-point criteria for identifying a species status. Effective use of the rapid response decision-tree and species criteria requires a multi-disciplinary approach drawing upon biology (taxonomy, phylogeny, genetics, ecology, biogeography) and monitoring. The criteria are evaluated against 213 bryozoan species present in Australian waters that were randomly selected from species present in the Australian port surveys and available in the scientific and grey literature. A multivariate evaluation highlighted that a weight of evidence using the expanded criteria approach was successful in determining if a species is introduced or native, and that a number of criteria may be rarely met but when they are met, they provide strong evidence that a species is introduced. The expanded criteria clearly differentiated introduced and cryptogenic species from native species and consequently would reduce mis-classifications of introduced species as native species (Type I error) in comparison to the original criteria. However, differentiating between introduced and cryptogenic species was problematic, especially when using the original criteria. Using both the rapid response decision tree and the criteria provides a quantifiable mechanism to aid decision-makers in deciding whether to respond to a marine species introduction.},

title={Advantages and Limitations of Environmental DNA/RNA Tools for Marine Biosecurity: Management and Surveillance of Non-indigenous Species},
abstract={To enable successful management of marine bioinvasions, timely and robust scientific advice is required. This knowledge should inform managers and stakeholders on the magnitude of a pressure (rate of human-mediated introductions), the environmental state of an ecosystem (impacts of non-indigenous species), and the success of management response (prevention, eradication, mitigation). This advice often relies on baseline biodiversity information in the form of measureable parameters (metrics). This can be derived from conventional approaches such as visual surveys, but also by utilizing environmental DNA/RNA-based molecular techniques, which are increasingly being touted as promising tools for assessing biodiversity and detecting rare or invasive species. Depending on the stage of incursion, each approach has merits and limitations. In this review we assess the performance of biosecurity-relevant biodiversity parameters derived from eDNA/eRNA samples and discuss the results in relation to different stages of invasion and management applications. The overall performance of considered methods ranged between 42 and 75% based on defined criteria, with target-specific approaches scoring higher in general. Caveats are discussed along with avenues which may enhance these techniques and their successful uptake for marine biosecurity surveillance and management. To facilitate and encourage uptake of these techniques, there is a need for an international collaborative framework aimed at unifying molecular sampling and analysis methodologies. Improvement of quantitative capacity and cost-efficiency will also enhance their integration in biosecurity programmes.},

abstract={Invasive species are one of the main threats to biodiversity. When an alien species is introduced into a new environment, fast identification and definition of management strategies may avoid or minimize impacts. When an invasive species is already established, the most adopted approaches are population control and monitoring. In order to perform such strategies, assessment of characteristics of the invasive population is imperative. This study tested a new method of population size estimation and monitoring in an invasive population of crayfish Procambarus clarkii in a conservation area in the Atlantic Rain Forest (Southeastern Brazil). The population dynamics was studied for 1<c2><a0>year to examine the efficacy of the selected method and to evaluate if the population is stable. Later, the effect of periodical removal of animals on the population size was tested. The method of population estimation used in this study proved to be very effective. We recommend using it to monitor invasive populations of P. clarkii. The population size varied discretely over the year with variable but low growth rate, indicating that the population is already established which introduce a notable threat to native species. The continuous removal of specimens proved to be inefficient since the growth rate was higher after the removal. One intensive removal event might be more effective than a continuous moderate removal as the one applied in this study.},

The detection and identification of these organisms in their adult phase in the rivers is not a problem; however, the identification of bivalve larvae by usual morphological methods is difficult due to high similarity conserved in these stages. The use of PCR-RFLP has proven to be an efficient and agile molecular method that allowed the detection of different patterns in the agarose gel for the two bivalves tested. The gel pattern showed a 100 bp band for L. fortunei not detected for C. fluminea. Thus, it is possible to detect larvae of these species from water samples, which can be a powerful tool for environmental monitoring programs on aquatic invasive species.},

However, our results revealed that both flatworm species exhibited type III sigmoidal functional response curves and the smallest predator consistently ingested larger amounts of nematodes. Generally, our results suggest the existence of a strong predator<e2><80><93>prey interaction, given that both flatworms daily ingested a significant proportion of their biomass by feeding only on nematodes (up to 30% for P. tenuis). However, P. torva was unable to process nematodes in sandy sediment, and the ingestion rates of both flatworm species were reduced in a complex litter habitat.},

abstract={Limnoperna fortunei (Dunker 1857) is a freshwater mussel with physiological tolerance to different environmental conditions, which may explain its success as an invasive species. The role of abiotic factors in its establishment, abundance and projections of risk of further spread into several areas has been studied. These mussels may respond to multiple environmental stressors, such as temperature, through physiological mechanisms, behavioral responses, mortality or some combination of these. The aim of this study was to investigate the behavioral responses (valve closing), glycogen concentrations and mortality of L. fortunei under four different temperatures (5<c2><b0>C, 10<c2><b0>C, 20<c2><b0>C and 30<c2><b0>C) during a chronic test (30 days). Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare glycogen concentrations across days of the experiment and at the different temperatures. Differences in valve-closing behavior and mortality among temperatures were tested using repeated-measures ANOVA. We observed that most of the mussels maintained at 5<c2><b0>C closed their valves (74.7<c2><b1>15.3%), indicating that they remain inactive at low temperatures. The glycogen levels significantly differed among the temperatures tested. These differences occurred mainly due to the high glycogen values observed in mussels exposed to 10<c2><b0>C. Stability in glycogen concentrations was observed within each particular temperature. The cumulative mortality was higher at extreme temperatures (5<c2><b0>C and 30<c2><b0>C). The ideal temperature for laboratory maintenance and tests is approximately 20<c2><b0>C. Our data also show that L. fortunei can survive and maintain their energy reserves (glycogen) for several days at 5<c2><b0>C, an important feature related to its invasion success.},

Using a combined ecological and multi-proxy palaeoecological approach we investigated long-term changes in the pathways and processes that underlie eutrophication and water depth effects on lake macrophyte and invertebrate communities across three basins in a shallow lake<e2><80><94>Castle Lough, Northern Ireland, UK. Contemporary data allow us to assess how macrophyte assemblages vary in composition and heterogeneity according to basin-specific factors (e.g. variation in water depth), while palaeoecological data (macrophytes and co-occurring invertebrates) enable us to infer basin-specific impacts and susceptibilities to nutrient-enrichment. Results indicate that variability in water depth promotes assemblage variation amongst the lake basins, stimulating within-lake macrophyte assemblage heterogeneity and hence higher lake biodiversity. The palaeo-data indicate that eutrophication has acted as a strong homogenising agent of macrophyte and invertebrate diversities and abundances over time at the whole-lake scale. This novel finding strongly suggests that, as eutrophication advances, the influence of water depth on community heterogeneity is gradually eroded and that ultimately a limited set of eutrophication-tolerant species will become homogeneously distributed across the entire lake.},

title={The role of mobile consumers in lake nutrient cycles: a brief review},
abstract={We summarise current understanding of consumer recycling in lake nutrient cycles and expand on it by integrating emerging knowledge from food web ecology. The role of consumer nutrient recycling (CNR) is initially framed in the wider context of lake nutrient cycling, which includes hydrodynamic and biogeochemical processes, and their responses to global environmental change. Case studies are used to demonstrate that effects of CNR on lake ecosystems range widely, from reduced nutrient cycling rates to exacerbation of eutrophication. CNR depends on consumer biomass, body size and diet, remaining relatively consistent through the year and becoming important as other fluxes seasonally ebb. Universal patterns in food web structure, for example, consumer<e2><80><93>resource biomass ratios, body size scaling and relationships between trophic level and diet breadth, are used to demonstrate the predictability of CNR effects. Larger, mobile, top predators excrete nutrients at a lower rate but over a wider range, linking nutrient cycles across habitats. Smaller-bodied, lower trophic level consumers have strong localised nutrient cycling effects associated with their limited mobility. Global environmental-change drivers that alter food web structure are likely to have the greatest impact on CNR rates and should direct future studies.},

abstract={As ocean temperatures continue to rise due to climate change, many questions remain on how coastal species will cope with a changing environment. The effects of increased temperatures on bivalves has been well examined through single-species studies, showing reductions in tissue mass, shell growth, oxygen uptake, feeding rates, and survival. However, the consequences of these effects on predator<e2><80><93>prey interactions remain poorly understood. We examined how increased temperatures (30, 32, 34<c2><a0><c2><b0>C) and the presence of water-borne predation cues from blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) affected the morphology and growth rate of southern ribbed mussels (Geukensia granosissima), as well as their handling times when attacked by predatory crabs. Although southern ribbed mussels were able to survive under chronic heat stress, exposure to higher temperatures resulted in more elongated shell shapes. Growth rates in mussel wet weight were higher for mussels reared in the presence of a predator than in the predator-free control, but only in the low-temperature treatment. Likewise, handling times were greater for crabs eating mussels grown in the presence of a predator, but the effect was lost at the mid- and high-temperature treatments. These findings suggest that predation-induced defenses were suppressed when prey were under chronic thermal stress, which could make mussels more vulnerable to predation. The presence of predation cues in natural environments should be taken in consideration when estimating or predicting the effects of climate change on organisms.},

We compared the role of native and non-nativeÂ invasive speciesÂ (NIS) in the food web, between dry and wet periods, and under the influence of an extreme drought period (from 2011 to 2015), simulating the variation in fish biomasses due to decreasing consumption. Key ecosystem groups were fishes (mainly NIS), birds, and insects. Nutrient cycling was dependent on invaders, while the trophic structure was detritus based during the drought. Biomass of detritivores was almost two times higher than herbivores, and native fish species decreased abruptly in response to invaders and volume variation. The dominance of low-trophic levels (TLII) and tilapiaâ€”Oreochromis niloticus (Linnaeus, 1758) and other tilapiinesâ€”resulted from interactions among invaders, feeding behavior on benthos, and environmental seasonality, tending toward biotic homogenization (â€œbenthificationâ€) at the ecosystem level. An increasing relevance of detritivores with cascading effects in ecosystems subject to drought,Â multiple introductions, and ubiquitous food sources has clear implications for the fisheries and theÂ water quality.},

Slimy sculpin in the offshore reduced diet overlap with deepwater sculpin by specializing on fish eggs during spring and fall, whereas in the transitional depth zone, there was considerable overlap between sculpin species due to the high importance of Mysis in diets. The invasive round goby had a mixed diet, with some diet overlap with native sculpin, especially slimy sculpin, in the transitional zone. In the nearshore zone, round goby displayed a generalized diet with many prey contributing to the diet, but the average contribution of any prey was generally low. Spatial separation and variable feeding strategies help reduce, but not eliminate shared resource use amongst these benthic fish in Lake Michigan.},

abstract={The genus Mytilopsis includes some of the most invasive estuarine bivalves in the world, and M. leucophaeata (native to the Gulf of Mexico) and M. sallei (indigenous in the Caribbean Sea) are the most often reported species. Molecular investigations of the COI gene in invasive populations of M. leucophaeata in Europe found only one haplotype, whereas the invasive M. sallei in Asia had high haplotype diversity. The present study investigated COI variability of invasive populations previously identified as M. leucophaeata in Brazil, located at the cities of Recife and Rio de Janeiro. Our genetic analysis revealed that the record of M. leucophaeata from Recife appears erroneous; this population forms a clade adjacent to but genetically separated from the Asian M. cf. sallei. Similarly, samples from Rio de Janeiro clustered close to but not within European/North American sequences of M. leucophaeata. The Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery test suggested the existence of three species: M. leucophaeata, M. cf. sallei (Asia), and M. cf. sallei (Recife), which merit confirmation with nuclear DNA sequences. The discovery of two lineages of Mytilopsis in Brazil augments concerns about their expansion.},

title={The invasive freshwater bivalve <i>Limnoperna fortunei</i> in South America: multiannual changes in its predation and effects on associated benthic invertebrates},
abstract={The invasive golden mussel Limnoperna fortunei is known to strongly affect benthic communities in South American freshwaters, but the evolution of these effects after the early invasion stages is poorly understood. Using predator exclusion (covered with 15- and 40-mm meshes) and inclusion (unprotected) substrates, we investigated the interaction between golden mussels and benthic invertebrate communities at different levels of exposure to predators in the Paran<c3><a1> River delta. Colonization of the substrates was largely dominated by the mussels. Oligochaeta, Nematoda, and Hirudinea were the most abundant accompanying groups, while Rotifera, Tardigrada, Copepoda, Cladocera, Chironomidae, Gastropoda, Hydracarina, Amphipoda, and nauplii appeared sporadically. Regardless of their different trophic modes and functional attributes, the numbers and biomass of associated invertebrates were not only enhanced by protection against predators, but also by the presence of mussel colonies. Enhancement of invertebrate densities associated with mussel colonies was higher on unprotected than protected substrates, suggesting that invertebrate facilitation increases with increasing predation pressure. Comparisons with a similar study carried out a decade earlier suggest that, after two decades of invasion, the reproductive potential of the mussel, the predation pressure on its colonies, and its facilitation effects on other invertebrates have increased in the Paran<c3><a1> River delta.},

We aimed to evaluate the main predictors of peacock basses (Cichla spp.) abundance outside their native range, which are the Amazon and Tocantins-Araguaia river basins. We used multivariate ordination techniques and multimodel inference to analyse peacock basses abundance in twelve reservoirs of the Para<c3><ad>ba do Sul river basin, southeastern Brazil. Interestingly, reservoirs at higher (southernmost) latitudes, located in more populated areas, had higher water temperature and lower turbidity, due to increased water residence time, and these three variables were also positively correlated with abundance of this warm-water invasive fish. Habitat structure was less important in explaining peacock basses abundance, which was not significantly related to biotic factors (fish species richness and time since peacock basses introduction). We hypothesize that the observed effects of reservoir management on limnological features and peacock bass abundance, particularly water residence time (as a mediator of temperature and turbidity), may apply to other Neotropical basins and could influence the impact of this invader.},

title={Phosphorus Dynamics and Availability in the Nearshore of Eastern Lake Erie: Insights From Oxygen Isotope Ratios of Phosphate},
abstract={Blooms of filamentous benthic algae that plagued Lake Erie in the 1950s through 1970s were largely reduced through reductions of phosphorus (P) loading from point sources. Since the mid-1990s, these blooms have returned despite a period of relatively stable external P inputs. While increased loadings of dissolved P have been causally linked to cyanobacterial blooms in some parts of the lake, the impacts of ecosystem changes such as the effect of invasive species on nutrient cycling and availability have not been fully elucidated, leading to uncertainty as to the effectiveness of additional non-point P management actions. Here we use the oxygen isotope ratios (ï¤18OP) of phosphate in concert with measures of water quality along the northern shore of the east basin of Lake Erie to identify sources and pathways of P cycling and infer potential importance in relation to annual blooms of Cladophora that foul the shorelines of eastern Lake Erie. ï¤18OP data indicate that potential external source signatures are rapidly overprinted by biological cycling of P by the plankton community and that much of the available phosphate in the nearshore waters is derived from hydrolysis of dissolved organic P compounds. Near the dreissenid-colonized lake bed, ï¤18OP was persistently and significantly enriched in 18O relative to ï¤18OP measured in surface waters and was similar to ï¤18OP of phosphate excreted by dreissenid mussels in incubations. These results implicate dreissenid mussels as key agents in nearshore P cycling and highlight the importance of considering ecosystem changes in the development of nutrient management strategies designed to ameliorate symptoms of eutrophication.},

abstract={Dredging Austrian Danube harbours becomes necessary to keep the navigation channel free from bed sediment and to insure safe navigation, especially after major floods. In most cases, the excavated substrate is deposited in the free-flowing river section in the vicinity of the mouth of a harbour. The effects of harbour dredging on the biota need to be studied to minimize possible outcomes that may endanger the ecological status of the river system in order to implement the aims of the European Water Framework Directive. This study presents the first quantitative information on the colonisation of benthic invertebrates with respect to Danube harbours. One sampling at Linz Harbour was conducted before dredging and four samplings were carried out after dredging. Four transects were documented in the affected river section. The study used an air-lift sampler and a grab sampler to investigate if and to what extent the benthic invertebrate community is disturbed. It found that the sediment dredging heavily affected the benthic invertebrates (decline of 82% of biomass), while the dumping of the material had no effects on the benthic Danube biota. As a rough estimate (conferring to a simple trend line analysis) the harbour bottom fauna would recover after 235<c2><a0>days.},

abstract={Biological invasions threaten biodiversity in terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems, requiring substantial conservation and management efforts. To examine how the conservation planning literature addresses biological invasions and if planning in the marine environment could benefit from experiences in the freshwater and terrestrial systems, we conducted a global systematic review. Out of 1149 scientific articles mentioning both <e2><80><98>conservation planning<e2><80><99> and <e2><80><98>alien<e2><80><99> or any of its alternative terms, 70 articles met our selection criteria. Most of the studies were related to the terrestrial environment, while only 10% focused on the marine one. The main conservation targets were species (mostly vertebrates) rather than habitats or ecosystems. Apart from being mentioned, alien species were considered of concern for conservation in only 46% of the cases, while mitigation measures were proposed in only 13% of the cases. The vast majority of the studies (73%) ignored alien species in conservation planning even if their negative impacts were recognized. In 20% of the studies, highly invaded areas were avoided in the planning, while in 6% of the cases such areas were prioritized for conservation. In the latter case, two opposing approaches led to the selection of invaded areas: either alien and native biodiversity were treated equally in setting conservation targets, i.e. alien species were also considered as ecological features requiring protection, or more commonly invaded sites were prioritized for the implementation of management actions to control or eradicate invasive alien species. When the <e2><80><98>avoid<e2><80><99> approach was followed, in most of the cases highly impacted areas were either excluded or invasive alien species were included in the estimation of a cost function to be minimized. Most of the studies that followed a <e2><80><98>protect<e2><80><99> or <e2><80><98>avoid<e2><80><99> approach dealt with terrestrial or freshwater features but in most cases the followed approach could be transferred to the marine environment.

title={Are Changes in Lower Trophic Levels Limiting Prey-Fish Biomass and Production in Lake Michigan?},
abstract={To improve understanding of how recent changes in lower trophic levels in Lake Michigan could be affecting prey-fish biomass and production, the Lake Michigan Committee (LMC) convened a Lower Trophic Level Task Group and provided several charges that are responded to in this report. First, we compiled a comprehensive summary of lower trophic-level data in Lake Michigan, separating out nearshore versus offshore trends over time. Declining trends were prevalent in offshore time series for phosphorus, chlorophyll a, biomass of total crustacean zooplankton, biomass of herbivorous cladocerans, and density of Diporeia spp. In the nearshore, declining trends were evident only for biomass of cyclopoid copepods and density of Diporeia spp. Second, we hypothesized specific mechanisms by which changes in lower trophic levels could affect prey-fish biomass and production and described the degree of empirical support for each mechanism. The best-supported hypothesis was that declining invertebrate prey (especially Diporeia spp.) was responsible for declining growth of prey fish, especially over the last decade when competition for prey resources should otherwise have been lessened due to declining prey-fish densities. As a result, declining growth potentially limits the prey-fish biomass that could have been attained had growth been maintained at the levels that were achieved in the 1980s and earlier. Third, we prioritized several lower trophic-level indicators that fishery managers could use to better inform decision making. The top-ranked indicator was annual reporting of Alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) condition. Fourth, we prioritized the key monitoring and research gaps that limit our current understanding of how lower trophic levels influence fish production. The highest-priority monitoring gap was coordinated sampling of the nearshore, which, if accomplished, would complement annual reporting on offshore sampling. The top-ranked knowledge gap was identifying bottlenecks that regulate fish recruitment, given that recent changes in zooplankton distribution and abundance could be suppressing survival of larval fish and, ultimately, the biomass and production of prey fish. We provided three specific recommendations for the LMC to consider as they seek to better incorporate lower trophic-level changes into their management decision process: (1) implement a coordinated and standardized nearshore monitoring program, (2) encourage funding agencies to use our prioritized lists in their decision processes, and (3) foster the already improved dialogue between those researching lower trophic levels and those researching fisheries.},

abstract={The article presents the results of comprehensive research of the fish fauna of the cooling pond of the Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Plant. The species composition of the fish fauna and the main limiting factors affecting the structure of the ichthyocenosis of the reservoir have been studied. It is noted that the fish fauna is dominated by invasive species (57%), most of which are introduced for the biological melioration in a cooling pond. The decrease in the number of native fish species is caused both by the spread of invasive species and by the factor of high water temperature. The latter factor limits the number of fish species that do not tolerate a rise in water temperature (roach Rutilus rutilus (Linnaeus, 1758), bream Abramis brama (Linnaeus, 1758), rudd Scardinius erythrophthalmus (Linnaeus, 1758)). The paper also presents the results of studies on the nutrition spectrum of fish living in the Zaporizhia NPP cooling pond.

abstract={Mussels of the family Mytilidae are known for the two commercial important species in Europe, Mytilus edulis (Linneaus, 1758) (blue mussel) and Mytilus galloprovincialis (Lamarck, 1819) (Mediterranean mussel). To guarantee adequate production and quality in aquaculture general condition of the stock is routinely monitored, either by shell growth rate, soft body weight or condition index (CI). This study tested over 218 days (about 8 months) the starvation capability of blue mussels from the Baltic Sea, a low salinity environment, under fully controlled conditions. Because these mussels, genetically, represent two different species, M. edulis and M. trossulus (Gould, 1850), we examined a combination of both, as common in the western Baltic Sea. During experimental time the water temperature was kept at 15<c2><b0>C (<c2><b1>1<c2><b0>C) and 15 PSU (<c2><b1>1 PSU). Test animals physiology was verified by standard procedures, e.g. by CI, shell length growth rate and flesh water content. M. edulis-like mussel starvation capacity was high, 93 of 100 tested animals survived the entire 8 months. The CI decreased from initial 20.0 to 5.2 (loss of 74%) as well as the soft body weight retrospectively from initial 1.95 to 0.54 g (loss of 72%). The water content of the soft body increased from initial 95% to 98.4%. Regarding the total length of the mussels a decrease was found which ranged between the initial stocking sizes of the mussels (3.28 cm (<c2><b1>0.58 cm). We herewith demonstrate first results of the correlation of decreasing general condition, determined by CI and flesh weight, and an increase of flesh water content of blue mussels.},

abstract={Among environmental contaminants, heavy metals are currently considered to be some of the most toxic ones present worldwide due to their harmful effects on organisms and ability to bioaccumulate in aquatic systems. In this work, the concentration of heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn, Ni and Cr) in Brachidontes rodriguezii and in the fine sediments of several coastal sites at the southwest of Buenos Aires Province, Argentina is analyzed. The BahÃ­a Blanca Estuary and Pehuen-CÃ³ beach are located in a highly complex oceanographic and ecological regional system, which creates the basis of one of the most valuable Argentinean habitats for fishing commercial species. An assessment, which involved analyzing distribution pattern of trace metals, comparative studies with sediment and ecological quality guidelines; and a sequential and integrated index analyses approach (containing Metal Pollution Index, Biosediment Accumulation Factor, Geo-accumulation Index (Igeo), Pollution Load Index and the mean Probable Effect Level quotients), was followed to estimate enrichment and risks of heavy metals in the sediments and in the mussels from these study areas. The results showed higher concentrations of some heavy metals (e.g., Cd, Cr and Ni) in mussels collected at Pehuen-CÃ³, while no spatial differences in sediments were observed. According to the international environmental regulations, mean values of trace metals in mussels allowed to place both sites between â€œunpolluted and moderately pollutedâ€ and between the â€œlow and medium categoryâ€ of pollution. Furthermore, the mean concentrations found were within the detected ranges in other coastal sites worldwide.},

abstract={Mayflies (Order Ephemeroptera) require high quality water and habitat in streams to thrive, so their appearance after restoration is an indicator of ecological recovery. To better understand the importance of restoring in-stream habitat versus water chemistry for macroinvertebrate communities, we developed taxon-specific models of occurrence for five mayfly genera (Caenis, Isonychia, Stenonema, Stenacron, and Baetis) inhabiting streams in the Appalachian Mountains, USA. Presence/absence records from past decades were used to develop single and multiple logistic predictive models based on catchment characteristics (drainage area, gradient), in-stream habitat variables (e.g., substrate, channel morphology, pool and riffle quality), and water chemistry. Model performance was evaluated using (a) classification rates and Hosmer-Lemeshow values for test sets of data withheld from the original model-building dataset and (b) a field comparison of predicted versus observed mayfly occurrences at 53 sites in acid mine drainage-impaired watersheds in 2012. The classification accuracies of final models for Caenis, Stenacron, and Baetis ranged from 50 to 75%. In-stream habitat features were not significant predictor variables for these three taxa, only water chemistry. Models for Isonychia and Stenonema had higher classification rates (81%) and included both habitat and chemical variables. However, actual occurrences of Isonychia and Stenonema at study sites in 2012 were low, consistent with the calculated probability of occurrence (Po)<e2><80><89><<e2><80><89>0.60. Caenis occurred at test sites 35% of the time when the model predicted a Po<e2><80><89>><e2><80><89>0.40.

Predator-induced mortality of the clams was low in summer, and very high in the winter<e2><80><93>spring period. It was inversely proportional to the size of the clams. Such changes can be partially attributed to predation from at least five fish and three duck species, which contained clams in their digestive tracts. Non-predatory mortality particularly affected large individuals, and was highest in spring, several weeks after the end of winter. We hypothesize that it could be caused by persistent low temperatures over several winter months which led to considerable weakening of the condition of clams. A long winter could also reduce their resistance to environmental stress and potential effect of epibionts, as well as increase susceptibility to predation.},

abstract={Human activity has dramatically accelerated both species extinctions and introductions, and the balance of these two processes is generally expected to reduce biodiversity and increase taxonomic homogenization. However, few tests of this hypothesis have been made. We tested whether new macroinvertebrate invaders in North American freshwaters can replace the recent loss of biodiversity, particularly focusing on molluscs. We found that both crustaceans and molluscs are overrepresented among endangered and recently extinct species, as well as among invaders. For molluscs, the number of recently extinct species (79 species) was more than twice that for exotic species (38 species). In addition, molluscan invaders are from different taxonomic families than recently extinct or endangered species. While most extinct and endangered molluscs are from streams and rivers, invaders preferentially colonize lakes and reservoirs. The impact of humans on species introductions and extinctions increases with spatial scale (from local to continental scales), resulting in the increased phylogenetic dissimilarity between introduced species and native communities. Construction of dams and alteration of the flow regimes of lotic systems will continue to lead to the extinction of native species, and promote the spread of invaders, resulting in a loss of biodiversity and taxonomic homogenization.},

Soft tissues from different Corbicula populations, plus soft tissues from a native clam, tuna and Corbicula shell powder were offered to consumers. Field assays were performed seasonally and laboratory assays only in summer; both assays also tested possible differences during distinct periods of the day. Overall, in natural conditions, the treatments containing C. fluminea had a low palatability. In laboratory assays, higher consumption (almost two times) was observed for Cyprinus carpio and Anguilla anguilla. Also, C. fluminea palatability was different between populations, with the treatment Corbicula Lima being more consumed than Corbicula Minho. Despite the low values of consumption in the field, laboratory results suggest that C. fluminea soft tissues can be a food resource to some species.},

Growth, physiological condition, and the locomotor activity were assessed in U. delphinus at increasing C. fluminea density. U. delphinus exhibited lower growth, lower physiological condition, and higher locomotor activity at higher C. fluminea density, which may suggest that this unionid is negatively affected by C. fluminea and may be displaced to less favorable habitats. Although we were not able to establish the main mechanism(s) responsible for these results, possibilities include competition for food resources, competition for space which may result in mussel displacements and/or changes in microhabitat features as a result of bioturbation activities, and production of feces and pseudofeces by C. fluminea.},

abstract={Ecosystem services are the benefits that humans derive from ecosystems. Freshwater mussels perform many important functions in aquatic ecosystems, which can in turn be framed as the ecosystem services that they contribute to or provide. These include supporting services such as nutrient recycling and storage, structural habitat, substrate and food web modification, and use as environmental monitors; regulating services such as water purification (biofiltration); and provisioning and cultural services including use as a food source, as tools and jewelry, and for spiritual enhancement. Mussel-provided ecosystem services are declining because of large declines in mussel abundance. Mussel propagation could be used to restore populations of common mussel species and their ecosystem services. We need much more quantification of the economic, social, and ecological value and magnitude of ecosystem services provided by mussels, across species, habitats, and environmental conditions, and scaled up to whole watersheds. In addition, we need tools that will allow us to value mussel ecosystem services in a way that is understandable to both the public and to policy makers.},

title={Conservation of freshwater bivalves at the global scale:Â diversity, threats and research needs},
abstract={Bivalves are ubiquitous members of freshwater ecosystems and responsible for important functions and services. The present paper revises freshwater bivalve diversity, conservation status and threats at the global scale and discusses future research needs and management actions. The diversity patterns are uneven across the globe with hotspots in the interior basin in the United States of America (USA), Central America, Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. Freshwater bivalves are affected by multiple threats that vary across the globe; however, pollution and natural system (habitat) modifications being consistently found as the most impacting. Freshwater bivalves are among the most threatened groups in the world with 40% of the species being near threatened, threatened or extinct, and among them the order Unionida is the most endangered. We suggest that global cooperation between scientists, managers, politicians and general public, and application of new technologies (new generation sequencing and remote sensing, among others) will strengthen the quality of studies on the natural history and conservation of freshwater bivalves. Finally, we introduce the articles published in this special issue of Hydrobiologia under the scope of the Second International Meeting on Biology and Conservation of Freshwater Bivalves held in 2015 in Buffalo, New York, USA.},

abstract={The critically endangered Giant Freshwater Pearl Mussel Margaritifera auricularia was presumed extinct before its rediscovery in Spain in 1985 and France in 2000. Since then, numerous surveys have been set up to search for living populations in France and Spain. This article presents an up-to-date account of species distribution based on available data, i.e. the literature, museum collections and recent field surveys, and provides unpublished molecular data for France. There are still three populations of the Giant Freshwater Pearl Mussel in the Ebro River in Spain, and eight populations in France (two in the Loire watershed, one in the Charente watershed, two in the Garonne watershed and three in the Adour watershed). The biggest population lives in the Charente River with an estimated 100,000 individuals. Recruitment is very scarce in all populations but living specimens estimated to be less than 10<c2><a0>years old have been found in the Ebro in Spain and in the Vienne, Charente, Dronne and Adour rivers in France. The recent rediscovery of populations in France was mainly a result of intensive dedicated surveys including scuba diving. Subsequent advances in knowledge show how large rivers and downstream ecosystems remain a terra incognita for the hydrobiologist.},

title={Influence of environmental factors and biogenic habitats on intertidal meiofauna},
abstract={This study investigated the influence of physical and chemical conditions and biotic factors on the distribution and diversity of meiofauna in intertidal zone along a geographical gradient. At 11 sites along the Italian coast, we studied the concurring role of environmental variables, trophic resources and the presence of habitat-forming species (macroalgae vs. mussels) in controlling the meiofaunal communities. The increase of water temperature combined with local thermal conditions was associated with a decrease in nematodes and copepods, with a consequent decrease in meiofaunal abundance towards the south. However, the increase in salinity, as geographical gradient decreases, and local thermal conditions favoured the settlement of a greater number of taxa, influencing communities<e2><80><99> composition. The presence of macroalgae or mussels differently influenced the community structure of meiofauna on intertidal substrates and their response to environmental factors. From our results, the presence of macroalgae coverage appeared to reduce the impact of thermal stress on meiofauna and was associated with higher levels of meiofaunal diversity with respect to mussels. This work highlighted the importance of considering the interplay among biotic and abiotic factors, resulting in local combinations of environmental conditions, in order to understand the pattern of diversity and distributions of marine organisms.},

title={Influences on Water Quality and Abundance of <i>Cladophora</i>, a Shore-Fouling Green Algae, over Urban Shoreline in Lake Ontario},
abstract={Urban centers border western Lake Ontario, the terminus of the Laurentian Great Lakes, impacting water quality on the shores of this oligotrophic lake. The green algae Cladophora proliferates on the shallow lakebed and fouls the shoreline, presenting an eutrophication concern. The conditions over a typical urbanized shoreline were studied to assess linkages between Cladophora and area nutrient sources. The most pervasive of the mixing areas of varying extent identified using field sensor measurements was associated with the discharge of treated sewage from a Water Pollution Control Plant (WPCP). Phosphorus and nitrogen were enriched at times near the WPCP diffuser and also in shallow water along the shoreline. Dissolved nutrients were also measured directly above the lakebed in close proximity to Cladophora. Dissolved phosphorus and inorganic nitrogen were higher in proximity to the WPCP diffuser at times, however, spatial patterns were not as clearly aligned with external inputs as the patterns of enrichment in the water column. Biomass distribution of Cladophora was unrelated to nutrient levels in the water column or at the lakebed. Yet, concentrations of phosphorus in Cladophora, an indicator of nutrient sufficiency, were higher near the WPCP diffuser. This disparity, while possibly an artifact of variable loss rates of biomass among locations, may in part stem from variable water clarity among areas. Abundant dreissenid mussels also potentially obscure the effects of nutrient loading on algal biomass if the sequestering of phosphorus from offshore plankton, suggested by periods of onshore circulation, approaches the extent of external loading. Further study of phosphorus flux at the lakebed is required to establish clear linkages between external nutrient loading and algal growth in order to manage the proliferation of Cladophora over urban coastline.},

Here we investigated what settlement cues might be important for mytilid populations in southeastern Brazil. Our results point to a trophic trigger mediating larval settlement that may include an effect of saturated fatty acids, probably linked to organic detritus and bacterial production deriving from terrestrial inputs. The prevalence of drifting in this population suggests it may be a strategy for individuals to delay final settlement until encountering favorable trophic environmental conditions.},

abstract={The influence of vertical environmental gradients on zooplankton communities was studied in five humic lakes with the high availability of food resources (phytoplankton and bacterioplankton) and low fish pressure. The factors that inhibit the development of large zooplankton in humic lakes are currently widely debated. We have found that relatively productive humic lakes do not offer many niches for zooplankton because of the sharp thermal gradient which results in a shallow layer of oxygenated waters. The results of this study indicated that different taxonomic groups of zooplankton are determined by a different set of environmental variables. This phenomenon explains very low species richness of zooplankton and a possibility of their coexistence in the narrow oxygenated layer. We concluded that due to sharp thermal gradient in humic lakes biomass of herbivores may be reduced which could promote development of phytoplankton.},

abstract={Marine biodiversity and ecosystem functioning <e2><80><93> including seaweed communities <e2><80><93> in the territorial waters of the UK and its Overseas Territories are facing unprecedented pressures. Key stressors are changes in ecosystem functioning due to biodiversity loss caused by ocean warming (species replacement and migration, e.g. affecting kelp forests), sea level rise (e.g. loss of habitats including salt marshes), plastic pollution (e.g. entanglement and ingestion), alien species with increasing numbers of alien seaweeds (e.g. outcompeting native species and parasite transmission), overexploitation (e.g. loss of energy supply further up the food web), habitat destruction (e.g. loss of nursery areas for commercially important species) and ocean acidification (e.g. skeletal weakening of ecosystem engineers including coralline algal beds). These stressors are currently affecting biodiversity, and their impact can be projected for the future. All stressors may act alone or in synergy. Marine biodiversity provides crucial goods and services. Climate change and biodiversity loss pose new challenges for legislation. In particular, there are implications of climate change for the designation and management of Marine Protected Areas and natural carbon storage by marine systems to help control the global climate system. The UK currently has legal obligations to protect biodiversity under international and European law.},

title={CAN THE INVASIVE NEW ZEALAND MUD SNAIL (POTAMOPYRGUS ANTIPODARUM) THREATEN FISHERIES OF TEMPERATE LAKES? A CASE STUDY FROM LAKE DUSIA, LITHUANIA},
abstract={To date, numerous studies of the impact of snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum (Gray, 1843) on invaded ecosystems have been conducted. However, the majority of such studies intended to assess changes induced in macroinvertebrate assemblages, while the possible effects of P. antipodarum on higher trophic levels have not hitherto been studied. Of particular interest from the point of view of fisheries management is the elucidation of how this invasive snail can alter the energy flow towards higher trophic levels. When abundant, P. antipodarum consumes a substantial part of the primary production, but it is poorly consumed by native fishes. Consequently, part of its assimilated energy may become locked in lower trophic levels and fail to reach higher levels directly. Therefore, invasion of this snail may decrease fish production. Several years after establishment of P. antipodarum in a temperate mesotrophic Lake Dusia, we assessed: (1) changes in the biomass of littoral macroinvertebrates (proxy to secondary production), (2) assimilation of P. antipodarum by benthivorous fish (energy flow), and (3) changes in growth and catches of littoral benthivorous fish (fish production). All the analyses were based on a merger of "grey" literature and original data during the pre- and post-invasion periods. There was an evident increase in the biomass of littoral macroinvertebrates, and the assemblage changed from crustacean- to gastropod-dominated due to over-domination of P. antipodarum. However, P. antipodarum did not replace the native prey of fish. Moreover, a marked decrease was recorded in littoral fish growth and catches after the invasion of P. antipodarum. Dense populations of P. antipodarum may reduce the channelling of primary production towards higher trophic levels and, consequently, the invasion may threaten fisheries of temperate mesotrophic lakes.},

title={Biological consequences of weak acidification caused by elevated carbon dioxide in freshwater ecosystems},
abstract={Weak acidification can occur in freshwater ecosystems when free carbon dioxide (CO2) levels increase, which can happen for a variety of reasons. To define the state of knowledge for how weak acidification influences freshwater biota and ecosystems, a review of the primary literature was conducted. Despite few empirical studies focused on weak acidification in the primary literature (~100 studies), some themes have emerged from our literature review. Most studies focused on physiological responses at the organismal level, and fish were the most studied taxa. Animals exhibited reduced individual growth rates, and, in contrast, primary producers demonstrated increased individual and population growth rates. In animals, mortality, sub-lethal injuries, and changes to behaviours were also observed. Negative consequences to reproduction in macrophytes were found. Few studies have focused on population, community, or ecosystem levels, though broad scale studies suggest that weak acidification can limit species community diversity, specifically in invertebrates and fish. Moving forward, researchers need to continue to advance our understanding of the consequences of weak acidification for freshwater biota. Furthermore, priority should be placed on research that can evaluate the potential for weak acidification in freshwater to lead to changes in ecological regimes or economical outcomes, such as fisheries collapses.},

title={Aquatic biodiversity in forests: a weak link in ecosystem services resilience},
abstract={The diversity of aquatic ecosystems is being quickly reduced on many continents, warranting a closer examination of the consequences for ecological integrity and ecosystem services. Here we describe intermediate and final ecosystem services derived from aquatic biodiversity in forests. We include a summary of the factors framing the assembly of aquatic biodiversity in forests in natural systems and how they change with a variety of natural disturbances and human-derived stressors. We consider forested aquatic ecosystems as a multi-state portfolio, with diverse assemblages and life-history strategies occurring at local scales as a consequence of a mosaic of habitat conditions and past disturbances and stressors. Maintaining this multi-state portfolio of assemblages requires a broad perspective of ecosystem structure, various functions, services, and management implications relative to contemporary stressors. Because aquatic biodiversity provides multiple ecosystem services to forests, activities that compromise aquatic ecosystems and biodiversity could be an issue for maintaining forest ecosystem integrity. We illustrate these concepts with examples of aquatic biodiversity and ecosystem services in forests of northwestern North America, also known as Northeast Pacific Rim. Encouraging management planning at broad as well as local spatial scales to recognize multi-state ecosystem management goals has promise for maintaining valuable ecosystem services. Ultimately, integration of information from socio-ecological ecosystems will be needed to maintain ecosystem services derived directly and indirectly from forest aquatic biota.},

abstract={Freshwater mussels of the order Unionida have been dramatically declining globally. Despite their ecological importance, conservation of these animals has been hindered by unresolved taxonomy and a lack of data on the distribution and status of populations, especially in southern Europe. Although the Italian Peninsula has been noted as a centre of endemism and one of the major refugia of the glacial ages for several taxa, few studies have been performed on the genetic diversity of Unionida. Most importantly, the taxonomic status of several freshwater mussel populations of the Italian Peninsula is still unresolved. Here we present the first comprehensive dataset for the Unionida of the region spanning Italy and the coastal Croatian region (west of the Dinaric Alps). In total, 191 specimens were collected (85 Anodonta, 64 Unio, 17 Microcondylaea bonellii and 25 Sinanodonta woodiana) from 34 sites across the Italian Peninsula and coastal Croatian river basins for molecular identification (COI, 16S and 28S). Genetic analyses were performed to understand major phylogenetic and phylogeographic patterns. Seven species were detected: three Anodonta species (A. anatina, A. cygnea and A. exulcerata), two Unio species (U. mancus and U. elongatulus), Microcondylaea bonellii, and the invasive Sinanodonta woodiana. The presence of three endemic species (A. exulcerata, U. elongatulus and M. bonellii) confirms the importance of the region as a centre of endemism for freshwater mussels.

title={Using a gradient in food quality to infer drivers of fatty acid content in two filter-feeding aquatic consumers},
abstract={Inferences about ecological structure and function are often made using elemental or macromolecular tracers of food web structure. For example, inferences about food chain length are often made using stable isotope ratios of top predators and consumer food sources are often inferred from both stable isotopes and fatty acid (FA) content in consumer tissues. The use of FAs as tracers implies some degree of macromolecular conservation across trophic interactions, but many FAs are subject to physiological alteration and animals may produce those FAs from precursors in response to food deficiencies. We measured 41 individual FAs and several aggregate FA metrics in two filter-feeding taxa to (1) assess ecological variation in food availability and (2) identify potential drivers of among-site variation in FA content. These taxa were filter feeding caddisflies (Family Hydropyschidae) and dreissenid mussels (Genus Dreissena), which both consume seston. Stable isotopic composition (C and N) in these taxa co-varied across 13 sites in the Great Lakes region of North America, indicating they fed on very similar food resources. However, co-variation in FA content was very limited, with only one common FA co-varying across this gradient (<ce><b1>-linolenic acid; ALA), suggesting these taxa accumulate FAs very differently even when exposed to the same foods. Based on these results, among-site variation in ALA content in both consumers does appear to be driven by food resources, along with several other FAs in dreissenid mussels. We conclude that single-taxa measurements of FA content cannot be used to infer FA availability in food resources.},

During 2014<e2><80><93>15, individuals were captured using trot-lines in a 13-km reach that supports the greatest density of lake sturgeon. We used colonic flushing and gastric lavage techniques to obtain diet. We took systematic benthic sediment grabs along multiple transects throughout the reach and opportunistically deployed rock cages filled with hard substrates to assess potential prey that colonize hard surfaces. Foraging modes of lake sturgeon were determined by comparing relative abundances of invertebrate taxa in the gut contents (6581 invertebrates) of 28 fish to the relative abundances of the same invertebrate taxa collected from the resource base (1667 invertebrates). Proportional similarity, Levin<e2><80><99>s niche breadth, and Manly<e2><80><99>s index were used to assess the degree of prey selectivity. Lake sturgeon fed selectively on a narrow range of available prey consisting mostly of larval chironomids (93% composition by number during warm season, 96% during cool season), some genera of which they prey upon selectively, primarily Chironomus sp., but to a lesser extent Procladius, Ablabesmyia, Coelotanypus, and Cryptochironomus spp. Meanwhile, other abundant taxa in the resource base were avoided, such as Oligochaetes, Hexagenia mayflies, and the chironomid Glyptotendipes. Our results illustrate that assessing seasonally available prey from habitat utilized by lake sturgeon is important when investigating diet preference.},

abstract={Planktivorous Silver Carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix and Bighead Carp H. nobilis have successfully invaded much of the Upper Mississippi River System and its tributaries during the last 30<c2><a0>years. During the initial years of the invasion, concurrent declines in the body condition and the catch per unit effort (CPUE) of planktivorous Gizzard Shad Dorosoma cepedianum and Bigmouth Buffalo Ictiobus cyprinellus were attributed to competition with Asian carp. Using an additional seven years of data (2007<e2><80><93>2013), we assessed whether Silver Carp have continued to exert adverse pressure on the condition, CPUE, and biomass of native planktivores or whether there is evidence of a potential rebound in the populations of native planktivores. The extended data set reaffirms the body condition and the CPUE of Bigmouth Buffalo remain significantly reduced. However, unlike previous analyses, we also observed significant reductions in the CPUE of Gizzard Shad. Additionally, new results show that the CPUE and biomass of Bigmouth Buffalo were more inversely related to Silver Carp CPUE and biomass relative to the CPUE and biomass of Gizzard Shad. These results reinforce that Silver Carp likely suppress native planktivores and also suggest that diet and other life-history traits may explain some of the subtle differences in species-specific responses. Our results also emphasize that long-term data can be critical to understanding how non-native species can influence native fish population dynamics and how this influence may change over time.},

title={Predicting predatory impact of juvenile invasive lionfish (Pterois volitans) on a crustacean prey using functional response analysis: effects of temperature, habitat complexity and light regimes},
abstract={The ecological implications of biotic interactions, such as predator-prey relationships, are often context-dependent. Comparative functional responses analysis can be used under different abiotic contexts to improve understanding and prediction of the ecological impact of invasive species. Pterois volitans (Lionfish) [Linnaeus 1758] is an established invasive species in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, with a more recent invasion into the Mediterranean. Lionfish are generalist predators that impact a wide range of commercial and non-commercial species. Functional response analysis was employed to quantify interaction strength between lionfish and a generic prey species, the shrimp (Palaemonetes varians) [Leach 1814], under the contexts of differing temperature, habitat complexity and light wavelength. Lionfish have prey population destabilising Type II functional responses under all contexts examined. Significantly more prey were consumed at 26<c2><a0><c2><b0>C than at 22<c2><a0><c2><b0>C. Habitat complexity did not significantly alter the functional response parameters. Significantly more prey were consumed under white light and blue light than under red light. Attack rate was significantly higher under white light than under blue or red light. Light wavelength did not significantly change handling times. The impacts on prey populations through feeding rates may increase with concomitant temperature increase. As attack rates are very high at low habitat complexity this may elucidate the cause of high impact upon degraded reef ecosystems with low-density prey populations, although there was little protection conferred through habitat complexity. Only red light (i.e. dark) afforded any reduction in predation pressure. Management initiatives should account for these environmental factors when planning mitigation and prevention strategies.},

title={Contributions of freshwater mussels (Unionidae) to nutrient cycling in an urban river: filtration, recycling, storage, and removal},
abstract={Consumers contribute to nutrient cycling in aquatic ecosystems by nutrient retention in tissues, metabolic transformations and excretion, and promoting microbial processes that remove nutrients (i.e., nitrogen (N) loss via denitrification). Freshwater mussels (Unionidae) form dense assemblages in rivers, and affect nutrient transformations through feeding, biodeposition, and bioturbation. However, the effects of Unionid mussels on N and phosphorus (P) retention are not commonly measured. We quantified rates of filtration, retention, and biodeposition of carbon (C), N, and P for two Unionid species: Lasmigona complanata and Pyganodon grandis. We used continuous-flow cores with 15N tracers to measure denitrification in sediments alone and with a single individual of each species. We conducted measurements in an urban river near Chicago, IL, USA that is a target for Unionid restoration. Both Unionid species showed high rates of P-specific feeding and retention, but low N-specific rates. This was in agreement with high N:P ratio in the water column. Each species significantly increased denitrification relative to sediment alone. 15N tracers suggested direct denitrification of nitrate increased denitrification, although enhanced coupled nitrification<e2><80><93>denitrification likely also contributed to denitrification. Finally, denitrification rates with and without mussels were used to estimate the value of N loss under different scenarios for mussel restoration at the river scale. Overall, restored Unionid populations may enhance P retention in soft tissues and shells and N loss via denitrification. Ecosystem managers may find greater support for restoration of Unionid populations with careful calculations of their ecosystem role in nutrient retention and removal.},

title={Associations between food habits and pharyngeal morphology in the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus)},
abstract={Several studies have shown that round gobies (Neogobius melanostomus) undergo a dietary shift from arthropods to dreissenid mussels as they grow, and this shift is accompanied by changes in pharyngeal morphology associated with durophagy. In contrast, some populations of round gobies prey heavily on various arthropods, but it is unknown whether those populations develop pharyngeal morphology associated with durophagy or if they develop less robust and molarized structures. To test if there is a relationship between food habits and pharyngeal morphology, we compared those characters in round gobies from two sites in Erie Co., Pennsylvania: a dreissenid-present site (Presque Isle Bay, PIB, of Lake Erie) and a dreissenid-absent site (Fairview Gravel Pit, GP). Multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) revealed consistent ontogenetic changes at both sites in which lower pharyngeals of larger fish were more robust, possessed wider teeth, and had a greater area taken up by large diameter teeth. Pharyngeal morphology also differed between sites, with gobies from PIB having wider and more robust lower pharyngeals. Food habits differed markedly between round gobies from the two sites, with dreissenid mussels being the most important prey item for all length classes in PIB, and crustaceans being the most important prey item for all length classes at the GP. Canonical correlation analysis on all round gobies revealed a correlation between consumption of dreissenid prey and pharyngeal characters associated with durophagy. Although food habits and pharyngeal morphology of round gobies appear to be associated, the mechanism responsible for the association (i.e. phenotypic plasticity versus local adaptation) is not clear.},

title={Abiotic factors affecting habitat selection by two invasive gammarids Dikerogammarus villosus and Pontogammarus robustoides},
abstract={Identification of habitat preferences of invasive organisms is crucial for predicting their distribution and impact. We conducted laboratory experiments to determine preferences of Dikerogammarus villosus and Pontogammarus robustoides, invasive in Europe, with regard to ionic content (450 and 830 [mu]S/cm in a Y-maze), flow (0-30 cm/s in a flow-through tank with stagnant water refuges) and temperature (a gradient 5-35<c2><b0>C). D. villosus selected the lower salinity, whereas P. robustoides did not discriminate between salinities, suggesting that, the raised ionic content in large European rivers cannot explain their absence in small tributaries, as previously postulated. Gammarids never preferred flowing over stagnant water, but could stay in a flow [less than or equal to]10 cm/s without behavioural changes. They avoided flow [greater than or equal to]15 cm/s. Gammarids selected warmer water than their acclimation temperatures. Temperature selection by D. villosus was related to its acclimation temperature. The choice of P. robustoides depended on the season: it preferred a lower temperature in summer than in autumn. Therefore, its thermal preferences were more stable throughout the year, which might be advantageous in shallow, thermally variable areas. Gammarids used environmental variables to select warm, lentic, freshwater locations, which may help them locate an optimum microhabitat and thrive in temporally and spatially variable environments.},

abstract={Global environmental changes constitute major threats to biodiversity in all ecosystems worldwide. Here we experimentally examined how temperature and trophic condition can influence the interaction between a highly invasive species and a native naiad species. We exposed the native freshwater mussel Unio delphinus to the presence/absence of the invasive Corbicula fluminea under three temperature levels and three trophic conditions. We used linear mixed models and hierarchical partitioning to model and test the independent effects of each variable in explaining U. delphinus feces production, which was used as a proxy for nutrient enrichment. Unio delphinus responded to high temperatures with higher clearance and respiration rates, showing an increase in energy expenditure. Feces production varied significantly with each factor and there was an interactive effect between the factors; increasing with temperature and trophic condition, and declining in the presence of the invasive clam. The hierarchical partitioning model showed that the system trophic condition and C. fluminea were the most important factors explaining feces production and to a lesser extent water temperature. Depletion of energetic reserves to cope with increasing temperatures could compromise the tolerance to additional stressors such as competition with invasive species or food reduction.},

title={LONG-TERM CHANGES IN FISH COMMUNITY STRUCTURE REVEALED BY GILLNET MONITORING IN A SHALLOW, LOWLAND RESERVOIR},
abstract={Fish communities can support or hinder water quality management. SulejÃ³w Reservoir, which is situated on the Pilica River in Central Poland, serves as a strategic reserve of drinking water for the ÅÃ³dÅº Agglomeration. Precise knowledge of the long-term dynamics of the structure of the fish community, what was the aim of this study, is important for proper management to slow the eutrophication of the reservoir and prevent toxic algal blooms. To determine fish species composition, multimesh gill nets with mesh sizes ranging from 11 to 80 mm were used. From 1993 to 2015, gillnetting was conducted 1-2 times per month from June through November in two representative parts of the reservoir, and principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to explore the temporal variation in fish community structure expressed as the relative contribution of each species to the total fish biomass. Dominance fluctuated among four species in the fish community: common bream, Abramis brama (Linnaeus, 1758); roach, Rutilus rutilus (Linnaeus, 1758); white bream, Blicca bjoerkna (Linnaeus, 1758); and pike-perch, Sander lucioperca (Linnaeus, 1758). PCA revealed three principal components with eigenvalues larger than one that explained 73.3% of the observed variance in the temporal changes in fish community composition. A negative correlation was found between pike-perch biomass and roach biomass (r = 0.82), while a positive correlation was observed between the biomass of pike-perch and that of common bream (r = 0.73). Consequently, there was a highly negative correlation between the biomasses of common bream and roach (r = 0.80). Furthermore, an interesting temporal pattern was observed; from 1993 to 2000, the fish community was dominated by common bream and pike-perch but then shifted towards domination by roach and white bream, despite declining phosphorous and carbon concentrations. Recently, this trend has been reversed, and a more balanced fish community structure has been established. Fish community succession, which is usually reported to be a one-directional process in reservoirs, i.e., from a riverine fish or percid-dominated to a cyprinid (bream)-dominated state, was more ambiguous in SulejÃ³w Reservoir. This was likely a consequence of both restoration issues related to decreasing nutrient loads and the influence of zebra mussel, Dreissenapolymorpha invasion on the trophic relations in the reservoir.},

title={Feeding and nutrient excretion of the New Zealand freshwater mussel Echyridella menziesii (Hyriidae, Unionida): implications for nearshore nutrient budgets in lakes and reservoirs},
abstract={Native freshwater mussels (Bivalvia: Unionoida) can represent a large portion of benthic biomass, but their functional role is still poorly understood. We sampled Echyridella menziesii (Hyriidae) in six lakes from two regions of the North Island of New Zealand to develop general allometric relationships for predicting filtration, excretion and biodeposition rates. Experimental containers were set up in the field (no-flow conditions) to measure filtration and biodeposition using natural phytoplankton communities, and excretion in filtered lake water. Filtration rates were 0.02-1.3 L mussel-1 h-1 and increased with increasing mussel size (R2=0.13, P=0.023). Stable isotope analysis suggests that mussels also assimilate food from non-planktonic origins. Nitrogen excretion rates were 4-50<c2><a0>[mu]g N mussel-1 h-1 and increased with mussel size (R2=0.70, P<0.0001), with no difference between regions (ANCOVA, P>0.3). In contrast, phosphorus excretion rates did not vary with mussel size, and were much lower in Rotorua than Waikato lakes (2 vs 5<c2><a0>[mu]g P mussel-1 h-1). The reason for this regional difference is unclear, but suggests that mussels could contribute different N:P ratios to nearshore nutrient budgets in different types of lakes. Biodeposits represented 50-70% of the N, and 25-70% of the P recycled. Echyridella filters and excretes nutrients at rates similar to those measured in North American and European mussels (Unionidae, Margaritiferidae). Mussels could be important contributors of nutrients in areas where they are abundant, and their inclusion into nutrient budget models could improve the predictions of nearshore nutrient fluxes in lakes and reservoirs.},

title={Latitudinal incidence of phototrophic shell-degrading endoliths and their effects on mussel bed microclimates},
abstract={Aggregations of organisms commonly benefit their members by mitigating the effects of predators and environmental stresses. Mussel aggregations also form important intertidal matrices that support associated infaunal communities, the structures of which are largely shaped by the conditions within the interstitial spaces. Intertidal mussels are frequently parasitized by phototrophic endoliths that infest the shell and have thermoregulatory effects on both solitary and aggregated mussels by changing shell albedo. A large-scale sampling was carried out May-June 2016 along Portuguese and Moroccan shores to investigate a latitudinal gradient of endolithic infestation of the intertidal mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. Endolithic infestation increased towards lower latitudes most likely as a response of greater light availability. Additionally, artificial beds of either 100% non-infested or infested biomimetic mussels were used to test whether infestation alters the temperature and humidity of the interstitial spaces within beds, and if mussels surrounded by infested mussels experience lower body temperatures than those surrounded by non-infested ones. Conditions within beds of infested mussels were significantly cooler and more humid than in non-infested beds and individuals in the centre of infested mussel beds experienced significantly lower body temperatures. Under a scenario of warming climate, endolithic infestation of mussel beds might thus represent an ecological advantage not only for M. galloprovincialis as a species but also for the associated communities.},

abstract={Shipping has facilitated dispersion of exotic marine species, the genetic diversity of which may allow determination of their geographic origins. The economically important African brown mussel (Perna perna) is widely distributed along the southeastern and southern Brazilian coasts, and for which information on genetic diversity and origins is scarce. Five populations, along 2,500 km of Brazilian coast, were genetically characterized to test for homogeneity, verify haplotype and nucleotide diversity levels, and infer relationships among Brazilian and African P. perna. Mitochondrial COI gene sequences of 488 bp were obtained from 158 Brazilian P. perna, and from GenBank for other locations. The nuclear fragment rRNA18S-ITS1 was used as a species-specific marker. The five Brazilian locations were homogeneous, being composed of two mitochondrial haplogroups: haplogroup 1, with low genetic diversity, was linked to Tunisia, Morocco, and Mauritania, and haplogroup 2, with high genetic diversity, shared haplotypes with Brazil, Venezuela, western South Africa, Namibia and Angola. Haplotypes from southeastern Africa and from Oman were not found in Brazil. Patterns in genetic structure, diversity, and haplotype relationships of haplogroup 2 appear related to past trade routes between former African colonies and Brazil, whereas the low diversity of haplogroup 1 suggests more recent invasions.},

In this study, we aimed at comparing parasite assemblages and infection rates (prevalence and intensity) in different populations across the invasive range in the Baltic Sea (Denmark, Lithuania, Estonia and Finland). Infection rates were 56-60% across all locations except Lithuania (28%). However, the parasite assemblages in the sampled populations were dissimilar, each location having unique parasites. In addition, many of the parasites were generalists commonly infecting native fish species. Based on the results of this study and those previously conducted in the Baltic Sea, the round goby has not retained parasites from its area of origin, but instead has been successively colonized by native generalist parasites. Although variable, overall parasite richness is still quite low around the Baltic compared to the native areas (34 vs 71 taxa, respectively). Also, prevalence and mean infection intensities in the Baltic Sea are significantly lower than in the native areas. Therefore, the invasion success of the round goby in the Baltic Sea can at least partly be attributed to enemy release, in this case shedding a significant proportion of their native parasite load.},

abstract={North America is home to both native and invasive earthworms acting as ecosystem engineers as they build burrows that can serve as habitat for other species or otherwise alter soil structure, affecting nutrient cycling and other ecosystem processes. Here I determine where and what earthworm species commonly occur in my study area, and compare effects of native and invasive earthworms on the common woodland salamander, Plethodon cinereus, in field surveys and laboratory experiments. The native earthworm Eisenoides carolinensis was the most common earthworm, followed by two invasive species Dendrobaena octaedra and Octolasion tyrtaeum. The presence of O. tyrtaeum was associated with a narrower O-horizon (i.e., organic layer in the soil). Using structural equation modeling to explore direct and indirect pathways of these three most common earthworm species on salamanders, I found O. tyrtaeum occurrence was negatively correlated with nighttime salamander counts, a proxy for total salamander numbers, mediated by negative effects on O-horizon depth and microinvertebrate numbers. In the laboratory, O. tyrtaeum and D. octaedra consumed more leaf litter per gram of earthworm per day than the native E. carolinensis. However, salamanders consumed earthworms and used burrows of all native and invasive species of earthworms similarly. The potential for negative indirect effects of the invasive earthworm O. tyrtaeum on P. cinereus was demonstrated both in the field and laboratory, highlighting that seemingly small differences between native and invasive ecosystem engineers have the potential to significantly alter the effects of these closely related native and invasive organisms.},

In the Great Lakes, Diporeia, a benthic macroinvertebrate and primary food of native benthivores, declined following the introduction of invasive Dreissena mussels and these changes were reflected in fish diets. We examined the diets of deepwater sculpin Myoxocephalus thompsonii collected in bottom trawls during 2010-2014 in the main basin of Lake Huron, and compared these results to an earlier diet study (2003-2005) to assess if their diets have continued to change after a prolonged period of Dreissena mussel invasion and declined Diporeia densities. Diporeia, Mysis, Bythotrephes, and Chironomidae were consumed regularly and other diet items included ostracods, copepods, sphaerid clams, and fish eggs. The prey-specific index of relative importance calculated for each prey group indicated that Mysis importance increased at shallow ([less than or equal to]55 m) and mid (64-73 m) depths, while Diporeia importance increased offshore ([greater than or equal to]82 m). The average number of Diporeia consumed per fish increased by 10.0% and Mysis decreased by 7.5%, while the frequency of occurrence of Diporeia and Mysis remained comparable between time periods. The weight of adult deepwater sculpin (80 mm and 100 mm TL bins) increased between time periods; however, the change in weight was only significant for the 80 mm TL group (p<0.01). Given the historical importance of Diporeia in the Great Lakes, the examination of deepwater sculpin diets provides unique insight into the trophic dynamics of the benthic community in Lake Huron.},

We quantified thermal preferences and then compared leaf-litter processing rates at eight different temperatures (5.0-22.5<c2><a0><c2><b0>C) by the invasive freshwater crustacean Dikerogammarus villosus and the Great Britain native Gammarus pulex at a range of body sizes. D. villosus preferred warmer temperatures but there was considerable overlap in the range of temperatures that the two species occupied during preference trials. When matched for size, G. pulex had a greater leaf shredding efficiency than D. villosus, suggesting that invasion and subsequent displacement of the native amphipod will result in reduced ecosystem functioning. However, D. villosus is an inherently larger species and interspecific variation in shredding was reduced when animals of a representative size range were compared. D. villosus shredding rates increased at a faster rate than G. pulex with increasing temperature suggesting that climate change may offset some of the reduction in function. D. villosus, but not G. pulex, showed evidence of an ability to select those temperatures at which its shredding rate was maximised, and the activation energy for shredding in D. villosus was more similar to predictions from metabolic theory. While per capita and mass-corrected shredding rates were lower in the invasive D. villosus than the native G. pulex, our study provides novel insights in to how the interactive effects of metabolic function, body size, behavioural thermoregulation, and density produce antagonistic effects between anthropogenic stressors.},

abstract={Summary Phytoplankton communities can experience nonlinear responses to changing nutrient concentrations, but the nature of species shifts within phytoplankton is not well understood and few studies have explored responses of pelagic assemblages in large lakes. Using pelagic phytoplankton data from the Great Lakes, we assessed phytoplankton assemblage change-point responses to nutrients and invasive Dreissena, characterising community responses in a multi-stressor environment and determine whether species responses to in<c2><a0>situ nutrients can be approximated from nutrient loading. We demonstrate assemblage shifts in phytoplankton communities along major stressor gradients, particularly prominent in spring assemblages, providing insight into community thresholds at the lower end of the phosphorus gradient and species-stressor responses in a multi-stressor environment. We show that responses to water nutrient concentrations could not be estimated from large-scale nutrient loading data likely due to lake-specific retention time and long-term accumulation of nutrients. These findings highlight the potential for significant accumulation of nitrates in ultra-oligotrophic systems, nonlinear responses of phytoplankton at nutrient concentrations relevant to current water quality standards and system-specific (e.g. lake or ecozone) differences in phytoplankton responses likely due to differences in nutrient co-limitation and effects of dreissenids.},

abstract={Native to the central USA, the Blue Catfish Ictalurus furcatus and the Flathead Catfish Pylodictis olivaris have been widely introduced into many Atlantic slope rivers and are now found in several drainages of the Chesapeake Bay. Fisheries managers are concerned that these large, longâ€lived catfish species may be contributing to observed declines in anadromous species, such as the American Shad Alosa sapidissima, Blueback Herring A. aestivalis, and Alewife A. pseudoharengus, all of which once comprised major U.S. fisheries. We assessed spatiotemporal variability and selectivity in the diets of Blue Catfish and Flathead Catfish during the spawning migration of these alosines. Catfish stomachs were collected during Marchâ€“May in nontidal freshwater, tidal freshwater, oligohaline, and mesohaline portions of the James River. Diet contents were extracted from 2,495 catfish, 69.86% of which had prey items present in their foreguts (N = 1,743). We used DNA barcoding to identify degraded fish prey; nearly 30 taxa that would have otherwise gone undetected were identified in this manner. Blue Catfish had broad, omnivorous diets, whereas Flathead Catfish fed solely on other fish. Alosines were found in 4.46% of Blue Catfish stomachs and 16.67% of Flathead Catfish stomachs. Flathead Catfish selectively preyed on American Shad and, to a lesser degree, river herring. Alosines were consumed more frequently in nontidal freshwater areas, particularly in the highâ€gradient reach between Bosher Dam and the 14th Street Bridge, and predation on alosines peaked in April. Our results suggest that Flathead Catfish are likely to have a greater per capita impact on depleted alosines. Furthermore, dams and other obstacles to fish movement may increase alosinesâ€™ vulnerability to predation by large catfish.},

title={Cyanobacterial Toxins of the Laurentian Great Lakes, Their Toxicological Effects, and Numerical Limits in Drinking Water},
abstract={Cyanobacteria are ubiquitous phototrophic bacteria that inhabit diverse environments across the planet. Seasonally, they dominate many eutrophic lakes impacted by excess nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) forming dense accumulations of biomass known as cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms or cyanoHABs. Their dominance in eutrophic lakes is attributed to a variety of unique adaptations including N and P concentrating mechanisms, N2 fixation, colony formation that inhibits predation, vertical movement via gas vesicles, and the production of toxic or otherwise bioactive molecules. While some of these molecules have been explored for their medicinal benefits, others are potent toxins harmful to humans, animals, and other wildlife known as cyanotoxins. In humans these cyanotoxins affect various tissues, including the liver, central and peripheral nervous system, kidneys, and reproductive organs among others. They induce acute effects at low doses in the parts-per-billion range and some are tumor promoters linked to chronic diseases such as liver and colorectal cancer. The occurrence of cyanoHABs and cyanotoxins in lakes presents challenges for maintaining safe recreational aquatic environments and the production of potable drinking water. CyanoHABs are a growing problem in the North American (Laurentian) Great Lakes basin. This review summarizes information on the occurrence of cyanoHABs in the Great Lakes, toxicological effects of cyanotoxins, and appropriate numerical limits on cyanotoxins in finished drinking water.},

title={Accumulation of Microcystin (LR, RR and YR) in Three Freshwater Bivalves in <i>Microcystis aeruginosa</i> Bloom Using Dual Isotope Tracer},
abstract={Abstract: Stable isotope tracers were first applied to evaluate the Microcystis cell assimilation efficiency of Sinanodonta bivalves, since the past identification method has been limited to tracking the changes of each chl-a, clearity, and nutrient. The toxicity profile and accumulation of MC-LR, -RR and -YR in different organs (foot and digestive organs) from the three filter-feeders (Sinanodonta woodina, Sinanodonta arcaeformis, and Unio douglasiae) were assessed under the condition of toxigenic cyanobacteria (Microcystis aeruginosa) blooms through an in situ pond experiment using 13C and 15N dual isotope tracers. Chl-a concentration in the manipulated pond was dramatically decreased after the beginning of the second day, ranging from 217.5 to 15.6 <ce><bc>g<c2><b7>L<e2><88><92>1. The highest amount of MCs was incorporated into muscle and gland tissues in U. douglasiae during the study period, at nearly 2 or 3 times higher than in S.woodiana and S. arcaeformis. In addition, the incorporated 13C and 15N atom % in the U. douglasiae bivalve showed lower values than in other bivalves. The results demonstrate that U. douglasiae has less capacity to assimilate toxic cyanobacteria derived from diet. However, the incorporated 13C and 15N atom % of S. arcaeformis showed a larger feeding capacity than U. douglasiae and S. wodiana. Our results therefore also indicate that S. arcaeformis can eliminate the toxin more rapidly than U. douglasiae, having a larger detoxification capacity.},

title={To what extend the dam dredging can influence the background level of metals in the Rhine River: using chemical and biological long-term monitoring to answer},
abstract={Dredging generates remobilisation of sediments contaminated by non-degradable compounds such as metals, to which aquatic organisms can be exposed. This study aims at assessing the environmental impact of sediments remobilised in the Rhine River (France) during the dredging of Marckolsheim dam by pumping/dilution in 2013 on metal speciation and organisms' exposure. The monitoring coupling chemical and biological tools was performed 2 years before dredging operation on 2 sampling sites, upstream and downstream from the discharge of pumping/dilution, to acquire data on the natural variability of labile (DGT as passive samplers), dissolved and particulate concentrations of Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Mn, Pb and Zn in Rhine during full hydrological cycles. In parallel, size-calibrated zebra mussels were transplanted at both sites to monitor continuously metal bioavailability from particulate and dissolved fractions. This long-term monitoring allowed the establishment of reference baselines of Rhine water and mussels' contamination levels and subsequently, the detection of averred environmental changes due to the dredging. Indeed, Co and Mn accumulations in mussels exposed to the discharge were consistent with increasing labile species in Rhine whereas ones of Cr and Pb were likely due to an enhanced particulate bioavailability. Whatever the exposure route, the mussels recovered their basal metal contents 2 weeks after the end of dredging, suggesting a transient impact of sediment remobilisation on bioaccumulation. This long-term monitoring highlights the interest of coupling chemical and biological time-integrated tools for a better assessment of environmental risks because metallic exchanges between organisms and their media are complex and metal-specific.

title={Salt Marsh Denitrification Provides a Significant Nitrogen Sink in Barnegat Bay, New Jersey},
abstract={Denitrification in salt marshes can be an important removal mechanism for inorganic nitrogen, particularly in coastal estuaries subject to high nutrient loading and eutrophication. Barnegat Bay, New Jersey has had high nutrient loading in the northern part of the Bay and has exhibited symptoms of eutrophication. The first goal of this study was to examine seasonal denitrification, other N fluxes, and sediment oxygen demand in salt marshes of Barnegat Bay where inputs and concentrations of nutrients vary spatially within the Bay. Second, differences in N process rates among emergent vegetated marsh and permanently flooded isolated ponds were investigated. Finally, the percentage of the N load to the Bay removed by denitrification in the salt marshes of Barnegat Bay was calculated. It was hypothesized that denitrification rates would be the highest in summer and depend on water-column nutrient concentration. In addition, denitrification rate would be higher in vegetated marsh than in inundated ponds because of the aerobic/anaerobic interfaces present in marshes required by coupled nitrification-denitrification. Denitrification rate was three times greater in July than in October (p < 0.05). There were significant differences among marshes in N fluxes related to local availability of nutrients in the water column. Denitrification rates in vegetated marsh on thin sediment layers were more variable than in ponds. Overall, denitrification removed an average of 27.9% <c2><b1> 6.9% of the total N load transported to the Bay, highlighting the important ecosystem service that the marshes provide to the Bay.},

title={Competition between similar invasive species: modeling invasional interference across a landscape},
abstract={As the number of biological invasions increases, interactions between different invasive species will become increasingly important. Several studies have examined facilitative invader-invader interactions, potentially leading to invasional meltdown. However, if invader interactions are negative, invasional interference may lead to lower invader abundance and spread. To explore this possibility, we develop models of two competing invaders. A landscape simulation model examines the patterns created by two such species invading into the same region. We then apply the model to a case study of Carduus nutans L. and C. acanthoides L., two economically important invasive weeds that exhibit a spatially segregated distribution in central Pennsylvania, USA. The results of these spatially-explicit models are generally consistent with the results of classic Lotka-Volterra competition models, with widespread coexistence predicted if interspecific effects are weaker than intraspecific effects for both species. However, spatial segregation of the two species (with lower net densities and no further spread) may arise, particularly when interspecific competition is stronger than intraspecific competition. A moving area of overlap may result when one species is a superior competitor. In the Carduus system, our model suggests that invasional interference will lead to lower levels of each species when together, but a similar net level of thistle invasion due to the similarity of intra- and interspecific competition. Thus, invasional interference may have important implications for the distribution and management of invasive species.},

abstract={Caves are some of the least-known ecosystems on Earth and long-term ecological studies and population size estimates are very rare. Genus Congeria is a Tertiary relict that comprises three species from Dinaric karst area; C. kusceri, C. jalzici and C. mulaomerovici, each with very limited distribution. They are the only known cave bivalves and in contrast to many other cave species, they form populations with high densities. We estimated that the population of C. kusceri in Jama u Predolcu is between 72,454 and 72,906 individuals. The highest density occurred between one and three meters depth, and reached maximum of 1,625 individuals per square meter. Here we also present the results of a two-year water temperature and water level survey in several C. kusceri and C. jalzici localities. Data loggers showed that C. jalzici occurs in colder caves and higher water level oscillations then C. kusceri. From our data, it is obvious that the natural hydrological conditions in Congeria habitats were seriously altered. This and a series of other threats led to Congeria species being highly endangered. During low water levels, a part of the bivalve population becomes exposed to air in most localities. Uniquely, they are active during that period and are able to survive those conditions for more than 2 months.},

abstract={Despite their role as ecosystem engineers, which is in large part a consequence of their suspension feeding activities, the early life history of unionid mussels is not well understood. We examined the suspension feeding rates (i.e., clearance rates, CR) of recently metamorphosed juvenile Lampsilis siliquoidea (1-4 week old), Lampsilis fasciola (1-3 week old), Villosa iris (2 week old), and Ligumia nasuta (1 week old) under ecologically relevant flux conditions in a recirculating racetrack flow chamber system. The range of velocities examined was determined experimentally using a permeameter containing riverbed material (63<c2><a0>[mu]m to 6.5 cm diameter) in which juvenile mussels are thought to reside. The CR of the juvenile unionid species increased linearly with algal flux and the ranking of CR among species was V. iris > L. siliquoidea > L. nasuta > L. fasciola. CR also increased with the age (or size) of the mussel cohort but within a species CR increased non-linearly with shell length of the individual. These results provide new insight into the feeding abilities of recently metamorphosed juvenile mussels as well as potential threats to their growth and survival, which contributes to our understanding of their habitat requirements and may assist in the conservation of this imperiled taxon.},

title={Invasive crayfish impacts on native fish diet and growth vary with fish life stage},
abstract={Assessing the impacts of invasive organisms is a major challenge in ecology. Some widespread invasive species such as crayfish are potential competitors and reciprocal predators of ecologically and recreationally important native fish species. Here, we examine the effects of signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) on the growth, diet, and trophic position of the chub (Squalius cephalus) in four rivers in Britain. Growth rates of 0+ chub were typically lower in sympatric populations with signal crayfish compared with allopatric populations, and this effect could be traced through to 2+ chub in one river. However, growth rates of older chub (5+ to 6+) were typically higher in the presence of crayfish. Sympatry with crayfish resulted in lower chub length-at-age and mass-at-age in half of the rivers sampled, with no change detected in the other rivers. Stable isotope analyses (<ce><b4>13C and <ce><b4>15N) revealed that both chub and crayfish were omnivorous, feeding at multiple trophic levels and occupying similar trophic positions. We found some evidence that chub trophic position was greater at invaded sites on one river, with no difference detected on a second river. Mixing models suggested crayfish were important food items for both small and large chub at invaded sites. This study provides evidence that invasive species can have both positive and negative effects on different life stages of a native species, with the net impact likely to depend on responses at the population level.},

In the Iguassu River, the species was recorded in 2001; however, it is unknown how it was introduced and spread. Adults and larvae were sampled in Iguassu and Paran<c3><a1> Rivers, and the genetic profiles were compared. The species was absent in the upper reaches and only larvae were found, in low densities, in intermediary reaches. The L. fortunei populations from the lower Iguassu River presented no genetic differentiation among themselves, suggesting strong connectivity, and were significantly different from the Paran<c3><a1> River populations, most likely because of Iguassu Falls. Furthermore, the results suggest that the Paran<c3><a1> River represents the source of propagules to the Iguassu River. Generally, no significant differences were observed between the genetic structure inferred from adults and larvae. Only the population from the Iguassu National Park, a lotic environment, differed from the remaining subpopulations. The characterization of genetic profile using larval stages of L. fortunei populations was satisfactory, and represents an important protocol for studying the population genetics of aquatic species with planktonic larval stages.},

abstract={We compiled a list of 148 exotic species in French inland freshwaters, comprising 36 plant species and 112 animals, including 50 invertebrates, 7 amphibians, 1 reptile, 25 fish, 22 birds and 7 mammals. Spatial distribution maps and cumulative analyses for most species indicate that exotic plants are distributed more along the west coast of France and, to a lesser extent, the Rhone basin, whereas exotic animals are clearly clumped in the north-east (Rhine Basin). The rate of introductions has increased exponentially over time. The most recent introductions (since 1992) have occurred in the Rhine Basin, from where they have then spread. Twenty-five species on our list are among the '100 worst invasive species of Europe' (DAISIE) and 11 among the worst in the world (IUCN), with six species included on both lists. The potential cumulative impact of exotic species tends to be heterogeneous across France, though the north-east appears to be more disturbed, especially by animal species. Additional research is needed on criteria for prioritising intervention measures that will help stakeholders make objective choices in the management of exotic species in aquatic ecosystems.},

abstract={One of the main assumed impacts of invasive gobies is predation on benthic macroinvertebrates. Despite numerous dietary studies, however, quantitative evaluations of impact in European river systems are scarce. Here, we investigate the impact of tubenose (Proterorhinus semilunaris, Heckel 1837) and round (Neogobius melanostomus, Pallas 1814) gobies on macroinvertebrates in a lowland river (River Dyje, Czech Republic) by allowing and preventing gobiid access to rip-rap substrate naturally colonised by invertebrates at two sites (Site 1--tubenose goby only, Site 2--tubenose and round gobies). Gobies had a negative impact on invertebrates at both sites, with overall invertebrate density reduced by 15% (ca. 17.9 g m-2 per year) at Site 1 and 36% (ca. 23.6 g m-2 per year) at Site 2. Both species showed increased impact in summer and ingested larger invertebrates preferentially, resulting in an overall reduction in invertebrate body size. Tubenose gobies had a significant impact on Annelida, Gastropoda, Crustacea and Ephemeroptera nymphs, while tubenose and round goby together impacted Annelida, Bivalvia (Dreissena), Gastropoda, Crustacea, Ephemeroptera nymphs, Odonata nymphs and Chironomidae larvae. Our results confirm that round and tubenose gobies can have a significant negative impact on aquatic invertebrate density and community composition.},

abstract={Detection of chemical cues of predators and food resources is a key for the behaviour of many species in aquatic ecosystems. We checked whether predator origin and diet, containing potential food and/or alarm signals, affect the behaviour of omnivorous prey partly sharing their diet with a top predator. We conducted y-maze experiments to study the responses of invasive omnivorous and cannibalistic amphipods (Dikerogammarus villosus and Pontogammarus robustoides) to chemical cues of fish predators, injured amphipods and chironomid larvae (common amphipod food). As the predators, we used the goby Babka gymnotrachelus (sympatric with the amphipods) and piranha Pygocentrus nattereri (allopatric to the amphipods). The fish were either starved or fed amphipods or chironomids. D. villosus preferred predators fed chironomids and conspecifics as well as crushed conspecifics and chironomids, but avoided both hungry predators. Thus, D. villosus may perceive the presence of a top predator as an indication of both food resource and predation risk. P. robustoides avoided predators fed both amphipods (particularly conspecifics) and their alarm substances. The responses of both species depended more on the predator diet than on its species, which is likely to facilitate the recognition of allopatric predators and survival in newly invaded areas.},

title={Trophic signatures of co-existing invasive and indigenous mussels: selective feeding or different metabolic pathways?},
abstract={Species invasions can have profound ecological impacts, including changes in patterns of distribution, abundance and diversity of native species, altering food-web dynamics and ecosystem functioning. In the marine benthic environment temperature, predation, competition for space and wave action exposure are some of the main factors that determine invasion success; however, the importance of food availability for invasive species has been underestimated. The present study investigates the diets of two mussel species, Mytilus galloprovincialis and Perna perna, that occur in mixed-species mussel beds, using fatty acid (FA) and stable isotope (SI) approaches over two periods of time in 2012 and 2014. With the exception of one site, we found no significant differences in the SI signatures between species, while strong dissimilarities were present in their FA signatures. Both species showed signatures of exposure to good food quality, however, neither showed links to specific dietary trophic markers. The FA differences observed between species could be related to food selectivity by one or both species or more likely by different metabolic pathways. Further investigations are needed to clarify the pattern observed; however, the results suggested that the food environment was not an important factor in determining the success of the invasive species.},

title={Spatially explicit risk assessment for coastal invaders under different management scenarios},
abstract={Biological invasions are particularly challenging in marine environments, where control strategies are scarce and efforts to reduce the abundance of the invader are costly and difficult, often representing insurmountable challenges. However, the magnitude of the impact of the invasion depends not only on the characteristics of the invading species, but also on the inherent features of the receiving environment; managing the environmental matrix could therefore be the best option for preventing or reducing undesired effects. The objective of the present work was to develop a spatially explicit risk-based approach to evaluate the effectiveness of different management practices designed to mitigate the potential impacts of the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) in the Bah<c3><ad>a Blanca estuary (38<c2><b0>50'S, 62<c2><b0>20'W). A Risk Index (RI) was constructed to assess the potential negative impact of oyster bed expansion on environmental values and human health. RI maps were built to compare the potential effects of different management options in terms of risk reduction. An integral sanitation program within the coastal zone produced the largest reduction in the areas previously ranked as under very low, low, medium, high, and very high risk. Treatment of domestic sewage produced a major reduction in the areas under high and medium risk, mainly in the inner zone of the estuary, but changes in the area under very high risk were negligible. Removal of oysters at specific locations had a modest effect on risk reduction in terms of the whole area, but produced significant improvements at a local scale.},

abstract={The world's freshwater molluscan fauna is facing unprecedented threats from habitat loss and degradation. Declines in native populations are mostly attributed to the human impact, which results in reduced water quality. The objectives of our survey were to analyse the structure of the mollusc communities in a medium-sized lowland river and to determine the most important environmental variables at different spatial scales, including landscape structure, catchment land use and instream environmental factors that influence their structure. Our survey showed that a medium-sized river, that flows through areas included in the European Ecological Natura 2000 Network Programme of protected sites, provides diverse instream habitats and niches that support 47 mollusc species including Unio crassus, a bivalve of Community interest, whose conservation requires the designation of a special conservation area under the Habitats Directive Natura 2000. This survey showed that mollusc communities are impacted by several environmental variables that act together at multiple scales. The landscape structure within buffer zones, catchment land use and instream environmental variables were all important and influenced the structure of mollusc communities. Therefore, they should all be taken into consideration in the future restoration of the river, future management projects and programmes for the conservation of biodiversity in running waters. The results of this study may be directly applicable for the rehabilitation of river ecosystems and are recommended to stakeholders in their future decision concerning landscape planning, monitoring species and their habitats, conservation plans and management in accordance with the requirements of sustainable development.},

title={High Frequency Non-invasive (HFNI) Bio-Sensors As a Potential Tool for Marine Monitoring and Assessments},
abstract={Marine ecosystems all over the globe are facing multiple simultaneous stressors including rapid climatic change and increased resource exploitation, such as fishing, petroleum exploration and shipping. The EU-funded DEVOTES project (DEVelopment Of innovative Tools for understanding marine biodiversity and assessing good Environmental Status) aims to better understand the relationships between pressures from human activities and climatic influences and their effects on marine ecosystems. To achieve these goals, it is necessary among others, to test and validate innovative monitoring tools to improve our understanding of ecosystem and biodiversity changes. This paper outlines the application of a high frequency non-invasive (HFNI) valvometer as a potential tool for long-term marine monitoring and assessments. The principle of the method is based on the regular gaping behaviour (closing and opening of the valves) of bivalve molluscs and the fact that physical or chemical stressors disrupt that gaping reference pattern. Bivalve gaping behaviour is monitored in the natural environment, remotely, continuously over a time period of years, requirements that must be fulfilled if bivalve behaviour is to be a useful biomonitoring tool. Here, we review the literature and highlight potential uses of the HFNI valvometry as a biosensor, to monitor and provide early-warning alerts of changes in water quality, such as global temperature increase, releases of contaminants and toxic algal blooms. Finally, potential relevant applications for monitoring and assessing environmental status of marine waters in the context of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive are identified. Relevant descriptors, Criteria and Indicators of Good Environmental Status that might be monitored using the HFNI valvometer are discussed for monitoring bathing beaches and harbours, petroleum installations and aquaculture sites.},

title={Effect of starvation and subsequent feeding on glycogen concentration, behavior and mortality in the golden mussel Limnoperna fortunei (Dunker, 1857) (Bivalvia: Mytilidae)},
abstract={The success of Limnoperna fortunei as an invasive species is related to its physiological plasticity that allows them to endure adverse environmental conditions. Starvation tolerance is considered to be an important trait associated with bivalve invasiveness. In natural ecosystems, food resources can vary during the year, exposing mussels to variable periods of starvation or limited food availability. Thus, mussels have developed physiological strategies to tolerate and survive fluctuations in food availability. Glycogen concentration has been used in different monitoring studies as an indicator of the nutritional condition of bivalves. The aim of this study was to investigate the physiological responses of L. fortunei based on the glycogen concentrations of specimens under four treatments, comprising different combinations of feeding and starvation, during 125 days. The experiment was carried out in two phases. In the phase I, mussels were divided in two treatments: starvation (S) and feeding (F). After 100 days, tissue samples were collected to quantify glycogen concentrations and, each phase I group was divided in two subgroups: starvation (S) and feeding (F), resulting in four treatments. In the phase II, that lasted 25 days, starvation specimens (S) from phase I were allowed to feed (starvation-feeding treatment , or S-F), or continued to undergo starvation (starvation-starvation treatment , or S-S) and the feeding specimens (F) continued feeding (feeding-feeding group, or F-F), or were subjected to starvation (feeding-starvation treatment , or F-S). Behavior (valve-closing) and mortality were recorded in 24 h intervals. After the 25 days (phase II) all specimens were killed, and their soft tissue was removed to quantify glycogen concentrations. The glycogen concentration of the S-F treatment was lower than that of the F-S treatment, which was initially allowed to feed (phase I) and then subjected to starvation (phase II). Stability in the glycogen concentrations was observed when the phase II feeding conditions were maintained during the experiments, as observed in the S-S (continued starvation) and F-F (continued feeding) treatments. Based on our glycogen concentrations results, the golden mussel shows a higher tolerance to starvation (125 days) than has previously been published, which suggests that its tolerance strongly influences its invasive behavior.},

title={Cross-habitat effects shape the ecosystem consequences of co-invasion by a pelagic and a benthic consumer},
abstract={Invasive species can have major impacts on ecosystems, yet little work has addressed the combined effects of multiple invaders that exploit different habitats. Two common invaders in aquatic systems are pelagic fishes and crayfishes. Pelagic-oriented fish effects are typically strong on the pelagic food web, whereas crayfish effects are strong on the benthic food web. Thus, co-invasion may generate strong ecological responses in both habitats. We tested the effects of co-invasion on experimental pond ecosystems using two widespread invasive species, one pelagic (western mosquitofish) and one benthic (red swamp crayfish). As expected, mosquitofish had strong effects on the pelagic food web, reducing the abundance of Daphnia and causing a strong trophic cascade (increase in phytoplankton). Crayfish had strong effects on the benthic food web, reducing the abundance of benthic filamentous algae. Yet, we also found evidence for important cross-habitat effects. Mosquitofish treatments reduced the biomass of benthic filamentous algae, and crayfish treatments increased Daphnia and phytoplankton abundance. Combined effects of mosquitofish and crayfish were primarily positively or negatively additive, and completely offsetting for some responses, including gross primary production (GPP). Though co-invasion did not affect GPP, it strongly shifted primary production from the benthos into the water column. Effects on snail abundance revealed an interaction; snail abundance decreased only in the presence of both invaders. These results suggest that cross-habitat effects of co-invaders may lead to a variety of ecological outcomes; some of which may be unpredictable based on an understanding of each invader alone.},

title={Simulation of Terrigenous Minerogenic Particle Populations in Time and Space in Cayuga Lake, New York, in Response to Runoff Events},
abstract={The important effects of minerogenic particles delivered from watersheds on optical and phosphorus metrics of lacustrine water quality have recently been quantified through measurements of the projected area of these particles per unit volume of water (PAVm), using an individual particle analysis technique. A mass balance type model for PAVm, partitioned according to the contributions of four size classes, is developed and tested for Cayuga Lake, New York, supported by long-term monitoring of PAVm in the lake and its primary tributaries. The model represents the source of PAVm of tributary inputs and three in-lake loss processes: (1) size-dependent settling, (2) enhancement of settling through aggregation, and (3) filter feeding by dreissenid mussels. The central roles of major runoff events and localized external loads of minerogenic sediment at one end of the lake in driving patterns of PAVm in time and space are successfully simulated, including (1) the higher PAVm levels in a shallow area ("shelf") adjoining these inputs, relative to pelagic waters, following runoff events; and (2) the positive dependence of the shelf increases on the magnitude of the event. Analyses conducted with the model establish that settling, with aggregation enhancement, dominates the loss of PAVm from the water column of the shelf, while mussel filtration increases in relative importance in pelagic waters. The utility of PAVm predictions to quantify the effects of these particles on optical and phosphorus concentration metrics of water quality is established.},

title={Niche partitioning between invasive and native corixids (Hemiptera, Corixidae) in south-west Spain},
abstract={Trichocorixa verticalis verticalis, a North American water boatman, is the only alien corixid in European fresh waters. It has rapidly spread, becoming the dominant corixid in and around the Do<c3><b1>ana protected area in SW Spain. Its high abundance and similar morphology to native corixids suggest that T. verticalis may impact them through competition for food. Here we used stable isotopes of nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) and Bayesian analytical tools to investigate niche partitioning between T. verticalis and the native water boatman Sigara lateralis and Sigara scripta through a combination of experimental and field data. Species sampled from permanent ponds and laboratory aquaria could be separated based on their isotopic values (<ce><b4>15N and <ce><b4>13C). S. lateralis consistently showed higher <ce><b4>15N values than T. verticalis, suggesting that the invasive species may be feeding at a lower trophic position and relying more on herbivory than its native competitors. This was particularly true for the T. verticalis nymph stage, which showed lower <ce><b4>15N values compared to adults, indicating ontogenetic dietary shifts. In contrast, native corixids and the invasive species showed similar isotopic compositions in temporary habitats at different stages in the flooding-desiccation cycle, suggesting some degree of niche overlap and a slight reduction in trophic level for S. lateralis when inhabiting ephemeral systems. The combination of experimental and field data can help elucidate trophic interactions during a biological invasion. Stable isotopes provided insights into the trophic ecology of this invasive species and into the mechanisms facilitating co-existence with native species.},

abstract={All known rivers in Scotland with recent records of freshwater pearl mussels Margaritifera margaritifera were surveyed in 2013-2015 using a standard methodology. Freshwater pearl mussel populations were classed as: (i) apparently extinct in 11 rivers, (ii) not successfully recruiting in 44 rivers, and (iii) evidence of recent successful recruitment in 71 rivers. On a regional basis, a high proportion of extant populations were located in North and West Scotland. In all regions extant populations were characterised by low pearl mussel densities, with 97 of 115 extant Scottish populations defined as 'rare' (0.1-0.9 mussels per 1 m 2) or 'scarce' (1.0-9.9 mussels per 1 m 2). Only 18 Scottish rivers now hold pearl mussel populations in densities that are considered to be 'common' (10-19.9 mussels per 1 m 2) or 'abundant' (>20 mussels per 1 m 2). Based on survey evidence, the number of apparently extinct pearl mussel populations in Scottish rivers is now 73. The decline is particularly pronounced in the West Highlands and Western Isles strongholds. The key threats are: (i) pearl fishing, (ii) low host fish densities, (iii) pollution/water quality, (iv) climate change and habitat loss, (v) hydrological management/river engineering and (vi) 'other factors', such as non-native invasive species. Over the last 100 years this endangered species has been lost from much of its former Holarctic range. Scotland's extant M. margaritifera populations continue to be of international importance, but their continued decline since the first national survey in 1998 is of great concern.},

abstract={The invasive clam Corbicula fluminea causes severe environmental and economic impacts in invaded sites and fouled water-dependent industries. The biological control of invasive species has potential as an effective, safe and low-cost tool. The potential of using direct (clam consumption) and indirect approaches (predator-avoidance behaviour) to control the pest was evaluated, aiming at establishing a proof-of-principle regarding the suitability of such strategies in confined settings (e.g. pipelines, channels, raw water tanks and other water-dependent facilities). Invertebrate (Procambarus clarkii) and vertebrate (Lepomis gibbosus, Luciobarbus bocagei) predators were examined for their control potential. In feeding experiments, barbels foraged upon C. fluminea but ingested very few clams, and clam consumption by crayfish was only observed in the smallest size class (<1 cm). Additional experiments linked these results to the protective role of the clam's shell. In practical terms, the potential of the fish species as C. fluminea predators is limited, but crayfish can be important predators of small clams. In a second set of experiments, putative predator avoidance by clams was assessed in dual-choice aquaria. Refuge availability, predator diet and light conditions were taken into account. Clam avoidance was observed under particular conditions, but the amplitude of dislocation was limited.},

title={The Application of Long-Lived Bivalve Sclerochronology in Environmental Baseline Monitoring},
abstract={Assessments of the impact of construction, operation and removal of large infrastructures and other human activities on the marine environment are limited because they do not fully quantify the background baseline conditions and relevant scales of natural variability. Baselines as defined in Environmental Impact Assessments typically reflect the status of the environment and its variability drawn from published literature and augmented with some short term site specific characterization. Consequently, it can be difficult to determine whether a change in the environment subsequent to industrial activity is within or outside the range of natural background variability representative of an area over decades or centuries. An innovative approach that shows some promise in overcoming the limitations of traditional baseline monitoring methodology involves the analysis of shell material (sclerochronology) from molluscs living upon or within the seabed in potentially affected areas. Bivalves especially can be effective biomonitors of their environment over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. A rapidly expanding body of research has established that numerous characteristics of the environment can be reflected in morphological and geochemical properties of the carbonate shell material in bivalve shells, as well as in functional responses such as growth rates. In addition, the annual banding pattern in shells can provide an absolute chronometer of environmental variability and/or industrial effects. Further, some species of very long-lived bivalves can be crossdated back in time, like trees, by comparing the annual banding patterns in their shells. It is therefore feasible to develop extended timeseries of certain marine environmental variables that can provide important insights into long temporal scales of baseline variability. We review recent innovative work on the shell structure, morphology and geochemistry of bivalves and conclude that they have substantial potential for use as monitors of environmental variability and the effects of pollutants and disturbance.},

abstract={Human activities, both established and emerging, increasingly affect the provision of marine ecosystem services that deliver societal and economic benefits. Monitoring the status of marine ecosystems and determining how human activities change their capacity to sustain benefits for society requires an evidence-based Integrated Ecosystem Assessment approach that incorporates knowledge of ecosystem functioning and services). Although there are diverse methods to assess the status of individual ecosystem components, none assesses the health of marine ecosystems holistically, integrating information from multiple ecosystem components. Similarly, while acknowledging the availability of several methods to measure single pressures and assess their impacts, evaluation of cumulative effects of multiple pressures remains scarce. Therefore, an integrative assessment requires us to first understand the response of marine ecosystems to human activities and their pressures and then develop innovative, cost-effective monitoring tools that enable collection of data to assess the health status of large marine areas. Conceptually, combining this knowledge of effective monitoring methods with cost-benefit analyses will help identify appropriate management measures to improve environmental status economically and efficiently. The European project DEVOTES (DEVelopment Of innovative Tools for understanding marine biodiversity and assessing good Environmental Status) specifically addressed these topics in order to support policy makers and managers in implementing the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive. Here, we synthesize our main innovative findings, placing these within the context of recent wider research, and identifying gaps and the major future challenges.},

title={Further improvements in water quality of the Dutch Borderlakes: two types of clear states at different nutrient levels},
abstract={The Borderlakes are a chain of ten shallow, largely artificial, interconnected lakes in the Netherlands. The ecological recovery of the central Borderlakes (viz. lake Veluwe and Wolderwijd) has been well documented. These lakes shifted from a eutrophic, Planktothrix dominated state in the 1970s to a clear state in 1996. Around 2010, the formerly hypertrophic, southern Borderlake Eem also reached a clear state, but at considerably higher nutrient levels. In this paper, monitoring data are used to compare these changes and identify the differences in driving processes and their consequences. The 1996 shift in Lake Veluwe was linked to increased fishery for benthivorous Bream, followed and stabilized by increase in Zebra Mussels and charophytes. Nutrients in Lake Eem decreased as well and Planktothrix disappeared here too in 1996, despite relatively high TP concentrations which remained stable over time. The start of the change into the clear state in this case also involved a decrease in the Bream population, but with a stronger additional role for dreissenids, particularly of Quagga Mussels. Remaining blooms of cyanobacteria almost disappeared, but the current situation in Lake Eem represents a different type of clear water state than in the central Borderlakes. This type is characterized by the combination of a relatively high phosphorus load, intense dreissenid filtration and filamentous macro-algae instead of either blooms of cyanobacteria or dominance of charophytes. With the dominant role of the River Eem, the relatively short residence time and increasing difficulty to bring down nutrient loading any further, the stability of this clear state depends on high densities (and filtration rates) of dreissenids.},

title={How to combat cyanobacterial blooms: strategy toward preventive lake restoration and reactive control measures},
abstract={Water managers worldwide are facing the serious problem of dense blooms of cyanobacteria in surface waters. In the quest for the optimal method to combat cyanobacterial dominance, many questions and many possible solutions arise. This paper presents a three-phase strategy to fight harmful cyanobacterial proliferation. Water managers who apply this strategy can generate a tailor-made set of measures. The three phases consist of (1) defining the ecological water quality targets of the waterbody in question, (2) assessing its current ecological state, and (3) selecting which measures will yield optimal results. The paper provides assistance in the quantitative diagnosis of the state of both shallow and deep temperate freshwater lakes by means of a lake system analysis, and presents a survey of measures. Measures are divided into two sets. Preventive measures are based on switching to a clear state (shallow lake) or reducing the overall cyanobacterial biomass (deep lake). They are subdivided into nutrient reduction, hydromorphological adjustments, and food web management. Concerning nutrient reduction, in many situations phosphorus management alone should suffice. Nitrogen management can be important to increase the species diversity of macrophytes, or to relieve downstream (marine) consequences. Control measures (including mitigation) have a direct impact on cyanobacterial blooms by biomass removal, flushing, or mixing; however, the number of proven technologies is limited.},

abstract={Depletion of phytoplankton biomass by the introduced reef-forming polychaete Ficopomatus enigmaticus has previously been observed in the Mar Chiquita lagoon (37<c2><b0>40'S 57<c2><b0>23'W; Argentina), but the effect of polychaetes on the higher trophic levels is still unknown. To evaluate the effect of this polychaete on the zooplankton assemblage, replicated mesocosm experiments (N = 10) were performed during spring, summer and winter. Mesocosms with reefs and without reefs were installed and grazing intensity and the effect on the zooplankton assemblage by the polychaetes were assessed. Our results show that the reefs of F. enigmaticus generate minor changes in overall composition of zooplankton assemblage. Although the structure of the zooplankton assemblage was different between seasons, the impact of the reefs was not significant in any of them. There was no relationship between the decline of food resource by grazing and changes in the structure of the zooplankton assemblage. Thus, contrary to our hypothesis, the grazing impact of the invasive polychaete on the biomass of primary producers did not generate cascading effects to higher trophic levels. However, changes in some components of the zooplankton assemblage (e.g. cladocerans) clearly show that the reefs of F. enigmaticus have the potential to affect the structure of the zooplankton community. The lack of data of community composition and abundance of zooplankton before the invasion limits the understanding of how this polychaete might have affected the structure and abundance of the zooplankton of this lagoon. Nevertheless this work suggests that these changes may not be so significant.},

title={Major changes in CO2 efflux when shallow lakes shift from a turbid to a clear water state},
abstract={Issue Title: Shallow Lakes in a Fast Changing World Lakes can be sources or sinks of carbon, depending on local conditions. Recent studies have shown that the CO2 efflux increases when lakes recover from eutrophication, mainly as a result of a reduction in phytoplankton biomass, leading to less uptake of CO2 by producers. We hypothesised that lake restoration by removal of coarse fish (biomanipulation) or invasion of mussels would have a similar effect. We studied 14-22 year time series of five temperate Danish lakes and found profound effects on the calculated CO2 efflux of major shifts in ecosystem structure. In two lakes, where limited colonisation of submerged macrophytes occurred after biomanipulation or invasion of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha), the efflux increased significantly with decreasing phytoplankton chlorophyll a. In three lakes with major interannual variation in macrophyte abundance, the efflux declined with increasing macrophyte abundance in two of the lakes, while no relation to macrophytes or chlorophyll a was found in the third lake, likely due to high groundwater input to this lake. We conclude that clearing water through invasive mussels or lake restoration by biomanipulation may increase the CO2 efflux from lakes. However, if submerged macrophytes establish and form dense beds, the CO2 efflux may decline again.},

abstract={The round goby Neogobius melanostomus has successfully invaded much of the Baltic Sea. However, very little is known about the feeding habits of the species in this newly invaded environment. Our laboratory experiment showed that the round goby is able to effectively consume a diverse variety of prey when given the choice between dominant benthic invertebrates: bivalves (Macoma balthica, Mytilus trossulus, Cerastoderma glaucum) and amphipods (Gammarus spp.). In contrast consumption of the gastropod (Theodoxus fluviatilis) was very low in all provided combinations. Nevertheless, the round goby had no statistically significant preference towards any of the prey taxa. The round goby exhibited size-specific consumption of M. trossulus, with smaller individuals being consumed at least 25% more than larger size classes. In addition elevated prey density resulted in higher consumption of prey by the fish. The broad diet suggests that shifting densities of benthic invertebrate prey has little influence on the further dispersal of the round goby in the Baltic Sea as the species is potentially able to switch between several native invertebrate taxa. This opportunistic feeding behaviour has likely favoured this invasion and ensured success of the species in the invaded ecosystem.},

Foremost, we conclude the remoteness of Arctic and Subarctic systems such as Alaska is no longer a protective attribute against invasions, as transportation pathways now reach throughout these regions. Rather, high costs of operating in remote Arctic and Subarctic systems hinders detection of infestations and limits eradication or mitigation, emphasizing management priorities of prevention and containment of aquatic plant invaders in Alaska and other Arctic and Subarctic systems.},

abstract={Urbanization strongly impacts aquatic ecosystems by decreasing water quality and altering water cycles. Today, much effort is put towards the restoration and conservation of urban waterbodies to enhance ecosystem service provision, leading to liveable and sustainable cities. To enable a sustainable management of waterbodies, the quantification of the temporal and spatial variability of pollution levels and biogeochemical processes is essential. Stable isotopes have widely been used to identify sources of pollution in ecosystems. For example, increased nitrogen levels in waterbodies are often accompanied with a higher nitrogen stable isotope signature (<ce><b4>15N), which can then be detected in higher trophic levels such as mussels. The main aim of this study was to assess the suitability of nitrogen stable isotopes as measured in mussels (Mytilus edulis), as an indicator able to resolve spatial and temporal variability of nitrogen pollution in an urban, tidally influenced estuary (Swan River estuary in Western Australia). Nitrogen concentrations were generally low and nitrogen stable isotope values of nitrate throughout the estuary were well within natural values of uncontaminated groundwater, organic nitrate from soils, or marine-derived sources, indicating groundwater inflow rather than pollution by human activity was responsible for differences between sites. The <ce><b4>15N signature in mussels was very stable over time within each site which indicated that mussels can be used as time-integrated sentinel organisms in urban systems. In addition, our study shows that the nature of the relationship between <ce><b4>15N in the mussels and the nitrate in the water can provide insights into site-specific biogeochemical transformation of nutrients. We suggest that mussels and other sentinel organisms can become a robust tool for the detection and characterization of the dynamics of a number of emerging anthropogenic pollutants of concern in urban water systems.},

The 44 habitat sites included the core soda lakes in eastern Africa (Bogoria, Nakuru, Elmentaita, Oloidien), where the highest numbers of flamingos were observed, and five breeding sites in eastern and southern Africa as well as in north-western India. A reference describing the diversity of microphytes was established including members of three orders of cyanobacteria and nine orders of eukaryotic algae that potentially could act as food source for Lesser Flamingos. Preferred food organisms consisted of filamentous cyanobacteria, mainly Arthrospira, as well as benthic diatoms. Further investigation on the suitability of other microphytes as alternative flamingo diet revealed the food potential of chlorophytes and euglenophytes. This paper discusses a phycological perspective in the feeding ecology of Lesser Flamingos.

Invertebrate functional and life history traits are robust indicators of environmental quality and ecosystem functioning, yet surprisingly few studies have utilized trait-based approaches to assess impacts of human development to lake littoral communities. We assessed environmental characteristics of human development that impact functional diversity and structure the trait composition of invertebrate communities in lakes of northwestern United States. Multiple linear regressions revealed that functional diversity declined with increasing watershed development, lake total phosphorus, and littoral macrophyte cover. Results from multivariate constrained ordination and fourth corner analysis indicated that high phosphorus concentrations and abundant macrophyte cover removed taxa with semivoltine life histories and filter feeders from lake communities, and that both regional ecosystem and local habitat characteristics of human development were important determinants of invertebrate community structure. Human development had particularly pronounced effects on invertebrate communities in the sublittoral zone, for which overall community abundances declined. Our study indicates that human development favors lake communities dominated by multivoltine taxa and herbivores, which may have important implications for energy flow among terrestrial, littoral, and pelagic food webs.},

Of particular interest from the fisheries management point of view is how the invasive New Zealand mud snail, Potamopyrgus antipodarum, can alter the diet of fish and crayfish. If the snail is somewhat resistant to predation, it cannot be easily included into predators' diet. We examine the direct interactions between the introduced P. antipodarum and benthivorous predators local to temperate lakes through laboratory experiments and field surveys. Field survey showed that P. antipodarum dominated in the macroinvertebrate communities of the studied lakes. Feeding experiments indicated low consumption of P. antipodarum by most of its potential predators. Field diet survey showed that the main fish species did not significantly consume P. antipodarum. Moreover, it was ascertained that this snail can survive passing through the gastrointestinal tract of most studied fish species. Consequently, as local fish do not consume P. antipodarum, a part of lake primary production becomes locked in lower trophic levels. Therefore, there is a legitimate concern that the invasion of this snail may reduce the direct flow of primary production towards higher trophic levels in temperate lakes.},

An understanding of the mechanisms involved in the successful introduction, establishment and invasion of exotic taxa is essential in predicting of changes in biodiversity and community structure. Symbiont-mediated interactions between exotic and native hosts are of special interest due to the indirect effects on population dynamics. The aim of this study was to estimate the presence of symbionts in Chinese pond mussel Sinanodonta woodiana (Lea, 1834), an exotic species of mussel in European fresh waters. The number of 340 individuals of S. woodiana was collected from Polish water bodies, including thermally heated lakes and fish ponds with natural thermal regime. The examination of mussels revealed the presence of Rhipidocotyle campanula sporocysts and cercariae (Digenea: Bucephalidae), water mites Unionicola ypsilophora (Acari: Hydracarina), oligochaetes Chaetogaster limnaei limnaei (Oligochaeta: Naididae) and chironomids Glyptotendipes sp. (Diptera: Chironomidae). The global prevalence of mussels inhabited by Ch. limnaei limnaei was 7.6%, by water mites and chironomids 3.5%, and by R. campanula cercariae 2.0%. The significant difference in the number of mussels with symbionts was identified between heated lakes and fish ponds (<cf><87>2=4.15; df=1, P=0.04), with a higher global prevalence of mussels in fish ponds (22.3%) compared to heated lakes (13.7%). R. campanula or U. ypsilophora were only found in mussels collected from thermally polluted lakes or fish ponds, respectively. Chironomid larvae and oligochaetes occurred in both types of water bodies. However, Glyptotendipes sp. inhabited mussels with a higher global prevalence in fish ponds than in thermally polluted lakes, while Ch. limnaei limnaei was observed mainly in hosts from heated lakes, and only from one fish pond that were not drained. Our findings indicate that the alien Chinese pond mussel S. woodiana can be inhabited by different groups of symbionts native to Europe, including digenetic trematodes. The results show that S. woodiana can affect directly and indirectly water habitats and the vulnerability of infection with symbionts depends on ecosystem conditions. It occurs that even considerable climate differences do not pose a barrier for exotic mussels to spread.},

However, the mechanisms by which invasive mussels influence the food uptake by local consumers are little known. We tested the interactive effects of the invasive mussel Arcuatula senhousia and the native clam Ruditapes decussatus on the uptake of 13C-enriched microalgae, Isochrysis sp., by two polychaetes, the surface deposit feeder Cirriformia tentaculata and the sub-surface deposit feeder Phylo foetida. Polychaetes were exposed to two different densities of A. senhousia and R. decussatus used alone or together. In each treatment, the 13C-concentration throughout the sediment horizon (0-0.5, 0.5-2.5 and 2.5-5 cm) was also quantified. Results showed that, irrespective of bivalve densities, the 13C-uptake by C. tentaculata was lower in the presence of the two bivalves together than in the presence of one bivalve species (either A. senhousia or R. decussatus). This was consistent with decreased 13C-concentrations in the 0-0.5 cm sediment layer in the treatment with the two bivalves together. Contrary to C. tentaculata, no changes were observed among treatments in the 13C-uptake by P. foetida. This possibly reflected a limited 13C-enrichment of the lower sediment layers. Our main findings are: (1) A. senhousia reduces the 13C-uptake by R. decussatus, and (2) A. senhousia reduces the availability of phytoplankton-derived C for deposit feeders by impairing the feeding, incorporation and bio-deposition of R. decussatus. We conclude that the interaction of A. senhousia with native bivalves needs to be taken into consideration in future food web studies.},

We used the amount of dietary phosphorus (P) as a measure of food quality, because P is often a limiting resource in freshwater ecosystems. We compared the feeding rate and food preference of each snail species to food containing two levels of P. Because potential competitors can also affect foraging decisions, we conducted additional experiments comparing the effects of conspecifics and heterospecifics under low and high biomass. Consistent with predictions, both species increased feeding rate of low P food, and P. antipodarum consumed more food per unit mass than Fossaria. However, only Fossaria displayed a preference for high P food. The two snails also differed in their response to interacting snails. Fossaria significantly reduced foraging activity in the presence of both conspecifics and heterospecifics, while P. antipodarum spent more time feeding under high conspecific density. Although the presence of high densities of P. antipodarum may negatively impact Fossaria in its native habitat, Fossaria's ability to locate and preferentially feed on higher quality resources may mitigate some of the impact, potentially facilitating coexistence between these two species.},

title={The use of shellfish for eutrophication control},
abstract={Issue Title: Special Issue: European Aquaculture Development since 1993: The benefits of aquaculture to Europe and the perspectives of European aquaculture production Effects of excess loading of nutrients to the marine environment can be mitigated by mussel cultures, basically through nutrient removal from the marine environment when shellfish are harvested. Shellfish farming also provide other goods and services to the marine environment primarily through the impact on water transparency caused by shellfish filtration. There is an increasing awareness of the mitigation potential in mussel culture in relation to eutrophication, but so far practical examples of culture on full scale devoted to mitigation are few. Further, impact of mussel farming on nutrient cycling, e.g. in the sediments below the culture units, has raised concerns. In this review, we clarify concepts in relation to nutrient mitigation and discuss goods and services delivered by mussel mitigation cultures and their impact on an ecosystem scale based primarily on results from studies in heavily eutrofied estuaries. A multi-criteria approach for site selection is presented based on experiences from Danish waters, and economic aspects of mitigation cultures are analysed in relation to use of the produced mitigation mussels. Future perspectives for extractive cultures are discussed in relation to source of excess nutrients.},

title={Origin and introduction history of self-sustaining rainbow trout populations in Europe as inferred from mitochondrial DNA and a Y-linked marker},
abstract={Following its introduction in the late nineteenth century, rainbow trout gradually spread to become one of the most widespread non-native fishes. Nevertheless, despite continuous introductions, they have become self-sustaining in only a limited number of European rivers, most of which are located in the Prealps. There is no consensus on the reasons for the absence of self-sustaining populations over most of Europe, though genetic differences have been suggested as a potential underlying factor. We conducted a population genetic study of the structure and origin of European populations to help resolve these questions. We examined variation in mitochondrial D-loop and the Y-linked marker of 41 self-sustaining, stocked, and hatchery populations from Europe and compared them to native and hatchery populations in North America. High levels of genetic diversity but little inter-population genetic variation suggests that European populations are derived from multiple sources, with a great majority of parental populations belonging to steelhead and coastal rainbow trout from Central and Northern California. Our study revealed no considerable genetic differences among European self-sustaining, stocked, and hatchery populations. The mitochondrial DNA data do not allow evaluation of selection and adaptive traits and thus cannot explain potential population differences arising in their naturalization success.},

abstract={Benthic species associated with hard substrate are known to form communities characterized by high abundance and biomass. Although the bottom of the Southern Baltic Sea is dominated by soft sediments, such communities find favorable conditions to thrive on artificial substrates of offshore constructions. The aim of this research was to characterize both short-term and long-term benthic communities associated with artificial hard bottom provided by man-made structures in the Southern Baltic Sea. Species composition as well as the abundance and biomass were examined at various sites. An inactive World War II torpedo testing facility in the Gulf of Gdansk served as a site for sampling long-term communities while short-term communities were sampled using settlement panels and PVC cylinders. Panels were deployed at the torpedo testing facility for 127 days. PVC cylinders were deployed for 141-190 days in the Polish Exclusive Economic Zone. Twenty six macrofaunal taxa, including 12 crustaceans, were identified during the research. [Mytilus edulis] and [Amphibalanus improvisus] were the most abundant invertebrates at sampled surfaces. Six non-indigenous species were found. For the first time adult individuals of [Mytilopsis leucophaeata] were found in the Polish Marine Areas indicating that it is possible for this non-indigenous species to reproduce in this region.},

title={Is Dikerogammarus villosus (Crustacea, Gammaridae) a 'killer shrimp' in the River Rhine system?},
abstract={Communities and food web structures of aquatic ecosystems can be strongly affected by the establishment of alien macroinvertebrate species. In many European waters, the invasion of the Ponto-Caspian amphipod Dikerogammarus villosus has led to displacement of other macroinvertebrates. Predation by D. villosus is often assumed to be the key driver of the displacement based on results of laboratory studies, but this has not been verified in the field. Here, we report our investigation of the relevance of D. villosus predation in the River Rhine system using both stable isotope analyses of <ce><b4>^sup 13^C and <ce><b4>^sup 15^N, and molecular analyses of D. villosus gut contents with group-specific primers aiming at macroinvertebrate prey taxa. Stable isotope analyses of D. villosus from ten sites showed mean <ce><b4>^sup 15^N values comparable to those of primary consumers. Overall, only approximately 1% of all tested primer/gut content combinations revealed DNA of the respective taxa. Both indicate minor importance of predation by D. villosus as a driver of the observed macroinvertebrate displacement. Conceivably, competitive strength due to opportunistic feeding, indicated by different niche widths between and a strong intraspecific variation of <ce><b4>^sup 13^C values of D. villosus within sites of our study, is much more important for its invasion success.},

title={Bivalve Grazing Can Shape Phytoplankton Communities},
abstract={The ability of bivalve filter feeders to limit phytoplankton biomass in shallow waters is well-documented, but the role of bivalves in shaping phytoplankton communities is not. The coupled effect of bivalve grazing at the sediment-water interface and sinking of phytoplankton cells to that bottom filtration zone could influence the relative biomass of sinking (diatoms) and non-sinking phytoplankton. Simulations with a pseudo-2D numerical model showed that benthic filter feeding can interact with sinking to alter diatom:non-diatom ratios. Cases with the smallest proportion of diatom biomass were those with the fastest sinking speeds and strongest bivalve grazing rates. Hydrodynamics modulated the coupled sinking-grazing influence on phytoplankton communities. For example, in simulations with persistent stratification, the non-sinking forms accumulated in the surface layer away from bottom grazers while the sinking forms dropped out of the surface layer toward bottom grazers. Tidal-scale stratification also influenced vertical gradients of the two groups in opposite ways. The model was applied to Suisun Bay, a low-salinity habitat of the San Francisco Bay system that was transformed by the introduction of the exotic clam Potamocorbula amurensis. Simulation results for this Bay were similar to (but more muted than) those for generic habitats, indicating that P. amurensis grazing could have caused a disproportionate loss of diatoms after its introduction. Our model simulations suggest bivalve grazing affects both phytoplankton biomass and community composition in shallow waters. We view these results as hypotheses to be tested with experiments and more complex modeling approaches.},

abstract={Modern river ecosystems undergo constant stress from disturbances such as bank stabilization, channelization, dams, and municipal, agricultural, and industrial water use. As these anthropogenic water requirements persist, more efficient methods of characterizing river reaches are essential. Benthic macroinvertebrates are helpful when evaluating fluvial health, because they are often the first group to react to contaminants that can then be transferred through them to other trophic levels. Hence, the purpose of this research is to use a geospatial model to differentiate instream macroinvertebrate habitats, and determine if the model is a viable method for stream evaluation. Through the use of ArcGIS and digital elevation models, the fluvial geomorphology of the Qu<e2><80><99>Appelle River in Saskatchewan (SK) was assessed. Four geomorphological characteristics of the river were isolated (sinuosity, slope, fractal dimension, and stream width) and clustered through Principle Component Analysis (PCA), yielding sets of river reaches with similar geomorphological characteristics, called typologies. These typologies were mapped to form a geospatial model of the river. Macroinvertebrate data were aligned to the locations of the typologies, revealing several relationships with the fluvial geomorphology. A Kruskal-Wallis analysis and post hoc pairwise multiple comparisons were completed with the macroinvertebrate data to pinpoint significant genera, as related to the geospatial model.},

abstract={Niche breadth has fundamental ecological implications. Specialists with a narrow niche space are able to survive under specific conditions only, making them potentially sensitive to effects of environmental change. We here investigate (1) the factors restricting the specialized spring snail Bythinella dunkeri to its specific habitat, and (2) its capacity for plasticity to respond to changing environmental conditions, based on a combination of field work and laboratory experiments. By comparing occupied and unoccupied sites, we revealed that snail presence was most strongly affected by distance to the crop-out, water depth, pH value, and redox potential. In contrast, spring temperatures did not affect the occurrence of this 'stenothermic' snail, and laboratory experiments documented a high tolerance toward both high and fluctuating temperatures. However, B. dunkeri was found to be very sensitive to desiccation, such that changes in precipitation regimes may easily harm populations. The species investigated here may therefore indeed be sensitive to environmental change, but not because of limited thermal tolerance which initially seemed to be the most obvious reason.},

abstract={The increasingly frequent appearance of invasive species of mussels is a common phenomenon nowadays. Their rapid expansion is a significant component of the global changes that pose a great ecological impact and a serious threat to the diversity of native fauna. This study documents new localities of occurrence of Sinanodonta woodiana in Poland. We also attempted to determine its density, biomass, morphometric features and age structure. We found that its presence is clearly related to temperature and that the current range of its occurrence in Poland mostly overlaps with the areas with the highest average annual temperatures.

abstract={Inventories and population monitoring are essential activities supporting the conservation of freshwater mussel diversity in Canadian rivers. Despite widespread use of timed-search methods to survey river mussels, the relationship between species detection and search effort has received limited study. In this study, repeat-sampling data from 54 Ontario river sites were used to estimate: (1) species detection probabilities; (2) the number of sampling events required to confidently detect species; and, (3) the power of timed-search surveys to detect future distribution declines. Mussels were collected using visual and tactile methods, and collection data were recorded separately for each 1.5 h of search time (up to 4.5 h). Thirteen species were collected; including two endangered species (Rainbow Villosa iris and Eastern Pondmussel Ligumia nasuta). In all cases, species detection was imperfect. However, detection probabilities (p) for most species were high (>0.69). Two repeat 4.5 h surveys are required to confidently assess whether most (83%) species are present at a site. Search effort had a positive effect on estimates of species richness, detection probability and site occupancy, and the power to detect future distribution declines. At all levels of sampling effort, detection probability and site occupancy estimates were positively correlated to mussel abundance.

abstract={Juvenile habitat use and early life migratory behaviors of successfully recruited adult fish provide unique insight into critical habitats for a population, and this information allows restoration plans to be tailored to maximize benefits. Retrospective analysis of adult otolith chemistry combined with fish-otolith growth models were used to assess juvenile nursery habitat selection and size at egress to adult habitats (marine waters) for anadromous alewife and blueback herring from 20 rivers throughout the eastern US. Between-species differences in the size of emigrants were small, with blueback herring found in freshwater nurseries ~ 8 % more frequently than alewives, and alewives using a combination of freshwater and estuarine nurseries ~ 9 % more than bluebacks. Estuarine nursery use was more common in populations at lower latitudes. No clear trends in sizes of emigrants or habitat use were observed between the species in watersheds where both co-occur. Principal component analysis of latitude, watershed area, estuary area, accessible river kilometers, and percentage of the watershed in urban use indicated that the combined effects of these watershed characteristics were correlated with size at egress. These results highlight the considerable plasticity in early life habitat use among populations of anadromous fishes as well as the effect of watershed characteristics on early life migration timing and strategies.},

title={Low Food Availability Narrows the Tolerance of the Copepod Eurytemora affinis to Salinity, but Not to Temperature},
abstract={Invasive species perturb food webs, often decreasing resource availability for resident taxa. Low resource availability may interact with abiotic factors to restrict niches, particularly niche axes that influence metabolic demand. The San Francisco Estuary (SFE) provides a case study, as it has low phytoplankton concentrations, likely due to invasive bivalves. We conducted two laboratory experiments to examine how phytoplankton concentrations influence the salinity and temperature tolerance of Eurytemora affinis, an important prey taxon for threatened SFE fish. We found that decreased algal concentration narrowed the tolerance of E. affinis to salinity, but not to temperature. A third experiment revealed that when food concentration was relatively low (chlorophyll-a of 15 [mu]g L^sup -1^) and salinity was elevated (8 vs 4), E. affinis did not compensate for osmotic stress by increasing consumption, halving its growth rate. However, when algal concentration was elevated (chlorophyll-a 55 [mu]g L^sup -1^), E. affinis consumed three times more algae at a salinity of 8 vs 4, allowing copepods to grow equally at both salinities. Our interpretation is that while E. affinis can compensate for increased metabolic demand as temperature increases at low food concentrations, it can only compensate for elevated metabolic demand at hypo- or hyperosmotic salinities when food concentrations are high. We therefore propose the hypothesis that low food concentrations narrow the realized salinity, but not the realized thermal, niche of E. affinis.},

Early (1990-1995) studies in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron, demonstrated a shift from light to nutrient (phosphorus, P) limitation of benthic algae, and large changes in benthic algal community composition once zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) became established. We conducted benthic algal sampling and a nutrient enrichment experiment at a historic sampling site to quantify benthic algae under current environmental conditions and to compare current results with historical data. Benthic algal P-demand was apparently saturated immediately post-invasion, but in subsequent years, algal growth on artificial substrata was consistently P-limited (p always <0.005), perhaps as a result of declining mussel abundance. Epilithic benthic algal community composition displayed large interannual changes, perhaps in response to mussel-induced alteration of light availability and natural changes in substratum characteristics at this site.},

abstract={Issue Title: Topical Collection on Invasive Species: Guest Editors Elizabeta Briski and Farrah Chan (pp. 2447-2521) Invasive species are often more able to rapidly and efficiently utilise resources than natives, and comparing per capita resource use at different resource densities among invaders and trophically analogous natives could allow for reliable predictions of invasiveness. In South Africa, invasion by the Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis has transformed wave-exposed shores, negatively affecting native mussel species. Currently, South Africa is experiencing a second mussel invasion with the recent detection of the South American Semimytilus algosus. We tested per capita uptake of an algal resource by invading M. galloprovincialis, S. algosus, and the native Aulacomya atra at different algal concentrations and temperatures, representing the west and south coasts of South Africa, to examine whether their per capita resource use could be a predictor of their spread and subsequent invasiveness. Regardless of temperature, M. galloprovincialis was the most efficient consumer, significantly reducing algal cells compared to the other species when the resource was presented in both low and high starting densities. Furthermore, these findings aligned with a greater biomass of M. galloprovincialis on the shore in comparison with the other species. Resource use by the new invader S. algosus was dependent on the density of resource and, although this species was efficient at low algal concentrations at cooler temperatures, this pattern broke down at higher algal densities. This was once more reflected in lower biomass in surveys of this species along the cool west coast. We therefore forecast that S. algosus will be become established along the south coast; however, we also predict that M. galloprovincialis will maintain dominance on these shores.},

The comet assay allows the detection of DNA damage such as DNA strand breaks and alkali-labile sites. The main oxidative lesion, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG), which is a pre-mutagenic lesion, can be detected by the comet assay coupled with the hOGG1 DNA repair enzyme. With this modified assay we recently observed that BaP induced 8-oxodG lesions and with the modified comet-Fpg assay we observed that Cd induced oxidative DNA damage. The aim of this study was to determine the stability of DNA lesions in Cd and BaP exposed zebra mussels using the comet-hOGG1 assay. Mussels were exposed for 24 h to these two chemicals and then placed in clean water for 6 days. We observed that BaP (7, 12 and 18 <c2><b5>g/L) induced an increase of DNA strand break levels as soon as 6 h of exposure and that the two highest concentrations of BaP induced a low level of hOGG1-sensitive sites. After 2 days of depuration, BaP induced DNA lesions returned to the basal level, indicating an effective DNA repair. Cd (3, 32 and 81 <c2><b5>g/L) induced an increase of the DNA strand break levels and a low level of hOGG1-sensitive sites. This study revealed that BaP-induced DNA lesions are repaired more efficiently than Cd-induced DNA lesions. As the level of hOGG1 sensitive sites was increased in Cd and BaP exposed mussels, it seems that these chemicals induce 8-oxo-dG.},

abstract={Aim: Information on the influence of mussel macrofouling in invertebrate communities usually have the initial assumption of negative interference. Methods: We analyzed this relationship in a community of aquatic invertebrates associated to roots of Eichhornia crassipes in 15 shallow marginal lakes in the Pantanal National Park and surroundings. We sampled quadrants of floating vegetation, identified the aggregate fauna and evaluated the density effect of Limnoperna fortunei, as well as abiotic factors of the Trichoptera community using ordinances and multivariate regressions. Results: We found no significant relationship between the abundance of mussels on the macrophytes and the Trichoptera larvae. However, we observed an interference of oxygen on the structure and density of genera. The composition and abundance of the phytophylous caddisfly community is influenced by the depth and the concentration of oxygen dissolved in the marginal regions of the lakes. Conclusions: We suggest that the absence of the effects of the assessed L. fortunei in the community is related to the 'biotic resistance', in which the phytophylous caddisfly demonstrated adaptation to an environment characterized by hypoxic conditions in the dry season. L. fortunei was limited by the depth and reduction of oxygen, presenting lower density in lakes with such characteristics.},

abstract={Issue Title: THEMED SECTION: Ecology, Culture, and Management of Burbot Burbot (Lota lota) stomach content was analyzed from eastern Lake Michigan using 835 stomach samples collected from 1996 to 2012. Our results show alteration in the prey community consumed between the early study period (1996-2006) and the more recent period (2007-2012). In the early years, alewives (Alosa pseudoharengus), slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus), and mottled sculpin (C. bairdii) were the most important prey items, with regional variation suggesting greater use of Cottus spp. in the southern lake sites compared to northern sites where alewives were predominant. Non-native round gobies (Neogobius melanostomus) replaced Cottus spp. and alewives as the most frequently found prey item in the more recent years in the dataset, and other minor constituents of the prey assemblage nearly disappeared from the stomach samples. Round gobies first appeared in the diet in 1999 and became frequent by 2006, reaching 55.80% (<c2><b1>5.36) in 2012. The dominance of round goby as prey for burbot is important for the transfer of benthic nutrients into the upper food web in Lake Michigan. Our data highlight the striking food web shift linked to the non-native species invasion that has taken place in Lake Michigan since 2000 and emphasize its impact on native predator ecology.},

abstract={Given that phytoplankton and zooplankton communities have served as key ecological indicators of anthropogenic and other perturbations, a high-resolution Finite Volume Coastal Ocean Model (FVCOM) based Integrated Compartment Model (FVCOM-ICM) was implemented to investigate plankton dynamics with the inclusion of dreissenid invasion in Lake Erie, particularly in the most productive western basin. After identifying suitable horizontal and vertical resolutions that allowed for accurate depiction of in-lake nutrient concentrations and plankton biomass, we explored how variation in nutrient (phosphorus, nitrogen) loading and dreissenid mussel density could influence plankton dynamics. Our scenario-testing showed that western Lake Erie's phytoplankton community appeared more limited by phosphorus than nitrogen on both seasonal and interannual scales with light limitation occurring in the nearshore and Maumee River plume areas. Dreissenid mussel impacts varied temporally, with phytoplankton communities being highly influenced by dreissenid nutrient excretion at times (under low nutrient availability) and dreissenid grazing at other times (under bloom conditions). It was concluded that the effect of zooplankton predation on phytoplankton was stronger than that of dreissenid mussels, and that multiple algal groups could promote the efficiency of nutrient assimilation and the overall plankton production. Additionally, river inputs and wind-driven water circulation were important by causing heterogeneity in habitat conditions through nutrient advection and vertical mixing, and wind-induced surface waves could result in non-negligible down-wind redistribution of plankton biomass, which increased with wind/wave magnitude.

abstract={Before invasion, or in its early stages, information on the invader in target areas is generally extremely limited. In such situations, managers must select focal areas in which to concentrate control and mitigation efforts. Here, we discuss a rapid method for selecting areas in which to control invasive aquatic species based on limited information. We used a simple cellular automata model that does not require species-specific information, but simulates the process of invasive species expansion and includes observed expansion progress to detect keystone areas. As a case study, we simulated the expansion of an invasive aquatic mussel, Limnoperna fortunei, in Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan, and detected the areas in which control efforts should be concentrated. To some extent, our model was able to predict the expansion of L. fortunei from the initial detected invasion to the current distribution. We predicted areas with a high potential of spreading and areas that would suffer from high propagule pressure. Results revealed a mismatch between areas with high spread potential and those with high propagule pressure. Managers should concentrate their invasion prevention efforts in the former because these are likely to have a greater long-term influence. Additionally, we predicted future expansion from the current distribution and showed that current scattered populations could merge naturally. Our approach is useful for establishing a management plan before or in the early stages of invasion.},

abstract={Quantifying patterns of habitat use by riverine species is logistically challenging, yet instream habitat characteristics are likely important in explaining the distribution of species. We integrated radiotelemetry and sonar habitat mapping to quantify instream habitat use by female Barbour's Map Turtles (Graptemys barbouri) in Ichawaynochaway Creek, a tributary to the Flint River. We used logistic regression and a Bayesian information-theoretic approach to evaluate habitat use relative to habitat availability based on random locations. Over the two-year study period, turtles used an average of 839<c2><b1>199 m of creek length and exhibited site fidelity (mean 50% kernel density = 0.23+0.05 ha). Substrate was generally more predictive of habitat use of female C. barbouri compared to large woody debris and water depth. Turtles generally used deeper habitats close to rocky-boulder and rocky-fine substrate with greater amounts of large woody debris. Estimates of home range size and habitat use found in this study improve our understanding of the spatial ecology of C. barbouri and provide a baseline for their habitat use in a relatively undisturbed section of stream. It is imperative to understand the spatial ecology of species, such as map turtles, that are particularly vulnerable to indirect effects of habitat modifications caused by impoundments, sedimentation, pollution, and snagging.},

abstract={Issue Title: Special Feature on Individual-level niche specialization Among-individual diet variation is common in natural populations and may occur at any trophic level within a food web. Yet, little is known about its variation among trophic levels and how such variation could affect phenotypic divergence within populations. In this study we investigate the relationships between trophic position (the population's range and average) and among-individual diet variation. We test for diet variation among individuals and across size classes of Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis), a widespread predatory freshwater fish that undergoes ontogenetic niche shifts. Second, we investigate among-individual diet variation within fish and invertebrate populations in two different lake communities using stable isotopes. Third, we test potential evolutionary implications of population trophic position by assessing the relationship between the proportion of piscivorous perch (populations of higher trophic position) and the degree of phenotypic divergence between littoral and pelagic perch sub-populations. We show that among-individual diet variation is highest at intermediate trophic positions, and that this high degree of among-individual variation likely causes an increase in the range of trophic positions among individuals. We also found that phenotypic divergence was negatively related to trophic position in a population. This study thus shows that trophic position is related to and may be important for among-individual diet variation as well as to phenotypic divergence within populations.},

abstract={Issue Title: Special Feature on Individual-level niche specialization Common buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica L.) is one of the most abundant and ecologically harmful non-native plants in forests of the Upper Midwest United States. At the same time, European earthworms are invading previously glaciated areas in this region, with largely anecdotal evidence suggesting they compound the negative effects of buckthorn and influence the invasibility of these forests. Germination and seedling establishment are important control points for colonization by any species, and manipulation of the conditions influencing these life history stages may provide insight into why invasive species are successful in some environments and not others. Using a greenhouse microcosm experiment, we examined the effects of important biotic and abiotic factors on the germination and seedling establishment of common buckthorn. We manipulated light levels, leaf litter depth and earthworm presence to investigate the independent and interactive effects of these treatments on buckthorn establishment. We found that light and leaf litter depth were significant predictors of buckthorn germination but that the presence of earthworms was the most important factor; earthworms interacted with light and leaf litter to increase the number and biomass of buckthorn across all treatments. Path analysis suggested both direct and moisture-mediated indirect mechanisms controlled these processes. The results suggest that the action of earthworms may provide a pathway through which buckthorn invades forests of the Upper Midwest United States. Hence, researchers and managers should consider co-invasion of plants and earthworms when investigating invasibility and creating preemptive or post-invasion management plans.},

abstract={Issue Title: Emerging Trends in Aquatic Ecology Invasion of non-indigenous species (NIS) is acknowledged as one of the most important external drivers affecting structure and functions of marine ecosystems globally. This paper offers literature-based analysis on the effects of the widespread (occurring in at least 50% of countries) and currently established NIS on ecosystem features in the Baltic Sea. It appears that out of the 18 NIS taxa studied, there are no published records on 28% of NIS for any of the seven impact categories investigated. When ecological impacts are known, laboratory experimental evidence dominates over field studies. Combined observations on impact strength, information type and confidence level suggest that the two benthic invertebrates, the polychaete Marenzelleria spp. and the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas 1771) exert the highest ecosystem impact. Despite continuously accumulating information on the NIS effects, however, the confidence of findings is still low. Thus, we still understand very little on both the direction and magnitude of the effects of even the most widespread NIS on the structure and dynamics of the Baltic Sea ecosystems. In order to increase reliability of such assessments, future research should be targeted towards spatially-explicit field surveys and experimenting of multitrophic systems, together with modelling of ecosystem impact.},

abstract={In recent years, the use of biochemical markers, especially in the assessment of toxic effects and modes of action, under controlled laboratory conditions has increased. However, transposing their use to in situ monitoring or risk assessment evaluations has encountered barriers, mainly related to the difficulty in interpreting the meaning of biochemical variation. In this work, we aimed at understanding if biochemical marker activities (cholinesterase, glutathione S-transferase and lactate dehydrogenase) can be used to monitor the health status of natural populations of fish (Gambusia affinis) and daphnids (Daphnia magna). For that, two ponds with different water properties were chosen as study sites, and organisms collected at four sampling periods along the year. The pattern of biochemical marker responses was not the same in the two species, showing higher integrated biochemical marker response values in the winter for G. affinis and in the autumn for D. magna, suggesting specificities that must be taken into account in biomonitoring programmes by including representative species of several trophic levels. In the case of G. affinis, the differences in key physicochemical parameters between the two ponds (especially dissolved oxygen levels) did not seem to affect biochemical marker levels as if organisms were already perfectly adapted to their environment. In general, seasonal variation of water quality seems to have an important role on biochemical marker responses. Several parameters above Environmental Quality Standards were identified such as dissolved oxygen (DO), ammonia, nitrites, sulphides and metals, but eventual responses to these stressors could not be discriminated from natural variation except for particular cases.},

abstract={Issue Title: Aquatic Invasive Species We summarize current knowledge on the effects of the invasive Asian bivalve Limnoperna fortunei (introduced in South America around 1990) on local biota. Limnoperna modifies nutrient concentrations and decreases concentrations of particulate organic matter in the water column (including phytoplankton and zooplankton), thus enhancing light penetration and stimulating growth of periphyton and macrophytes. Selective grazing and modification of the N:P ratio are responsible for strong enhancements of toxic cyanobacterial blooms. Limnoperna beds significantly enhance the numbers, biomass, and diversity of practically all accompanying invertebrates. The mussel's planktonic larvae represent an important food item for the larvae of 18 fish species, while juveniles and adults are consumed by at least 50 fish species. Limnoperna is the first and only abundant benthic filter-feeding animal in South American continental waters. The fact that it intercepts and retains in the freshwater lotic domain particulate organic matter that would otherwise be swept into the sea must represent an important energetic subsidy, but the ecosystem-wide consequences of this trophic shift have not yet been addressed. Comparison with the impacts of the zebra mussel in Europe and North America suggests important differences.},

title={Ecological mechanisms of invasion success in aquatic macrophytes},
abstract={Issue Title: Aquatic Invasive Species Aquatic plants (macrophytes) are important components of freshwater ecosystems and serve numerous purposes that structure aquatic communities. Although macrophytes represent an essential component of stable aquatic communities, invasive macrophytes negatively alter ecosystem properties. Non-native, invasive species have been identified as a major cause of biodiversity loss and the increasing prevalence of invasive species has prompted studies to help understand their impacts and to conserve biodiversity. Studying mechanisms of invasion also give insight into how communities are structured and assembled. This paper examined mechanisms that contribute to macrophyte invasion through a literature review. Mechanisms identified with this review included competition, enemy release, evolution of increased competitive ability, mutualisms, invasional meltdown, novel weapons, allelopathy, phenotypic plasticity, naturalization of related species, empty niche, fluctuating resources, opportunity windows, and propagule pressure; and were then placed within the context of the invasion process. Results of this review indicated that many invasion mechanisms have been tested with fully aquatic macrophytes with varied levels of support (i.e., some mechanisms are not supported by evidence in the context of macrophyte invasions). Future research should continue the search for evidence of invasion mechanisms that allow introduced species to establish. It is likely that general principles governing these invasions do not exist, at least among comparisons across ecosystem types. However, ecologists should continue to search for general patterns within definable ecosystem units to increase understanding about factors contributing to invasibility.},

Species invasions are occurring at an unprecedented scale, yet few centrally organized distributional databases can accurately display location information used to prioritize management efforts within a watershed, region, or political boundary. For particularly harmful groups of invaders such as some freshwater invertebrates, one consequence is that predictive power is limited because current invasion patterns are unknown. We used the Nonindigenous Aquatic Species database of the US Geological Survey to determine current hotspots of invertebrate invasion in the US and compared those patterns with better-documented fish invasions. Invasive freshwater invertebrates were densely clustered in the Laurentian Great Lakes region compared to invasive fish that were concentrated in Florida and the Southwest. However, temporal patterns of fish and invertebrate invasions did not significantly differ. Ballast water was the most important source of invertebrate introductions, whereas fish were more often introduced by stocking, aquaculture, and aquarium release. A centralized database of current species distributions, ideally at the global scale, would greatly inform prevention and mitigation efforts for harmful species invasions.},

abstract={Issue Title: Aquatic Invasive Species Introduced host species are often characterised by reduced parasite numbers compared to their native populations. Any such advantage gained from parasite release following introduction into a new area may often diminish over a short period as the new host gradually acquires local parasites. In this study, the metazoan parasite communities of four goby species (Proterorhinus semilunaris, Ponticola kessleri, Neogobius melanostomus, and Neogobius fluviatilis) recently introduced into the lower River Rhine were investigated. Mean parasite abundance and infracommunity richness were positively associated with time since host introduction, both parasite variables being the highest in P. semilunaris. In Ponticola and Neogobius species, parasite species richness and the dominance of larval parasites in the Lower Rhine were similar to that for non-native populations in the middle Danube. Sporadic local parasite acquisition and infection, predominantly by species commonly found in the native range, led to a relatively high qualitative similarity in parasite communities between hosts. The relationship between parasite abundance and fish size reflected size-dependant food selectivity and/or parasite accumulation throughout the host's life. Data from this study emphasise the importance of duration of co-occurrence, host habitat and foraging preference, as well as the co-introduction of suitable intermediate hosts, for parasite community composition in related species.},

Legislation, literature, and scientific research dealing with plant invasions in inland waters often merge different types of invasive plant species and invaded habitats, as there are some overlappings between the concepts of macrophyte, aquatic plants, inland waters, wetlands, and riparian habitats. Freshwater ecosystems may well be the most endangered ecosystems in the world. Countless aquatic plants have been introduced in Europe and in the Mediterranean region, either deliberately because they were thought to be ornamental or otherwise desirable, or accidentally as releases from aquaria, dumping from water gardens, or contaminants. The escape of alien plants from managed environments is also frequent. Aquatic invaders have strong negative impacts on native biodiversity and many different impacts are reported in the literature for Europe and worldwide. Plant invasions in inland waters may be considered as one of a syndrome of factors that characterize degraded aquatic ecosystems. There are a number of risk analysis, impact assessment, ranking systems, decision trees, and prioritization methods available throughout Europe and the EPPO region, but the lack of a common framework for assessing the risks posed by invasive alien aquatic species is seen as a key gap. Successful management should include prevention, habitat restoration, dedicated risk assessment, prioritization, awareness raising, dedicated legislation, collaboration between different stakeholders, development of codes of conduct with the horticultural sector, and prohibiting the sale, purchase, and intentional release of some species in the wild. Actions to protect the European and Mediterranean inland waters from plants invasions are urgently needed and could provide overarching benefits.},

abstract={Issue Title: Aquatic Invasive Species Modeling of invasive species' potential distributions is critical for preventing new invasions. Distribution models use environmental characteristics of observed distributions to determine the suite of conditions that allows invasion. Some variables are directly related to species' biological needs, while others are surrogates that do not directly influence distributions. For aquatic invasive species (AIS) with calcified shells and exoskeletons, one common limiting factor is the chemical restriction on forming calcium carbonate (CaCO3), which is usually represented by conductivity or dissolved calcium. We predicted that conductivity and calcium would not serve as accurate surrogates for CaCO3 saturation state, which is more directly linked to calcification potential. To test this prediction, we fit classification trees to field surveys of northern Wisconsin lakes for three calcifying AIS--rusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus), banded mystery snail (Viviparus georgianus), and Chinese mystery snail (Cipanguladina chinensis). Along with lake area, variables associated with calcification were the best predictors of species distributions. Even though saturation state is the most biologically mechanistic variable, it did not improve model predictions or explain more variability in species presence than its surrogates. Overall, surrogates are sufficient for species distribution modeling in these lakes that exhibit a wide range of chemical states.},

abstract={In many coastal areas substrate is the limiting resource for benthic organisms. Some sessile species can be used as secondary substrate, reducing competition and increasing coexistence. In southern Chile, annual populations of Macrocystis pyrifera recruit and grow on the shells of Crepipatella fecunda. This study describes ecological interactions between the kelp and the slipper limpet over an annual cycle. The degree of kelp overgrowth was established by collecting sporophytes and through in situ submarine photography over a 10 month period (starting when kelp recruits became visible and ending when sporophytes were no longer present). Changes in the biochemical composition of the limpet tissue were also recorded by chemical analyses, to evaluate the potential effects (positive/neutral/negative) of kelp on C. fecunda nutritional condition. The results indicate that both species coexist, although kelp overgrowth may cause a decrease in carbohydrates in C. fecunda tissues, restricted to the period when the kelp forest reaches its maximum biomass. Individually, the short duration of the maximum overgrowth period and the size reached by C. fecunda females (up to 65 mm shell length) may enable rapid limpet recovery, avoiding competitive exclusion. On a population level, the M. pyrifera annual cycle generates the needed 'break' for C. fecunda populations, reducing the effects of kelp overgrowth. Thus, in the view of the neutral effect of kelp overgrowth, together with the positive effect of C. fecunda on M. pyrifera recruitment described somewhere else, this ecological interaction can be categorized as commensalism.},

Both cpDNA and microsatellite data revealed comparable genetic diversity and population differentiation between the native and introduced regions, which is consistent with the deliberate historical planting of heterogeneous founding groups in China. Bayesian clustering analysis showed that the best two clusters in the introduced region correspond to populations from the Atlantic coast and Gulf coast, respectively, instead of the three ecotypes proposed by a previous study. Investigating genetic composition of individuals suggested that most of the non-native plants might be of Atlantic origin, while some individuals in the Hong Kong population could be genetic admixtures of Atlantic and Gulf origin.

This study tested for territorial aggression of native three spot damselfish (Stegastes planifrons) toward invasive lionfish as a possible source of biotic resistance that may provide prey refugia for coral-reef fish recruits. Throughout July and August 2011, I conducted a field experiment in the Bahamas and the Cayman Islands using a model-bottle design specifically developed for examining three spot damselfish behavior. I compared the behavioral response of 40 damselfish to the presence of invasive lionfish and three native fishes presented individually in clear bottles, as well as to an empty bottle control. Despite lionfish having invaded these islands in different years, damselfish response did not differ between the Bahamas and the Cayman Islands. Overall, damselfish response toward invasive lionfish was not significantly different from the minimal response toward the empty bottle control. In contrast, damselfish actively responded to all native fishes, with species-specific behaviors and levels of aggression that depended on the ecological relationships between damselfish and intruding fishes. Differences in the seafloor rugosity of damselfish territories among study sites also appeared to influence damselfish response. The lack of damselfish response towards lionfish demonstrates that territories are unlikely to serve as native prey refugia, and may indicate lack of recognition of this invasive predator compared to native predators.},

title={Non-native gobies facilitate the transmission of Bucephalus polymorphus (Trematoda)},
abstract={Background Introduced species can modify local host-parasite dynamics by amplifying parasite infection which can 'spill-back' to the native fauna, whether they are competent hosts for local parasites, or by acting as parasite sinks with 'dilution' of infection decreasing the parasite burden of native hosts. Recently infection by the trematode Bucephalus polymorphus has increased in several European rivers, being attributed to the introduction of intermediate host species from the Ponto-Caspian region. Using a combination of field and experimental data, we evaluated the competence of non-native and native fish as intermediate hosts for B. polymorphus and its role for parasite development in a definitive host. Methods The density of 0+ juvenile fish (the second intermediate hosts for B. polymorphus) was measured in the River Morava, Czech Republic and fish were screened for natural metacercariae infection. The stomach contents of predatory fish that are definitive hosts of B. polymorphus were examined to assess the importance of non-native gobies for parasite transmission. In semi-natural conditions, parasite establishment, initial survival, and maturity rates in experimentally infected definitive hosts pikeperch Sander lucioperca were measured in flukes recovered from native white bream Abramis bjoerkna and non-native tubenose goby Proterorhinus semilunaris and round goby Neogobius melanostomus. Adult fluke size and egg production was also measured to evaluate the potential effect of intermediate host species on parasite fitness. Results We detected high natural infection parameters of B. polymorphus in native cyprinids and non-native gobies compared to data from the period prior to goby establishment. Both fish groups are consumed by predatory fish and represent a major component of the littoral fish community. Parasite establishment and adult size in definitive hosts was equivalent among the second intermediate host species, despite a lower size of metacercariae recovered from round gobies. However, development in the definitive host of flukes recovered from gobies was reduced, showing higher mortality, delayed maturity and lower egg production, in comparison with parasites from native hosts. Conclusions Substantial 'spill-back' of B. polymorphus due to higher transmission rates after establishment of non-native gobies was partially buffered by decreased fitness of B. polymorphus that underwent development in gobies.},

title={Trophic interaction between topmouth gudgeon (<i>Pseudorasbora parva</i>) and the co-occurring species during summer in the Dniprodzerzhynsk reservoir},
abstract={Topmouth gudgeon, Pseudorasbora parva is the most common invasive fish in Europe, which can compete with the juveniles of valuable commercial fishes. The goal of this work is to study the diet of topmouth gudgeon and trophic relationships with some native fishes inhabiting the littoral zone of the Dniprodzerzhynsk reservoir. The obtained relatively low values of diet overlaps between topmouth gudgeon and other co-occurring cyprinids such as juvenile roach, Rutilus rutilus; silver bream, Blicca bjoerkna; rudd, Scardinius erythrophthalmus; Prussian carp, Carassius gibelio and bleak, Abramis brama, indicate that it is not a serious food competitor for them, especially commercially valuable ones. On the contrary, high diet overlaps were observed among some native cyprinids such as juvenile roach, silver bream, rudd, and bleak. The major prey items of topmouth gudgeon were Chydorus sphaericus and chironomids, whereas other cyprinids selected Bosmina spp. This peculiarity may be due to different vertical distributions of these fish in the littoral zone of the reservoir, where topmouth gudgeon inhabit near-bottom water layers, where they preyed on near-bottom and benthic zooplankters and chironomids, while juvenile roach, silver bream, rudd, and juvenile and adult bleak live in higher water layers, where they preyed on pelagic zooplankton.Alternate abstract:Le Pseudorasbora, Pseudorasbora parva, est le poisson le plus envahissant en Europe, qui peut entrer en comp<c3><a9>tition avec les juv<c3><a9>niles de poissons de valeur commerciale localement.

abstract={Sagartia ornata is an alien anemone that occurs intertidally within the West Coast National Park (WCNP). The present study aimed to determine the current status and distribution of this anemone, to assess its diet so as to establish the role it may play as predator and to investigate its impact on sandy-shore communities. Sagartia ornata was found to be restricted to the WCNP, where it occurred in densities of up to 508 <c2><b1> 218 individuals per m^sup 2^. Populations were recorded in Nanozostera capensis seagrass beds for the first time and this alien was absent from two areas in which it had previously occurred. It is concluded that whilst this anemone negatively affects native biota, its current dependence on restricted habitats precludes widespread impacts with the park. With regard to conservation implications, this invasion should be routinely monitored outside the WCNP as in its native range S. ornata occurs on rocky shores and kelp holdfasts, suggesting a potential for spread along the west coast of South Africa.},

abstract={Florida apple snails (Pomacea paludosa) are critical to Florida wetland food webs. Past studies emphasized that large predators consumed relatively large specimens (> 20 mm shells) of these snails. Past studies also identified crayfish, fish, and turtles as predators of hatchling ([asymptotically =]3-6 mm) and juvenile-sized apple snails, but quantitative relationships between these predators and a range of sizes of apple snails are scant. We identified predators not yet reported in the literature: the Seminole killifish (Fundulus seminolis), bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), greater siren (Siren lacertina), and non-indigenous Mayan cichlid (Cichlasoma urophthalmus). We quantified the relationship between predator size and maximum snail size consumed for the following predators: crayfish (Procambarus alleni), turtles (Kinosternon bauri and Sternotherus odoratus), and redear sunfish (Lepomis microlophus). Predator size explained 60% to 78% of the variation in prey size eaten (which ranged from 4 to 22 mm shell length). When offered multiple sizes of prey simultaneously, crayfish and turtles ate snails smaller than the maximum size they were capable of consuming. All size classes of apple snails could fall prey to a variety of predators common to Florida wetlands. Understanding apple snail population ecology requires additional studies to quantify predation impacts on juvenile snails from aquatic predators.},

abstract={Despite massive population declines in the open waters of Lake St. Clair due to invasive dreissenid mussels, the St. Clair River Delta has persisted as a refuge habitat for native unionid mussels. This study was conducted to determine how Dreissena-induced population declines might have impacted the genetic population structure of native unionid species. Nine variable microsatellite markers were used to assess the genetic population structure of the Fatmucket mussel (Lampsilis siliquoidea) across 18 sites (n = 341 individuals) within the delta and four of its tributaries. Results indicate that Fatmuckets within the various bays of the St. Clair Delta and tributaries show limited genetic differentiation by geographic distance but still represent a single population with evidence of recent gene flow, little differentiation among sampling sites, relatively high allelic richness at all sites, and little evidence supporting a recent genetic bottleneck. The Fatmucket is the most common species found in the delta and poor genetic health and connectivity of this species might have indicated a dire situation for less common and imperiled species found in the same habitats. Because this did not appear to be the case, little can be assumed about other mussel species.},

title={3D modelling of dreissenid mussel impacts on phytoplankton in a large lake supports the nearshore shunt hypothesis and the importance of wind-driven hydrodynamics},
abstract={A three-dimensional hydrodynamic model (ELCOM) coupled with a biological model (CAEDYM) was calibrated with field data from Lake Simcoe (2008) and used to examine the expected impact of dreissenid mussels on the distribution of phytoplankton and nutrients, mussel energetic, and the interactions with hydrodynamic conditions. In accordance with the near-shore shunt hypothesis and the actual distribution of mussels, the model predicted a considerable impact of mussels on phytoplankton in nearshore areas (<15 m depth; -38 % phytoplankton). Horizontal advection could account for the lower (-15 % phytoplankton) offshore impact despite the absence of mussels within this region of the lake. These predictions were similar to observed long-term changes in phytoplankton biomass after the dreissenid mussel invasion. Simulated decreases in the initial mussel biomass by 50 % led to increased phytoplankton nearshore, increased mussel growth and decreased phosphorus excretion relative to ingestion. In contrast, increases in initial mussel biomass by 50 % resulted in minor changes in phytoplankton, since near-bottom depletion of phytoplankton caused growth and energy-limitation of mussels. The model, which was the first to capture metabolically-driven variations of mussel-mediated nutrient cycling, predicted a partial uncoupling of carbon and phosphorus cycling by mussels, driven by varying controls on mussel growth. A 60 % increase in the intensity of three storms during the summer had little net-effect on phytoplankton biomass, but reduced energy-limitation of mussels and increased mussel growth due to increased supply of phytoplankton. Our model demonstrates that near-bottom depletion of phytoplankton is an important process limiting the impact of mussels, and indicates that it affects the mussels' cycling of energy and nutrients. It further suggests that stronger storm events could lead to further increase of flux of organic matter from the pelagic zone to the benthos, further altering energy pathways in the lake.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Side-scan sonar is a valuable tool for mapping habitat features in many aquatic systems suggesting it may also be useful for locating sedentary biota. The objective of this study was to determine if side-scan sonar could be used to identify freshwater mussel (unionid) beds and the required environmental conditions. We used side-scan sonar to develop a series of mussel-bed reference images by placing mussel shells within homogenous areas of fine and coarse substrates. We then used side-scan sonar to map a 32-km river reach during spring and summer. Using our mussel-bed reference images, several river locations were identified where mussel beds appeared to exist in the scanned images and we chose a subset of sites (n = 17) for field validation. The validation confirmed that ~60% of the sites had mussel beds and ~80% had some mussels or shells present. Water depth was significantly related to our ability to predict mussel-bed locations: predictive ability was greatest at depths of 1-2 m, but decreased in water >2-m deep. We determined side-scan sonar is an effective tool for preliminary assessments of mussel presence during times when they are located at or above the substrate surface and in relatively fine substrates excluding fine silt.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={This study investigates whether ecosystem alteration occurred in a shallow, lowland lake following establishment of the alien zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas). Measurements of total phosphorus (TP) loads, lake TP concentrations, phytoplankton (chlorophyll a) and transparency levels for the period 1990-2008 were examined to determine the water quality effects of D. polymorpha. The period of time also included the implementation of catchment measures aimed at reducing phosphorus (P) loading to the lake. A range of loading-response models was tested to explore changes in the net sedimentation rate for P. Results show that while high TP loads from the catchment were reduced, TP concentrations in the lake remained high after D. polymorpha invasion. Decoupling of the previous chlorophyll a-TP relationship also occurred. Results from a TP loading-response model that closely simulated observed concentrations in the lake prior to establishment of D. polymorpha indicated that measured TP post establishment was statistically higher than predicted for the same conditions but without the presence of D. polymorpha. Data presented in the paper highlight the need to consider the potential impacts of invasive species in evaluations of the effectiveness of measures aimed at mitigating aquatic pollution.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Issue Title: Challenges in Aquatic Sciences Mytilopsis sallei is a small marine bivalve and is considered as a serious pest. We assume that the invasive bivalve M. sallei changed the community structure of fouling macrofauna and reduced the species diversity index in Yundang Lagoon, Xiamen, China. In order to verify the above hypothesis, test panels were submerged seasonally at five stations during four seasons in Yundang Lagoon, and some chemical parameters were determined. The results showed there were significant differences in density and biomass of M. sallei and other fouling macrofauna with season and with station. The species diversity of the macrofaunal fouling community at stations B and F was low in summer, because high density of M. sallei was found at two stations. There were significantly positive correlations between density and biomass of M. sallei and water temperature and COD, and significantly negative correlations with pH. The results confirmed that this invasive species changed the density and biomass compositions of fouling macrofauna, reduced the species diversity index during the summer period, and somewhat worsened the aquatic environmental quality in Yundang Lagoon, because the pH and the DO were the lowest, and the BOD and the COD were the second lowest in summer among four seasons.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={With the maturation and certification of several ballast water management systems that employ chlorine as biocide to prevent the spread of invasive species, there is a clear need for accurate and reliable total residual oxidants (TRO) technology to monitor treatment dose and assure the environmental safety of treated water discharged from ships. In this study, instruments used to measure TRO in wastewater and drinking water applications were evaluated for their performance in scenarios mimicking a ballast water treatment application (e.g., diverse hold times, temperatures, and salinities). Parameters chosen for testing these technologies in the past do not reflect conditions expected during ballast water treatment. Salinity, temperature, and oxidant concentration all influenced the response of amperometric sensors. Oxidation reduction potential (ORP) sensors performed more consistently than amperometric sensors under different conditions but it may be difficult to correlate ORP and TRO measurements for the multitude of biogeochemical conditions found naturally in ballast water. N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine (DPD) analyzers and amperometric sensors were also tested under intermittent sampling conditions mimicking a ballasting scenario, with cyclical dosage and discharge operations. When sampling was intermittent, amperometric sensors required excessive response and conditioning times, whereas DPD analyzers provided reasonable estimates of TRO under the ballasting scenario.},

abstract={Issue Title: Special Section: Coastal Lagoons and Estuaries in Mexico: Processes and Vulnerability. Guest Editors: Victor F. Camacho-Ibar and Victor H. Rivera-Monroy Alaska is at the northern end of an apparent latitudinal trend of decreasing coastal marine introductions on the West Coast of North America. Historical propagule supply may have played a role in forming this trend, but few studies have evaluated propagule supply to northern latitudes. Here, we examined the role of small boat traffic as a mechanism of long-distance spread for nonindigenous species (NIS) into coastal Alaska. We used a combination of public records, marina surveys, and boater interviews to characterize vessel traffic patterns and boater behaviors. In-water SCUBA sampling of recently arrived transient boats provided data on extent, richness, composition, and biogeography of biofouling incursions to Alaska from outside of the state. We documented a striking seasonality and directionality of vessel traffic, and most vessels were on voyages of >900 km. Most transient vessels sampled had few organisms, although one third had >100 organisms on submerged surfaces. Several NIS were recorded, including two that are not known to be established in Alaska (Watersipora subtorquata and Amphibalanus improvisus). The seasonal northward pulse of vessels and their cumulative biofouling species represent an important incursion mechanism for species yet to establish at the northern edge of a marine bioinvasion front in the northeastern Pacific. The low numbers of NIS sampled in this study coincide with the low number of marine NIS known from Alaska, which suggests that an opportunity remains to promote awareness and management of the vector to limit NIS influx to the region. This may be particularly relevant for future scenarios of increased vessel traffic and ocean warming, which are likely to interact to increase establishment success of invaders from the south.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Environmental factors affecting behavioural responses of an invasive bivalve to conspecific alarm cues},
abstract={Antipredator defences of aquatic animals depend on various environmental parameters. We studied behavioural responses of a Ponto-Caspian invasive bivalve, the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, to conspecific alarm cues. We hypothesized that mussels would change their locomotion and aggregation in response to alarm signals. We also hypothesized that body size, light, substratum quality (suitable or unsuitable for attachment) and inclination would affect mussel defences. Changes in horizontal movement of mussels exposed to the alarm substance depended on light. In the presence of crushed conspecifics illuminated mussels (all sizes) moved longer distances than control individuals, whereas in darkness their reaction was the opposite. The response of small mussels was the strongest. Furthermore, the alarm substance reduced upward relocations of all size groups on an inclined surface but at the same time stimulated their downward movement. Large and medium mussels (but not small individuals) exposed to alarm signals formed aggregations more often than control individuals. This effect was only exhibited on sand, unsuitable for mussel attachment. Mussels were generally more clumped on sand than on hard substratum, suggesting that they did not prefer conspecific shells as attachment sites when alternative substrata were available. All responses of mussels to alarm cues tended to be stronger in light, which is an indirect indication of danger. Our study shows that the responses of the zebra mussel to conspecific alarm cues are not limited to activity reduction, as previously thought. They are adjusted to particular environmental conditions and may also involve increased locomotion when relocation to a safer site gives a better chance of survival.

abstract={Ballast water has been a topic of concern for some time because of its potential to introduce invasive species to new habitats. To comply with the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments, members of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) must equip their ships with on-board treatment systems to eliminate organism release with ballast water. There are many challenges associated with the implementation of this IMO guideline, one of which is the selection of species for testing the ecological impacts of the treated ballast water. In the United States, ballast water toxicity test methods have been defined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. However, the test methods had not been finalized in China until the toxicity test methods for ballast water were established in 2008. The Chinese methods have been based on species from three trophic levels: Skeletonema costatum, Neomysis awatschensis, and Ctenogobius gymnauchen. All three species live in broad estuarine and open sea areas of China; they are sensitive to reference toxicants and acclimatize easily to different conditions. In this paper, the biological characteristics, test processes and statistical analysis methods are presented for the three species. Results indicate that the methods for evaluating these three organisms can be included in the ecological toxicity tests for treated ballast water in China.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Magnitude and Patterns of Change in Submerged Aquatic Vegetation of the Tidal Freshwater Hudson River},
abstract={Three aerial photography inventories were used to examine change in submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) in the tidal freshwater Hudson River over the interval 1997 to 2007. Overall, there was about a 30 % net decline in SAV coverage although there were also many individual areas of expansion. The invasive water chestnut (Trapa natans) did not change appreciably in net cover over the interval, and there was replacement of SAV by water chestnut along with slightly fewer cases of SAV replacing the exotic. A fine-scale (100 m by 100 m quadrats) analysis showed that about 30 % of quadrats that supported vegetation changed by more than 10 % in plant cover and overall SAV was quite dynamic. SAV in the Hudson is limited by light which is in turn controlled by suspended sediment. SAV was rarely found at depths >1 m below low water, and interannual differences in clarity affected the ability of SAV beds to maintain locally supersaturated levels of dissolved oxygen. We found that location within the River channel (proximity to shore) influenced the magnitude and variability in change in SAV between census periods. The physical nature of the adjacent shoreline also affected the magnitude of change with greater declines in cover in areas next to hard-engineered shore types. SAV in the Hudson is highly dynamic, apparently quite resilient, and the control of light by suspended sediment rather than phytoplankton growth offers a contrast to eutrophication-influenced changes in other estuaries. Management and protection of SAV habitat must recognize the highly variable nature of plant cover and that absence in any particular year does not preclude future appearance of submerged plants at that location.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={We estimated the influence of planktonic and benthic grazing on phytoplankton in the strongly tidal, river-dominated northern San Francisco Estuary using data from an intensive study of the low salinity foodweb in 2006-2008 supplemented with long-term monitoring data. A drop in chlorophyll concentration in 1987 had previously been linked to grazing by the introduced clam Potamocorbula amurensis, but numerous changes in the estuary may be linked to the continued low chlorophyll. We asked whether phytoplankton continued to be suppressed by grazing and what proportion of the grazing was by benthic bivalves. A mass balance of phytoplankton biomass included estimates of primary production and grazing by microzooplankton, mesozooplankton, and clams. Grazing persistently exceeded net phytoplankton growth especially for larger cells, and grazing by microzooplankton often exceeded that by clams. A subsidy of phytoplankton from other regions roughly balanced the excess of grazing over growth. Thus, the influence of bivalve grazing on phytoplankton biomass can be understood only in the context of limits on phytoplankton growth, total grazing, and transport.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={An increasing number of examples suggest that interactions among introduced species are ecologically important and relevant to the management of invaded systems. We investigated the potential for the introduced cephalaspidean sea slug Philine orientalis to interfere with the feeding of the introduced European green crab (Carcinus maenas) and the native Dungeness crab (Cancer magister). We observed co-occurrence of crab species and P. orientalis at field sites in Bodega Harbor and Tomales, San Pablo, and San Francisco Bays. In laboratory and field experiments, we determined whether crab feeding was suppressed by P. orientalis and the duration of this suppression for individual crabs. We also used foraging response models to explore changes in the feeding rate of crabs with varying densities of P. orientalis and small bivalve prey. We found that P. orientalis deterred predation by green and Dungeness crabs on small clams in laboratory feeding trials, but not in field experiments with green crabs and P. orientalis. Foraging models predicted that P. orientalis would only affect crab feeding in the field under specific conditions of crab, P. orientalis, and prey densities. These foraging models bridged an important gap between lab and field experiments and allowed us to predict how changes in species abundances at two trophic levels might alter the importance of crab suppression by P. orientalis.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT] Erratum DOI: 10.1007/s12237-014-9788-3},

abstract={Issue Title: Biology and Conservation of Freshwater Bivalves Conservation efforts for freshwater mussels (Unionoida) require a priori assessments of their populations' status quo. Unfortunately, collection of representative census and other data for most European species is currently hampered by an insufficient understanding of inter- and intra-specific variation in distribution patterns. We assessed distribution and movement in three Unio crassus populations and one sympatric population of Anodonta anatina and Unio pictorum, respectively. We surveyed vertical movement across four sediment depths, and horizontal movement by mark-recapture technique in 3-month intervals. For all the populations, movement and the proportion inhabiting surface layers increased considerably from winter to spring/summer. Spatial aggregation levels remained stable for some populations, while others became increasingly randomly distributed during the study. One U. crassus population exhibited elevated mortality and displayed movement rates exceeding twice those of conspecific populations. The visible proportion of U. crassus populations differed by up to 69% between sites. Current monitoring guidelines in Europe often insufficiently account for the extensive inter- and intra-specific differences in spatio-temporal distribution patterns observed. We suggest developing internationally standardised protocols that specify sampling season and methodology. In particular, U. crassus surveys should be restricted to summer months, and hand-sampling is crucial for some populations.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Pearl fishing used to be common in this area in the fifteenth to eighteenth centuries but collapsed afterwards. Long-term field survey undertaken in 2006-2012 revealed that eight populations survived and at least 22 became extinct. The total number of mussels found was about 50,000, with the largest population in one small river consisting of approximately 40,000 individuals. Juveniles were found in six populations. The data obtained are of interest for assessing the resilience and stability of pearl mussel populations in response to potentially negative environmental and particularly anthropogenic impacts. The results are expected to inform future management strategies for conservation of suitable habitats for successful pearl mussel reproduction. The decline in host fish populations in the rivers appears to be the most significant threat to the survival of the existing pearl mussel populations.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

A great bias exists in the research effort, with much more information available for bivalve species belonging to the Unionida in comparison to other groups. The same is true for the origin of these studies, since the publishing pattern does not always correspond to the hotspots of biodiversity but is concentrated in the northern hemisphere mainly in North America, Europe and Russia, with regions such as Africa and Southeast Asia being quite understudied. We also summarize information about past, present and future perspectives concerning the most important research topics that include taxonomy, systematics, anatomy, physiology, ecology and conservation of freshwater bivalves. Finally, we introduce the articles published in this Hydrobiologia special issue related with the International Meeting on Biology and Conservation of Freshwater Bivalves held in 2012 in Bragan<c3><a7>a, Portugal.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Understanding how nutrient cycles and freshwater mussels (Unionoida) affect one another},
abstract={Issue Title: Biology and Conservation of Freshwater Bivalves Nutrient loads and nutrient cycling, especially of phosphorus and nitrogen, are among the most important controls on the character of freshwater ecosystems and have been greatly affected by human actions. Despite the widespread importance of nutrients in freshwater ecosystems, the varied linkages between nutrient cycling and freshwater mussel populations have not been thoroughly described. Here, I explore three of these linkages. First, I suggest that nutrient loads are related to the well-being of mussel populations through several mechanisms, probably producing a nonlinear and non-monotonic relationship between nutrient loads and mussel populations. Second, I discuss the ability of mussels to spatially focus nutrients from the overlying water onto the sediments, which has not been fully appreciated, perhaps because nutrient cycling has been viewed chiefly from the viewpoint of the well-mixed water column rather than the patchy sediments. Third, I discuss the ability of mussel populations to accumulate and release nutrients, introducing time lags into nutrient dynamics and stoichiometry ("nutrient capacitance"). Finally, I propose a speculative analysis of the role of freshwater mussels in the nutrient cycles of pristine river systems, which must have been much greater than in modern rivers, with their high nutrient loads and depleted mussel populations.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Alternative food sources of native and non-native bivalves in a subtropical eutrophic lake},
abstract={Issue Title: Biology and Conservation of Freshwater Bivalves The aim of this study was to evaluate the consumption of alternative food sources (water column and sediment) and the potential competition under different conditions between Diplodon parallelopipedon (native) and Corbicula fluminea (non-native). We evaluated filtration and ingestion rates of water column at 6 and 24 h, held with and without organic matter and different phytoplankton types: needle-shaped green algae (Ankistrodesmus sp.) and filamentous cyanobacteria (Planktothrix agardhii) dominated communities. Our results confirmed higher filtration and ingestion rates per biomass unit for C. fluminea in the presence of sediment without organic matter. However, when we compared the filtration of bivalves held in sediment with organic matter, D. parallelopipedon rates were not significantly different from C. fluminea values. Moreover, in the presence of filamentous cyanobacteria, only C. fluminea filtration and ingestion rates decreased significantly. Our experimental results and previous field evidence concur that C. fluminea were not able to outcompete the native bivalves in organic matter rich sediment and cyanobacteria blooms conditions. The differential responses to the eutrophication process between exotic and native bivalves, apparently favoring the later, might buffer the potential competition interactions allowing their coexistence.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Issue Title: Biology and Conservation of Freshwater Bivalves Genotoxic response of freshwater mussels U. tumidus and U. pictorum to environmental stress was studied using comet assay on hemocytes and gill cells. The mussels were acclimated to controlled laboratory conditions for 10 days, and then exposed at 4 sites in the Sava and Danube rivers in the area of the city of Belgrade. Samples of each species were taken after 7, 14, and 30 days of exposure. The mussels sampled immediately after acclimation served as controls. Genotoxic response in both species was induced earlier at sites receiving untreated wastewaters from the city's main collectors (7 days), than at the site receiving only domestic wastewaters from small settlements located upstream from the city (30 days). There was a correlation between the comet tail intensity values in tissues of exposed mussels and the concentrations of zinc, copper, iron, and arsenic at the exposure sites. The genotoxic responses in both tissues of U. pictorum and in hemocytes of U. tumidus were similar, while U. tumidus gill cells failed to exhibit significant genotoxic response at two sites. These findings, together with higher mortality of U. tumidus at the most polluted sites, promote U. pictorum as a model for genotoxicity monitoring in freshwater environments.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Biodiversity on the brink: an assessment of conservation strategies for North American freshwater mussels},
abstract={Issue Title: Biology and Conservation of Freshwater Bivalves The North America freshwater mussel fauna has suffered an inordinately high recent extinction rate, and the small size and isolation of many remaining populations portends a continued diminishment of this fauna. Causes of extinction and imperilment are varied but revolve around massive habitat loss, deterioration, and fragmentation. The National Strategy for the Conservation of Native Mussels, published in 1997, has guided efforts to address this crisis. Considerable progress has been made toward several of the Strategies' goals, particularly increasing our knowledge of mussel biology, promoting mussel conservation, and development of techniques for captive mussel propagation. However, mussel conservation should focus more directly on reducing fragmentation through bold and aggressive habitat restoration. In addition to dam removal, improvement in dam tailwater flows, and restoration of channelized streams, identification of factors that eliminated mussels from many otherwise intact streams is critical. Translocation and captive propagation will be key elements in reestablishing mussel assemblages in restored habitats, but these techniques should be used with caution and primarily to increase the occurrence of a species throughout its historical range. Conserving mussel diversity in an ever-changing world is dependent on promoting the natural, long-term sustainability and evolutionary potential of mussel populations.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Invasive species represent an increasing fraction of aquatic biota. However, studies on the role and consequences of facilitative interactions among aliens remain scarce. Here, we investigated whether the spread of the alien water boatman Trichocorixa verticalis verticalis in the Iberian Peninsula is related to reduced mortality from predation compared with native Corixidae, especially since Trichocorixa co-occurs with the invasive fishes Gambusia holbrooki and Fundulus heteroclitus. All three invaders have a common native range in North America and are widespread in and around Do<c3><b1>ana in SW Spain. Using laboratory experiments, we compared the predation rates by the two exotic fish and native Odonata larvae on Trichocorixa and the native Sigara lateralis. We found no evidence to suggest that Trichocorixa suffers lower predation rates. However, when both corixids were mixed together, predation of Trichocorixa by Odonata larvae was higher. Odonata larvae were size-limited predators and the proportion of corixids ingested was positively correlated with mask length. Since Trichocorixa is smaller than its native competitors, this may explain their higher susceptibility to predation by Odonata. This may be one of various factors explaining why Trichocorixa is particularly dominant in saline habitats where Odonata are rare, while it is still scarce in fresh waters.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Is habitat amount important for biodiversity in rocky shore systems? A study of South African mussel assemblages},
abstract={Habitat-forming species on rocky shores are often subject to high levels of exploitation, but the effects of subsequent habitat loss and fragmentation on associated species and the ecosystem as a whole are poorly understood. In this study, the effects of habitat amount on the fauna associated with mussel beds were investigated, testing for the existence of threshold effects at small landscape scales. Specifically, the relationships between mussel or algal habitat amount and: associated biodiversity, associated macrofaunal abundance and density of mussel recruits were studied at three sites (Kidd's Beach, Kayser's Beach and Kini Bay) on the southern and south-eastern coasts of South Africa. Samples, including mussel-associated macrofauna, of 10<c2><a0><c3><97><c2><a0>10 cm were taken from areas with 100 % mussel cover (Perna perna or a combination of P. perna and Mytilus galloprovincialis) at each site. The amount of habitat provided by mussels and algae surrounding the sampled areas was thereafter determined at the 4.0 m^sup 2^ scale. A number of significant positive relationships were found between the amount of surrounding mussel habitat and the abundances of several taxa (Anthozoa, Malacostraca and Nemertea). Likewise, there were positive relationships between the amount of surrounding algal habitat and total animal abundance as well as abundance of mussel recruits at one site, Kini Bay. In contrast, abundance of mussel recruits showed a significant negative relationship with the amount of mussel habitat at Kayser's Beach. Significant negative relationships were also detected between the amount of mussel habitat and species richness and total abundance at Kidd's Beach, and between amount of mussel habitat and the abundance of many taxa (Bivalvia, Gastropoda, Maxillopoda, Ophiuroidea, Polychaeta and Pycnogonida) at all three sites. No threshold effects were found, nor were significant relationships consistent across the investigated sites. The results indicate that the surrounding landscape is important in shaping the structure of communities associated with these mussel beds, with significant effects of the amount of surrounding habitat per se. The strength and the direction of habitat effects vary, however, between shores and probably with the scale of observation as well as with the studied dependent variables (e.g. diversity, abundance, mussel recruitment, species identity), indicating the complexity of the processes structuring macrofaunal communities on these shores.

title={Benthic respiration and stoichiometry of regenerated nutrients in lake sediments with Dreissena polymorpha},
abstract={The effect of patchy colonies of the invasive zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) on sedimentary processes was investigated in a mesotrophic lake (Plateliai Lake, Lithuania). Benthic fluxes of O2, TCO2, CH4, Mn^sup 2+^, Fe^sup 2+^, N2, the inorganic forms of N, Si and P and dissolved organic C and N were quantified by dark incubations of sediments cores, with and without D. polymorpha. Individual mussels also were incubated for metabolic measurements. Sediments with D. polymorpha had significantly higher O2 and TCO2 fluxes and displayed higher rates of denitrification. The presence of mussels also resulted in higher regeneration of P and N (mostly as ammonium) while the effect on Si was not significant. However, likely due to the low zebra mussel biomass (57.2<c2><a0><c2><b1><c2><a0>25.3 g^sub SFDW^ m^sup -2^), biodeposition has not changed the ratio between anaerobic and total respiration. Methane and reduced metals fluxes were in fact similar in the presence and absence of D. polymorpha. Incubations of mussels without sediments confirmed that bivalve metabolism was the main driver of benthic respiration and nutrient recycling. Nitrate production suggested the presence of nitrifiers associated with the molluscs. The main outcome of this study was that zebra mussels alter the quantity and the stoichiometry of nutrients regenerated by the benthic compartment. The enhancement of nitrogen loss via denitrification, by a factor of 1.5, was much less pronounced than the increase in ammonium recycling rate, stimulated by a factor of 33.

Further research should address other nutrient sources to the lake to verify whether altered rates and stoichiometry of benthic regeneration can affect primary producer community composition and activity.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Large lakes under changing environmental conditions Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) can be used to provide a baseline stable isotope signature, time-integrated with primary production. However, since zebra mussels are uncommon in pelagic zones, their potential as reference species in pelagic water columns has not been fully explored.

Utilizing cable-dwelling pelagic mussels as indicators of variation in isotope and temperature for pelagic water could be used as a novel field approach, comparable to in situ experimentation. We suggest that the pelagic mussel approach can be employed in tandem with benthic or littoral mussel isotope values, to develop mussel-based lake isoscapes. Such isoscapes may be pertinent to the study of seasonal trophic limnoecology and in tracking the movements of animals.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={The nearshore shunt and the decline of the phytoplankton spring bloom in the Laurentian Great Lakes: insights from a three-dimensional lake model},
abstract={Issue Title: European Large Lakes III. Large lakes under changing environmental conditions Dreissenid mussels have been hypothesized to cause selective decreases of phytoplankton in nearshore areas (nearshore shunt hypothesis) as well as the near-complete loss of the offshore phytoplankton spring bloom in some Laurentian Great Lakes. To evaluate whether mussels can reasonably be expected to mediate such changes, we extended the three-dimensional hydrodynamic-ecological model (ELCOM-CAEDYM) to include mussels as a state variable and applied it to Lake Erie (USA-Canada). Mussel-mediated decreases in mean phytoplankton biomass were highly sensitive to the assigned mussel population size in each basin. In the relatively deep east basin, mussels were predicted to decrease phytoplankton in both nearshore and offshore zones, even during periods of thermal stratification but especially during the spring phytoplankton maximum. Spatially, impacts were associated with mussel distributions but could be strong even in areas without high mussel biomass, consistent with advection from areas of higher mussel biomass. The results supported the nearshore shunt hypothesis that mussel impacts on phytoplankton should be greater in nearshore than offshore waters and also supported suggestions about the emerging importance of deep water offshore mussels. The results of this study provide an important insight into ecological role of mussels in lowering plankton productivity in some world's largest lakes.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Assemblage structure: an overlooked component of human-mediated species movements among freshwater ecosystems},
abstract={The spread and impact of alien species among freshwater ecosystems has increased with global trade and human movement; therefore, quantifying the role of anthropogenic and ecological factors that increase the risk of invasion is an important conservation goal. Two factors considered as null models when assessing the potential for invasion are colonization pressure (i.e., the number of species introduced) and propagule pressure [i.e., the number (propagule size), and frequency (propagule number), of individuals of each species introduced]. We translate the terminology of species abundance distributions to the invasion terminology of propagule size and colonization size (PS and CS, respectively). We conduct hypothesis testing to determine the underlying statistical species abundance distribution for zooplankton assemblages transported between freshwater ecosystems; and, on the basis of a lognormal distribution, construct four hypothetical assemblages spanning assemblage structure, rank-abundance gradient (e.g., even vs uneven), total abundance (of all species combined), and relative contribution of PS vs CS. For a given CS, many combinations of PS and total abundance can occur when transported assemblages conform to a lognormal species abundance distribution; therefore, for a given transportation event, many combinations of CS and PS are possible with potentially different ecological outcomes. An assemblage exhibiting high PS but low CS (species poor, but highly abundant) may overcome demographic barriers to establishment, but with lower certainty of amenable environmental conditions in the recipient region; whereas, the opposite extreme, high CS and low PS (species rich, but low abundance per species) may provide multiple opportunities for one of n arriving species to circumvent environmental barriers, albeit with lower potential to overcome demographic constraints. Species abundance distributions and the corresponding influence of CS and PS are some of many influential factors (e.g., demographic and genetic stochasticity, environmental variability, composition of recipient ecosystems) that will help refine an understanding of establishment risk following the human-mediated movement of species.},

title={Experimental evidence that ecological effects of an invasive fish are reduced at high densities},
abstract={Understanding the relationship between invasive species density and ecological impact is a pressing topic in ecology, with implications for environmental management and policy. Although it is widely assumed that invasive species impact will increase with density, theory suggests interspecific competition may diminish at high densities due to increased intraspecific interactions. To test this theory, we experimentally examined intra- and interspecific interactions between a globally invasive fish, round goby (Neogobius melanostomus), and three native species at different round goby densities in a tributary of the Laurentian Great Lakes. Eighteen 2.25 m^sup 2^ enclosures were stocked with native fish species at natural abundances, while round gobies were stocked at three different densities: 0 m^sup -2^, 2.7 m^sup -2^, and 10.7 m^sup -2^. After 52 days, native fish growth rate was significantly reduced in the low density goby treatment, while growth in the high density goby treatment mirrored the goby-free treatment for two of three native species. Invertebrate density and gut content weight of native fishes did not differ among treatments. Conversely, gut content weight and growth of round gobies were lower in the high goby density treatment, suggesting interactions between round gobies and native fishes are mediated by interference competition amongst gobies. Our experiment provides evidence that invasive species effects may diminish at high densities, possibly due to increased intraspecific interactions. This is consistent with some ecological theory, and cautions against the assumption that invasive species at moderate densities have low impact.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Waterbird-mediated passive dispersal is a viable process for crayfish (Procambarus clarkii)},
abstract={Human transport and active dispersal of the red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) contribute to its rapid spread. However, some small aquatic organisms can be transported by birds. We made two hypotheses related to waterbird-mediated passive dispersal of juvenile crayfish. The first is that, depending on water depth, recently hatched crayfish can attach to ducks, initiating passive external transport (i.e., ectozoochory). The second is that recently hatched crayfish can survive bird flight, being affected by crayfish features, flight distance, and environmental conditions. A first experiment tested the attachment of juvenile crayfish to ducks at different water depths by using a freshly dead duck and tanks with crayfish. Another set of three experiments tested crayfish survival during air transportation. To simulate bird flight, we first used a vehicle moving at bird flight speed, and we then used trained pigeons. Several flight distances, environmental conditions, and crayfish sizes were tested. Our results showed that juvenile crayfish were capable of clinging to duck feathers and were transported when ducks were removed from the water. Furthermore, some juveniles of P. clarkii were able to survive long-distance transport when suspended outside a moving vehicle or when transported by birds. The probability of success was affected by water depth, crayfish size, distance travelled, and relative humidity. Our results support the occurrence of passive transportation of this invader by means of attachment to birds. These findings indicate that waterbird-mediated passive dispersal should be taken into account to explain P. clarkii's rapid spread and should be considered when managing its invasions.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

We investigated (1) if the introduced populations in the Mediterranean region could have originated from these USA populations, (2) how the genetic diversity of Mediterranean compares to that at GSL and SFB, and (3) if genetic patterns in the Mediterranean can shed light on colonization routes. We sequenced a fragment of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and screened microsatellites loci from Mediterranean populations and the two putative USA sources. Haplotypes from Mediterranean populations were identical or closely related to those from SFB and GSL, and not related to other available American populations. Microsatellite analyses showed a reduced population diversity for most Mediterranean populations suggesting bottleneck effects, but few populations were showing similar or higher genetic diversity than native ones, which are likely to be admixed from both GSL and SFB because of multiple introductions. Results suggest natural dispersal, potentially via flamingos, between two Spanish populations. Our analyses show that all invaded populations could have originated from those commercialized USA populations. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={In spite of the general use of diet data in ecological research, still very little is known about the relative roles of spatial, temporal and biotic (e.g. taxonomic identity, size, sex) factors in dietary variability of fishes. Here, we applied canonical correspondence analysis and variation partitioning to examine the roles of taxonomic, annual, seasonal, lake basin, habitat and ontogenetic (standard length, L ^sub S^) factors in the dietary variation of fishes in large and shallow Lake Balaton, Hungary. The analyses were performed at the assemblage (15 fish species) and the individual species levels, and based on high (24 fine resource categories) and low resolution (nine broad resource categories) diet data. As hypothesised, most of the explained variation related to interspecific differences, while the roles of sampling year, season, lake area, habitat and L ^sub S^ proved to be unexpectedly low at the assemblage level. In addition, no regularity was found in how the relative roles of these factors change between fish species. The high ratio of the unexplained variation suggests that individual variations in foraging strategies and resource use of fishes and unascertained stochastic processes had a strong influence on dietary variability both at the assemblage and the individual species levels.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Shallow urban lakes are inherently variable due to their unpredictable mixing regime and often rapid response to the external environment. They therefore present a number of challenges to water managers seeking to improve water quality. Salford Quays (8.14 ha, depth = 6.6 m), Greater Manchester, UK is an example of a managed artificial shallow urban water body that provides a number of ecosystem services but in the past was one of the most polluted areas of water in the UK. Here we examine the long-term dataset (1985 - 2010) associated with restoration and document changes of several orders of magnitude in both phosphorus and chlorophyll- alpha . Three distinct phases of phytoplankton community succession were identified over the restoration period: cyanobacterial dominance, an abundance of larger chlorophytes and finally a preponderance of r-selected taxa such as nanoplankters and cryptomonads. We show that these phases relate to changes in limitation from photolimitation to increased zooplankton grazing and, finally, the combined effects of low nutrients and filter feeding by the invasive bivalve Dreissena polymorpha. Owing to water column mixing and the lack of a littoral zone in the main basins, Salford Quays will be relatively unaffected by confounding variables such as stratification and therefore offers an insight into the processes of community change in similar artificial and heavily modified natural systems elsewhere. In addition the Quays offer an excellent case study of urban water management and serves as an example both of best practice and a target ecosystem to direct the restoration of other urban waterways.},

Undaria pinnatifida was widespread along rocky shores, on other hard substrata and grew in the same areas as Saccharina latissima and Saccorhiza polyschides. Undaria pinnatifida was significantly more abundant on vertical substrata than on upward-facing hard substrata. It was almost as common as all of the other kelp species combined on vertical substrata but was outnumbered by native species on upward-facing substrata.

At the smallest scale, distribution may be orientated in regard to particular environmental variables or habitat features. For animals on the rocky intertidal, the processes which set and maintain patterns of distribution and abundance in wave-exposed areas are well studied, with explanatory models focused on wave action and, more recently, the role of biogenic habitats. In contrast, patterns of orientation by intertidal animals have received less attention, although having ecological and fitness consequences. Here, we report tests of competing models to explain the observation that limpets on steeply sloped surfaces orientate downwards. A greater proportion of downwards-facing limpets was found in sheltered sites and areas without barnacles and this pattern was consistent across many shores and sampling occasions. Additionally, the frequency at which limpets were dislodged after a storm was independent of orientation. To test whether orientation is a behavioural response to habitat-forming barnacles, barnacles were removed and/or killed from patches of substrata and the change in proportion of downwards-facing limpets measured. The proportion increased with barnacle removal and this behaviour was a response to the structure of the barnacles, not a biotic effect associated with the living organism. Our study suggests that biogenic habitat not wave action sets patterns of limpet orientation and barnacle shells, regardless of whether the barnacle is alive or not, limit the ability of limpets to adopt a downward orientation.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Impacts of invasive crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) on endangered freshwater pearl mussels (Margaritifera laevis and M. togakushiensis) in Japan},
abstract={The invasive alien crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus is considered harmful to freshwater pearl mussels Margaritifera laevis and M. togakushiensis. It also often colonises mussel habitats in Japan. In order to test the negative effects of alien crayfish on mussels, we evaluated the predation impact of signal crayfish on freshwater pearl mussels in vitro. We tested the relationship between the survival/injury rates of mussels and crayfish predation with respect to different sizes of mussels (four classes based on shell length: 10, 30, 50 and 70 mm). Crayfish selectively fed on the flesh of the 10-mm size class mussels after breaking their shells. The shell margins of mussels in all size classes were injured by crayfish. Results also showed that crayfish particularly injured the 50-mm size class of mussels. This observation could be attributed to this mussel size being the most suitable shell size (29.56-37.73 mm in carapace length) that the crayfish can effectively hold. This study shows that the presence of invasive crayfish reduces freshwater pearl mussel populations by damaging the shell margins and/or killing the mussels. This negative impact of invasive crayfish not only decreases the mussel population but could also limit mussel recruitment, growth and reproduction.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={The role of Actinobacteria in taste and odour episodes involving geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol in aquatic environments},
abstract={The secondary metabolites geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol (2-MIB) provide soil with its characteristic earthy-musty odour, being notably produced by the abundant spore-forming filamentous bacterial genus Streptomyces, among other Actinobacteria. Taste and odour (T&O) problems attributed to these compounds affect drinking water supplies worldwide, often occurring sporadically and untraced to their biological origins. A number of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms are recognised geosmin and 2-MIB producers in aquatic environments. However, the focus of this paper is to assess the potential contribution of Actinobacteria to this water quality issue. To date, the aquatic ecology of these bacteria remains poorly understood and debate surrounds whether they exist solely as dormant spores of terrestrial origin or are capable of growing and biosynthesising these odourous compounds in aquatic environments. The Actinobacteria which are known to produce geosmin and 2-MIB are identified and a critical assessment of habitats within aquatic environments in which they may be metabolically active residents and thus potential sources of T&O is provided. Current understandings of the chemical ecology and biosynthetic pathways of geosmin and 2-MIB, as well as the conditions under which these secondary metabolites are produced by Streptomyces, are reviewed.},

title={Nuclear and mitochondrial genetic variability of an old invader, Dreissena polymorpha (Bivalvia), in French river basins},
abstract={Analyzing non-native species after their establishment can shed light on factors responsible for their colonization success. The zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha), a species of Ponto-Caspian origin, is a worldwide invader, and was first reported in northern France in the nineteenth century. The genetic diversity and structure of D. polymorpha from five river basins (nine locations) in France were estimated using nuclear markers (amplified fragment length polymorphisms, AFLPs; 154 loci) and sequences from a 514 bp mitochondrial DNA region (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I; COI). Results from the two types of markers were generally congruent, although COI sequences showed limited genetic polymorphism, with one predominant and cosmopolitan haplotype (84 % of the individuals). Both COI and AFLPs revealed that the most divergent and the least polymorphic sample was the one from southern France. This population was the most distant geographically from all the others and among the most recent introductions reported in France. In addition, in northern France, AFLP loci revealed a significant river basin effect, despite a common pathway of introduction. This result suggests a shift in local population dynamics, perhaps due to stochastic recruitment, and underlines the importance of local dispersal (e.g. via planktonic larvae) compared to overland transport in shaping the population structure of this naturalized freshwater mollusk.},

abstract={Issue Title: Streams in mediterranean climate regions: lessons learned from the last decade Mediterranean-climate regions (med-regions) are global hotspots of endemism facing mounting environmental threats associated with human-related activities, including the ecological impacts associated with non-native species introductions. We review freshwater fish introductions across med-regions to evaluate the influences of non-native fishes on the biogeography of taxonomic and functional diversity. Our synthesis revealed that 136 freshwater fish species (26 families, 13 orders) have been introduced into med-regions globally. These introductions, and local extirpations, have increased taxonomic and functional faunal similarity among regions by an average of 7.5% (4.6-11.4%; Jaccard) and 7.2% (1.4-14.0%; Bray-Curtis), respectively. Faunal homogenisation was highest in Chile and the western Med Basin, whereas sw Cape and the Aegean Sea drainages showed slight differentiation (decrease in faunal similarity) over time. At present, fish faunas of different med-regions have widespread species in common (e.g. Gambusia holbrooki, Cyprinus carpio, Oncorhynchus mykiss, Carassius auratus, and Micropterus salmoides) which are typically large-bodied, non-migratory, have higher physiological tolerance, and display fast population growth rates. Our findings suggest that intentional and accidental introductions of freshwater fish have dissolved dispersal barriers and significantly changed the present-day biogeography of med-regions across the globe. Conservation challenges in med-regions include understanding the ecosystem consequences of non-native species introductions at macro-ecological scales.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Stable isotope compositions of recent Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas) shells: paleoenvironmental implications},
abstract={Stable carbon and oxygen isotope studies are among the major proxies in investigations of recent and ancient freshwater environments. Mollusc shells are one the most frequently studied carbonates. In the present paper, stable carbon and oxygen isotope compositions of Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas) shells, regarded as the most aggressive freshwater invader worldwide, is compared with the stable isotope composition of ambient water. Macrophytes with modern D. polymorpha shells attached were sampled twice, in June and August 2011, from four transects established within the littoral of Lake Lednica (western Poland). The macrophytes were sampled between 0.5 and 7 m of depth at each site from the restricted area of the lake bottom. In order to avoid the influence of ontogeny on the results obtained the stable isotope compositions of shells of equal or nearly equal sizes within one population were compared. A significant spread was observed in the stable isotope signatures in the D. polymorpha shells, particularly in the <ce><b4>^sup 13^C values derived from one population. The spread in <ce><b4>^sup 13^C and <ce><b4>^sup 18^O values was observed in both juvenile and adult shells; however, it increased with age. It is suggested that stable isotope investigations of D. polymorpha shells should not be performed on single shells, as the isotope values will not be representative of the coeval individuals within population. While the shells of D. polymorpha were close to oxygen isotope equilibrium with the ambient water, they were characterised by a 1.5-2<c2><a0>[per thousand] depletion in ^sup 13^C relative to <ce><b4>^sup 13^C^sub DIC^. Both the spread in <ce><b4>^sup 13^C values in the shells and the ^sup 13^C depletion observed in the shells are interpreted as resulting from a strong metabolic influence on shell composition. Because the offset observed between dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and shells is relatively constant, the stable carbon isotope composition of D. polymorpha shells may reflect environmental conditions and thus may be used as a palaeolimnological proxy.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Diversity in riverine metacommunities: a network perspective},
abstract={The influence of spatial processes on diversity and community dynamics is generally recognized in ecology and also applied to conservation projects involving forest and grassland ecosystems. Riverine ecosystems, however, have been for a long time viewed from a local or linear perspective, even though the treelike branching of river networks is universal. River networks (so-called dendritic networks) are not only structured in a hierarchic way, but the dendritic landscape structure and physical flows often dictate distance and directionality of dispersal. Theoretical models suggest that the specific riverine network structure directly affects diversity patterns. Recent experimental and comparative data are supporting this idea. Here, I provide an introduction on theoretical findings suggesting that genetic diversity, heterozygosity and species richness are higher in dendritic systems compared to linear or two-dimensional lattice landscapes. The characteristic diversity patterns can be explained in a network perspective, which also offers universal metrics to better understand and protect riverine diversity. I show how appropriate metrics describing network centrality and dispersal distances are superior to classic measures still applied in aquatic ecology, such as Strahler order or Euclidian distance. Finally, knowledge gaps and future directions of research are identified. The network perspective employed here may help to generalize findings on riverine biodiversity research and can be applied to conservation and river restoration projects.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={The introduction of Littorina littorea to British Columbia, Canada: potential impacts and the importance of biotic resistance by native predators},
abstract={Although the establishment and spread of non-indigenous species depends upon survival in the face of novel environmental conditions and novel biological interactions, relatively little attention has been focused on the specific role of native predators in limiting invasion success. The European common periwinkle, Littorina littorea, was recently introduced to the Pacific coast of Canada and provides a case study of an introduction into an area with an important predator guild (sea stars) that is functionally minor in the invader's native habitat. Here, we assess the likelihood of establishment, spread, and negative ecological impact of this introduced gastropod, with an emphasis on the role of native sea stars as agents of biotic resistance. Size frequency distributions and local market availability suggest that L. littorea was most likely introduced via the live seafood trade. Non-native hitchhikers (e.g., the trematode Cryptocotyle lingua) were found on/in both market and field specimens. Laboratory studies and field observations confirmed that L. littorea can survive seasonal low salinity in Vancouver, British Columbia. Periwinkles also readily consumed native Ulva, suggesting that periwinkles could impact native communities via herbivory or resource competition. Unlike native gastropods, however, L. littorea lacked behavioural avoidance responses to Northeast Pacific predatory sea stars (Pisaster ochraceus and Pycnopodia helianthoides), and sea star predation rates on L. littorea were much higher than predation rates on native turban snails (Chlorostoma funebralis) in common garden experiments. We therefore expect periwinkle establishment in British Columbia to be limited to areas with low predator density, as is seen in its field distribution to date. We caution that this conclusion may understate the importance of the L. littorea introduction if it also serves as a vector for additional non-indigenous species such as C. lingua.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Tributyltin (TBT) is a pollutant, mainly introduced to the environment as insecticides, fungicides, bactericides, wood preservatives and marine antifouling agent. Concentrations of TBT and its degradation products were isolated from the bivalve Perna viridis and marine sediments collected from selected coastal areas along Manila Bay. In all samples, the extremely toxic TBT compound was detected, calculated as Sn. In sediments, measured concentration ranged from the limit of detection of 0.5 to 9.0 ng Sn g^sup -1^. Highest levels of TBT were observed at the inner and northern part of the bay, adjacent to coastal areas of varying land and water use (i.e., aquaculture, fishpond, mangrove forests, industrial establishments, and ports). However, the levels decrease near the bay entrance. Accumulation in this area can also be deduced from the movement of the prevailing wind and hydrodynamic behavior of the bay during the time of sampling, which transports suspended sediments from the eastern coast of Manila to the northern coast of Bulacan. In green mussels, the levels of TBT ranged from 2.1 to 8.9 ng Sn g^sup -1^. While these values are relatively low, concentrations as low as 0.659 ng Sn g^sup -1^ have been reported to be toxic to molluscs. The environmental levels of organotin species determined in the samples are comparatively low by global standards. Nevertheless, there is a need to estimate the levels of TBT in coastal waters and its associated uses, to evaluate the effectiveness of imposed regulation prohibiting the application of organotin compounds (OTs) as biocides in antifouling agents on ships and aquaculture facilities.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={A full understanding of life history characteristics of invasive species is a fundamental prerequisite for the development of management strategies. Two introduced goby species (Rhinogobius cliffordpopei and Rhinogobius giurinus) have established highly abundant populations in Lake Erhai (China). In the present study, we examined the reproductive biology of these two species with the aim of improving the efficiency of management strategy. The results indicated that R. cliffordpopei spawned from February to June, whereas R. giurinus spawned from April to August. Rhinogobius cliffordpopei showed higher gonado-somatic indices and had larger eggs than R. giurinus. The adult sex ratio of R. cliffordpopei was female skewed, but that of R. giurinus was equal. Rhinogobius cliffordpopei showed a male-skewed sexual size dimorphism, whereas the body size of R. giurinus varied only slightly between males and females. The different reproductive traits appear as a crucial biologic aspect for developing control programs. Specifically, control measures should be implemented and/or intensified from September to February for R. cliffordpopei and from January to April for R. giurinus. The body size of the smaller R. cliffordpopei females is the determinant for minimal mesh size of the nets used in physical removals of R. cliffordpopei.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Harmful Cyanobacterial Blooms: Causes, Consequences, and Controls},
abstract={Cyanobacteria are the Earth's oldest oxygenic photoautotrophs and have had major impacts on shaping its biosphere. Their long evolutionary history (3.5 by) has enabled them to adapt to geochemical and climatic changes, and more recently anthropogenic modifications of aquatic environments, including nutrient over-enrichment (eutrophication), water diversions, withdrawals, and salinization. Many cyanobacterial genera exhibit optimal growth rates and bloom potentials at relatively high water temperatures; hence global warming plays a key role in their expansion and persistence. Bloom-forming cyanobacterial taxa can be harmful from environmental, organismal, and human health perspectives by outcompeting beneficial phytoplankton, depleting oxygen upon bloom senescence, and producing a variety of toxic secondary metabolites (e.g., cyanotoxins). How environmental factors impact cyanotoxin production is the subject of ongoing research, but nutrient (N, P and trace metals) supply rates, light, temperature, oxidative stressors, interactions with other biota (bacteria, viruses and animal grazers), and most likely, the combined effects of these factors are all involved. Accordingly, strategies aimed at controlling and mitigating harmful blooms have focused on manipulating these dynamic factors. The applicability and feasibility of various controls and management approaches is discussed for natural waters and drinking water supplies. Strategies based on physical, chemical, and biological manipulations of specific factors show promise; however, a key underlying approach that should be considered in almost all instances is nutrient (both N and P) input reductions; which have been shown to effectively reduce cyanobacterial biomass, and therefore limit health risks and frequencies of hypoxic events.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Impacts of excessive dietary phosphorus on zebra mussels},
abstract={Stoichiometric theory predicts that organisms should experience dietary imbalances not only when nutrients (e.g., phosphorus, P) are limiting relative to carbon (C), but also when nutrients are in excess (i.e., well above somatic demand). Nevertheless, few experiments have elucidated the response of consumers in such low C:P conditions. We assessed the growth, tissue stoichiometry, and nutrient excretion of the invasive primary consumer, zebra mussel (ZM), Dreissena polymorpha, under three dietary C:P conditions (C:P<c3><82> =<c3><82> 20, 45, 380) in the laboratory. The two low C:P conditions represent increasingly common eutrophic systems, while the high C:P treatment is representative of oligotrophic systems. Growth rates and condition were lower when ZMs were fed a low C:P (20 and 45) diet, compared to the C:P<c3><82> =<c3><82> 380 treatment, wherein ZMs grew rapidly and exhibited lower somatic C:P. Furthermore, ZMs in the C:P<c3><82> =<c3><82> 20 and C:P<c3><82> =<c3><82> 45 treatments excreted more ammonia indicative of protein catabolism. These results clearly show that hypereutrophic conditions invoke significant shifts in physiology, growth, and condition of ZMs. Together, these results are consistent with stoichiometric theory that predicts costs associated with the intake of excess dietary P.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Living at the edge of the front; reduced predation risk to invasive round goby in a Great Lakes tributary},
abstract={The objective of this research was to determine if the highly invasive round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) experiences lower predation risk during early stages of invasion. We compared round goby predation rates between a recently invaded area (occupied for <c3><a2>[per thousand] 1<c3><82> year) and a longer established area (<c3><a2>[per thousand] 7<c3><82> years) of the Trent River, Ontario, Canada. Tethering trials were conducted in three habitat types, and comparable habitats in the two areas were similar in water temperature, velocity and depth. Predation rates of tethered round gobies were on average 27% lower in the recently invaded area. Reduced predation in the recently invaded area may be due to the short duration of round goby occupancy and/or differences in predator communities between the two study areas. Data before the round goby invasion suggest that predator communities were similar between the two range areas, but differences in predator abundance cannot be ruled out as a potential mechanism. Other possible mechanisms include a numerical or learned response by predators over time to a novel prey item. Reduced predation rate during the initial stages of invasion may contribute to the fitness of individuals that migrate into areas not previously occupied, and thus facilitate successful range expansion.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Evaluating the combined threat of climate change and biological invasions on endangered species},
abstract={Climate change and invasive species are two major biodiversity threats expected to provoke extinctions of many species in the future. This study evaluates the joint threat posed by climate change and two invasive species: the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) and the signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus), on the distribution of two endangered freshwater species: the depressed river mussel (Pseudanodonta complanata) and the white-clawed crayfish (Austropotamobius pallipes), at the scale of Europe. We expected the native species to experience a gradual contraction over time in their geographic range size, while the invasive species would maintain or increase their spread; therefore, their overlap would increase, further threatening the conservation of the native species. To test these three hypotheses, ensemble species distribution models (SDMs) were calibrated with current distributions and projected onto present and 2050 future climatic scenarios. In agreement with our expectations, the 2050 scenarios suggested D. polymorpha may strongly benefit from climate changes (increase of 15-20% in range size), while the depressed river mussel would experience a considerable loss (14-36%), the overlap between both mussels increasing up to 24%. Although both crayfishes were predicted to be negatively affected by climate changes, the contraction was more severe for the invasive P. leniusculus (up to 32% decrease in range size). Moreover, the overlap between both crayfishes decreased by 13-16%, which may reduce the pressure upon the native A. pallipes. This study illustrates how SDMs can assist in management of endangered species over large spatial and temporal scales by identifying current and future areas of shared bioclimatic suitability and potential refugia.},

As old clams died, their valves provided a hard substrate on the bottom surface, facilitating recruitment.

abstract={The current freshwater fish fauna crisis is such that natural resource managers urgently need to identify priorities and understand the management consequences of actions aimed at maximizing the preservation of biodiversity. Freshwater research is often poorly linked to conservation ecology; and interdisciplinary studies illustrating examples of freshwater ecosystem conservation are scarce. The Iberian Peninsula has a long history of anthropogenic disturbance that has led to the poor conservation status of its ichthyofauna, with 52 % of species now catalogued as critically endangered, endangered or vulnerable, according to UICN criteria. This paper gives an overview of the main threats (habitat degradation, hydrological alterations and exotic species) that have altered the function and connectivity of Iberian rivers. Case-study examples are provided to analyse the repercussions of these threats and the management actions planned or already performed in these systems. The interaction of many threats is responsible for native fish decline. However, freshwater managers and researchers should not let the trees prevent them from seeing the overall wood, when seeking to achieve practical solutions with the best balanced cost benefit and the collaboration of all ecosystem researchers and stakeholders. Conservation efforts should be focused on the preservation of ecological processes, in order to achieve the goals of the Water Framework Directive and guarantee the conservation of Iberian native fish species.

abstract={The introduction of alien species leads to changes in species composition and therefore the trophic structure. The highly invasive freshwater mysid Limnomysis benedeni is established and abundant in Lake Constance since 2006. Our aim was to confirm the assumption that L. benedeni feds on small particles and to identify their food web position. We examined the feeding mode and food preference of adult L. benedeni collected from the field and from laboratory feeding experiments by analysing their stomach contents. Stable isotope analyses (SIA) confirm an omnivorous feeding of L. benedeni. In laboratory growth experiments, we determined the growth of juveniles by feeding juveniles with different natural food sources. Growth was supported by natural biofilm, dreissenid biodeposited material and an algal suspension. Stomach analyses showed clearly that L. benedeni fed on small particles of both benthic and pelagic origin and fed by both filtering and grazing. Absence of high numbers of animal structures in the stomachs and SIA supported the lack of predatory impact in the field, but the mysid probably affects the nutrient cycles in the littoral. L. benedeni seems to play an important role in the trophic relations in Lake Constance and all other water bodies they invaded.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={The development of robust morphometric indices from accurate and precise measurements of free-swimming whale sharks using laser photogrammetry},
abstract={To enable the study of population dynamics of wild animals the determination of the age, growth rate and maturity status of a sample of the individuals present is required; consequently, obtaining repeated accurate and precise total length (TL) measurements for individuals over time can be especially valuable. However, there are limited easily applied methods to ascertain the TL of large free-swimming fish, especially the largest extant species of fish, the whale shark (Rhincodon typus). This study expands on previous work and presents the results of a robust laser photogrammetry system developed to achieve accurate TL, pre-caudal length (PCL) and further morphometric measurements of whale sharks observed between 2009 and 2011 in seasonal feeding aggregations located in the Seychelles and Djibouti. Calculations for repeatability (r) indicated a high level of precision for the system with r approaching 1 for both TL and PCL, increasing further with the use of morphometric measurements. TL measurements of 'straight sample sharks' also provided geometric mean linear regression equations to enable the prediction of TL from defined morphological indices. Continuous validation of the system against objects of a fixed length also indicated a high level of accuracy for the method of measurement. We concluded that the laser photogrammetry system can be confidently employed to obtain accurate in-water TL, PCL and morphometric measurements for R. typus, with wide ranging implications and applications for the study of R. typus, and other large marine fauna.

title={Comparative feeding ecology of invasive Ponto-Caspian gobies},
abstract={Invasions of Ponto-Caspian gobiid fishes are suspected to cause regime shifts in freshwater ecosystems. This study compared the trophic niche differentiations of Neogobius melanostomus and Ponticola kessleri in the upper Danube River using stable isotope analyses (<ce><b4>^sup 13^C and <ce><b4>^sup 15^N), gut content analyses and morphometric analyses of the digestive tract. Both species were identified as predacious omnivores with high dietary overlap and a generalistic feeding strategy. Amphipods (especially invasive Dikerogammarus spp.) contributed 2/3 to the index of food importance. <ce><b4>^sup 15^N-signatures of N. melanostomus revealed an ontogenetic diet shift and significantly exceeded those in P. kessleri by ~1.5[per thousand], indicating a niche separation of half a trophic level. P. kessleri had shorter uncoiled intestinal tracts than N. melanostomus, indicating a narrower niche and adaptation to animal food. Trophic niches in both species expanded during the growth period with increasing intraguild predation and cannibalism in P. kessleri and increasing molluscivory in N. melanostomus. P. kessleri showed a higher degree of specialization and more stable feeding patterns across seasons, whereas N. melanostomus adapted its diet according to the natural prey availability. The feeding patterns of both species observed in the upper Danube River strongly differ from those in their native ranges, underlining their great plasticity. Both goby species consumed mainly other non-native species (~92% of gut contents) and seemed to benefit from previous invasions of prey species like Dikerogammarus villosus. The invasive success of gobies and their prey mirror fundamental ecological changes in large European freshwater ecosystems.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={DNA-based species detection capabilities using laser transmission spectroscopy},
abstract={Early detection of invasive species is critical for effective biocontrol to mitigate potential ecological and economic damage. Laser transmission spectroscopy (LTS) is a powerful solution offering real-time, DNA-based species detection in the field. LTS can measure the size, shape and number of nanoparticles in a solution and was used here to detect size shifts resulting from hybridization of the polymerase chain reaction product to nanoparticles functionalized with species-specific oligonucleotide probes or with the species-specific oligonucleotide probes alone. We carried out a series of DNA detection experiments using the invasive freshwater quagga mussel (Dreissena bugensis) to evaluate the capability of the LTS platform for invasive species detection. Specifically, we tested LTS sensitivity to (i) DNA concentrations of a single target species, (ii) the presence of a target species within a mixed sample of other closely related species, (iii) species-specific functionalized nanoparticles versus species-specific oligonucleotide probes alone, and (iv) amplified DNA fragments versus unamplified genomic DNA. We demonstrate that LTS is a highly sensitive technique for rapid target species detection, with detection limits in the picomolar range, capable of successful identification in multispecies samples containing target and non-target species DNA. These results indicate that the LTS DNA detection platform will be useful for field application of target species. Additionally, we find that LTS detection is effective with species-specific oligonucleotide tags alone or when they are attached to polystyrene nanobeads and with both amplified and unamplified DNA, indicating that the technique may also have versatility for broader applications.},

title={Information in support of a recovery potential assessment of Hickorynut (Obovaria olivaria) in Canada},
abstract={In May 2011, the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) assessed the status of Hickorynut (Obovaria olivaria) and determined the designation to be Endangered. The reason provided for this designation is that, "This freshwater mussel lives in mid-sized to large rivers in southern Ontario and Quebec. There has been an historical decline in the species' distribution with losses of the populations in the Detroit and Niagara rivers. Other locations are threatened by the continuing invasion of dreissenid mussels. In addition, the one known host of this mussel, the Lake Sturgeon, is at risk and may be declining in some locations where the mussel is known to still occur. The species is also affected by degraded water quality in many freshwater systems in southern Ontario and Quebec". Hickorynut is currently not listed under the Species at Risk Act (SARA). The Recovery Potential Assessment (RPA) provides information and scientific advice needed to fulfill various requirements of SARA, including informing both scientific and socio-economic elements of the listing decision and permitting activities that would otherwise violate SARA prohibitions and the development of recovery strategies. This Research Document describes the current state of knowledge of the biology, ecology, distribution, population trends, habitat requirements, and threats to Hickorynut. Mitigation measures and alternative activities related to the identified threats, which can be used to protect the species, are also presented. The information contained in the RPA and this document may be used to inform the development of recovery documents and for assessing permits, agreements and related conditions, as per section 73, 74, 75, 77 and 78 of SARA. The scientific information also serves as advice to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) regarding the listing of the species under SARA and is used when analyzing the socio-economic impacts of adding the species to the list as well as during subsequent consultations, where applicable. This assessment considers the available scientific data with which to assess the recovery potential of Hickorynut in Canada.Original Abstract: En mai 2011, le Comite sur la situation des especes en peril au Canada (COSEPAC) a evalue la situation de l'obovarie olivatre (Obovaria olivaria) et lui a attribue le statut d'espece en voie de disparition.

title={Tracking the distribution of non-native marine invertebrates (Mytella charruana, Perna viridis and Megabalanus coccopoma) along the south-eastern USA},
abstract={Our study tracked three non-native, marine, sessile, invertebrate species which have recently colonized the south-eastern United States Atlantic coastlines and estuaries: Mytella charruana, the charru mussel; Perna viridis, the Asian green mussel; and Megabalanus coccopoma, the titan acorn barnacle. Along the eastern Floridian coast, Mytella charruana was discovered in the Indian River Lagoon, Florida (FL) in 2004. Perna viridis was found in Ponce de Leon Inlet, FL in 2002, after being introduced to Tampa Bay, FL in 1989. Megabalanus coccopoma was documented in St Augustine, FL and Brunswick, Georgia in 2006. From 2006 through to 2011, a biannual survey of the south-eastern Atlantic coastlines and estuaries was conducted from Jupiter, Florida to Charleston, South Carolina (894 km) to document the distribution and range expansion of M. charruana, P. viridis and M. coccopoma. Field surveys were conducted in June and December each year at 82 sites (e.g. docks, boat ramps, jetties and mangrove roots). The ranges of the three invertebrates have expanded and retracted along the Atlantic coast since the survey began. Mytella charruana had spread as far north as Savannah, Georgia in 2007, but the species was absent from northern Georgia in 2010 and 2011. Perna viridis and M. coccopoma were present in Georgia in 2007, but were absent in the 2010 and 2011 surveys. These range fluctuations may be explained by extreme cold temperatures, which occurred during the 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 winters. The patterns observed with these three sessile invertebrates provide information regarding how non-native species disperse and establish in new locations. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Retrospective Analyses of Inputs of Municipal Wastewater Effluent and Coupled Impacts on an Urban Lake},
abstract={A retrospective review and analysis are presented of the evolution of treatment, point of discharge considerations, and constituent loading from the Metropolitan Syracuse Wastewater Treatment Plant (Metro), and the coupled water quality effects on the receiving urban lake (Onondaga Lake, New York) from the early 1970s to 2010. The analysis is based on long-term monitoring of the discharge, Onondaga Lake, and a nearby river system considered as a potential alternate to receive the effluent. The Metro discharge is extraordinarily large relative to the lake's hydrologic budget, representing approximately 25% of the total inflow, greater than for any other lake in the United States. The large loads of nitrogen and phosphorus received from the facility resulted in severe water quality effects in the lake during the early portion of record, including (1) violations of standards to protect against toxic effects of ammonia and nitrite, (2) violations of the water clarity standard for swimming safety, (3) exceedances of a limit for the summer average concentration of total phosphorus in the upper waters, and (4) lakewide violations of the oxygen standard during fall turnover. The effects of Metro were compounded by effects of discharges from soda ash/chlor-alkali and pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities. The sedimentary record of the lake indicates that even greater levels of cultural eutrophication prevailed before the monitoring commenced. Dramatic improvements in the water quality of the lake were achieved in recent years by implementing advanced treatment technologies. Exceedances of receiving water limits in the lake were eliminated, with the exception of the total phosphorus limit. A zebra mussel invasion compromised the oxygen resources and assimilative capacity of the nearby river for more than 15 years. This eliminated an option, previously supported by managers, of full diversion of the Metro effluent to the river. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Effects of flow restoration on mussel growth in a Wild and Scenic North American River},
abstract={Doc number: 6 Abstract Background: Freshwater mussels remain among the most imperiled species in North America due primarily to habitat loss or degradation. Understanding how mussels respond to habitat changes can improve conservation efforts. Mussels deposit rings in their shell in which age and growth information can be read, and thus used to evaluate how mussels respond to changes in habitat. However, discrepancies between methodological approaches to obtain life history information from growth rings has led to considerable uncertainty regarding the life history characteristics of many mussel species. In this study we compared two processing methods, internal and external ring examination, to obtain age and growth information of two populations of mussels in the St. Croix River, MN, and evaluated how mussel growth responded to changes in the operation of a hydroelectric dam. Results: External ring counts consistently underestimated internal ring counts by 4 years. Despite this difference, internal and external growth patterns were consistent. In 2000, the hydroelectric dam switched from operating on a peaking schedule to run-of-the-river/partial peaking. Growth patterns between an upstream and downstream site of the dam were similar both before and after the change in operation. At the downstream site, however, older mussels had higher growth rates after the change in operation than the same sized mussels collected before the change. Conclusions: Because growth patterns between internal and external processing methods were consistent, we suggest that external processing is an effective method to obtain growth information despite providing inaccurate age information. External processing is advantageous over internal processing due to its non-destructive nature. Applying this information to analyze the influence of the operation change in the hydroelectric dam, we suggest that changing to run-of-the-river/partial peaking operation has benefited the growth of older mussels below the dam.},

title={North Atlantic coastal lagoons: conservation, management and research challenges in the twenty-first century},
abstract={Coastal lagoons provide socio-economically valuable ecosystem services and are important habitats for conservation. Rare around North Atlantic coastlines, they are increasingly threatened by climatic and anthropogenic stressors. Despite repeated calls at the end of the twentieth century for further research to be urgently undertaken to underpin management of these habitats and the rare, specialist species they support, progress on North Atlantic lagoons has apparently lagged behind other European lagoon types. In the context of increasing pressure on coastal resources, we summarise current ecological knowledge and consider contemporary issues, concepts and techniques to identify the conservation, management and research challenges that need to be addressed if North Atlantic lagoons are to be safeguarded and sustainably managed in the twenty-first century. Priority issues relate to the lack of scientific understanding of lagoon functioning and variability, and include the need for reliable identification and classification of the resource, assessing responses to anthropogenic impacts (notably climate change) and applying ecosystem-specific management and monitoring. Key recommendations are (i) specialised surveys that recognise the inherent dynamism of the environment and facilitate a more accurate description of the lagoonal resource and its ecology, and (ii) an ecocomplex approach for conservation and management that addresses coastal habitat connectivity.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Effect of substratum drying on the survival and migrations of Ponto-Caspian and native gammarids (Crustacea: Amphipoda)},
abstract={Organisms inhabiting shallow near-shore waters are at risk of desiccation during water level fluctuations. Using laboratory experiments, we investigated the survival and behavioural defences of four freshwater amphipod species during substratum drying: three Ponto-Caspian invaders (Pontogammarus robustoides, Dikerogammarus haemobaphes and Dikerogammarus villosus) and the native Gammarus fossarum. We hypothesized that they would be able to survive air exposure events as well as to adjust their behaviour by following the decreasing water level and/or burying in the sediments. To test these hypotheses, we examined survival of each species on gradually drying sandy substratum as well as their horizontal and vertical migration behaviours. P. robustoides was most resistant to substratum drying and was the only species burying into the substratum. On the other hand, G. fossarum exhibited distinct horizontal migrations following the retreating waterline. These two species seem to be particularly well adapted to the drying environment. Defence mechanisms of D. haemobaphes and D. villosus were less efficient, though the former species also followed the retreating waterline to some extent. Our study demonstrates that exotic and native gammarids have several adaptations that enable them to invade and persist in habitats experiencing common water level fluctuations.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

(1995), before describing specific objectives for the most important fishes (which have received the most attention), provided an overarching goal of maintaining the biological integrity of the system. In this concluding chapter, researchers, the Lake Michigan Committee, evaluate what has transpired during this reporting period, 2005-2010, in relation to specific objectives, as well as to the maintenance of biological integrity, all within the context of the ten guiding principles. Researchers also include three recommendations endorsed by the Lake Michigan Technical Committee, which may provide guidance for the achievement or maintenance of the specific objectives. Lastly, researchers offer their own considerations regarding the biological integrity of the Lake Michigan ecosystem and the impediments to the ultimate achievement of the FCOs.},

abstract={Achieving those Inshore and Benthivore Objectives that were unmet may require modifying the management approach. For example, implementation of the previously developed DA model would formalize and improve management of yellow perch. For other fishes, adopting improved indicators that trigger management action would be beneficial. Inclusion of pre-recruit indexes in lake whitefish stock assessment models would improve management of this species, and management of most nearshore and benthivore species would be improved by adoption of comprehensive fish-health monitoring, including management triggers for emerging fish-health issues. By improving habitat (in combination with temporary supplementation of recruitment through techniques, such as streamside rearing) where degradation has depressed recruitment of inshore and benthivore fishes, good progress can be made towards achieving objectives. Improvement of fish passage for lake sturgeon would provide the greatest immediate dividends for this species as well as others. Additionally, wetland and river restoration activities would benefit a wide variety of species, including northern pike, muskellunge, and walleye.},

title={Drivers of change in estuarine-coastal ecosystems: Discoveries from four decades of study in San Francisco Bay},
abstract={Poised at the interface of rivers, ocean, atmosphere and dense human settlement, estuaries are driven by a large array of natural and anthropogenic forces. San Francisco Bay exemplifies the fast-paced change occurring in many of the world's estuaries, bays, and inland seas in response to these diverse forces. We use observations from this particularly well-studied estuary to illustrate responses to six drivers that are common agents of change where land and sea meet: water consumption and diversion, human modification of sediment supply, introduction of nonnative species, sewage input, environmental policy, and climate shifts. In San Francisco Bay, responses to these drivers include, respectively, shifts in the timing and extent of freshwater inflow and salinity intrusion, decreasing turbidity, restructuring of plankton communities, nutrient enrichment, elimination of hypoxia and reduced metal contamination of biota, and food web changes that decrease resistance of the estuary to nutrient pollution. Detection of these changes and discovery of their causes through environmental monitoring have been essential for establishing and measuring outcomes of environmental policies that aim to maintain high water quality and sustain services provided by estuarine-coastal ecosystems. The many time scales of variability and the multiplicity of interacting drivers place heavy demands on estuarine monitoring programs, but the San Francisco Bay case study illustrates why the imperative for monitoring has never been greater.},

abstract={The accumulation of cyanobacterial biomass may severely affect the performance of aquatic consumers. Here, we investigated the role of sterols in determining the food quality of cyanobacteria for the invasive clam Corbicula fluminea, which has become a common benthic invertebrate in many freshwater ecosystems throughout the world. In standardized growth experiments, juvenile clams were fed mixtures of different cyanobacteria (Anabaena variabilis, Aphanothece clathrata, Synechococcus elongatus) or sterol-containing eukaryotic algae (Cryptomonas sp., Nannochloropsis limnetica, Scenedesmus obliquus). In addition, the cyanobacterial food was supplemented with different sterols. We provide evidence that somatic growth of C. fluminea on cyanobacterial diets is constrained by the absence of sterols, as indicated by a growth-enhancing effect of sterol supplementation. Thus, our findings contribute to our understanding of the consequences of cyanobacterial mass developments for benthic consumers and highlight the importance of considering sterols as potentially limiting nutrients in aquatic food webs.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={We studied Ensis directus in the subtidal (7-16<c2><a0>m depth) of the eastern German Bight. The jack-knife clam that invaded in the German Bight in 1978 has all characteristics of a successful immigrant: Ensis directus has a high reproductive capacity (juveniles, July 2001: Amrumbank 1,914<c2><a0>m^sup -2^, Eiderstedt/Vogelsand: 11,638<c2><a0>m^sup -2^), short generation times and growths rapidly: maximum growth rates were higher than in former studies (mean: 3<c2><a0>mm<c2><a0>month^sup -1^, 2nd year: up to 14<c2><a0>mm<c2><a0>month^sup -1^). Ensis directus uses natural mechanisms for rapid dispersal, occurs gregariously and exhibits a wide environmental tolerance. However, optimal growth and population-structure annual gaps might be influenced by reduced salinity: at Vogelsand (transition area of Elbe river), maximum growth was lower (164<c2><a0>mm) than at the Eiderstedt site (outer range of Elbe river, L ^sub <e2><88><9e>^<c2><a0>=<c2><a0>174<c2><a0>mm). Mass mortalities of the clams are probably caused by washout (video inspections), low winter temperature and strong storms. Ensis directus immigrated into the community finding its own habitat on mobile sands with strong tidal currents. Recent studies on E. directus found that the species neither suppresses native species nor takes over the position of an established one which backs up our study findings over rather short time scales. On the contrary, E. directus seems to favour the settlement of some deposit feeders. Dense clam mats might stabilise the sediment and function as a sediment-trap for organic matter. Ensis directus has neither become a nuisance to other species nor developed according to the 'boom-and-bust' theory. The fate of the immigrant E. directus rather is a story of a successful trans-ocean invasion which still holds on 23<c2><a0>years after the first findings in the outer elbe estuary off Vogelsand.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={In this paper, we (1) describe field observations of lake charr (trout) reproductive behaviour, focusing on two morphs from Great Bear Lake, N.T; (2) review and synthesize observations from the literature; and (3) summarize uncertainties and pose hypotheses regarding lake trout spawning behaviour. Our description is set within the context of an existing conceptual model that included three sequential stages to spawning behaviour--traveling, sinking, and gamete release. Spawning morphs did not overlap in time and space. Strong onshore winds seemed to trigger lake trout movement toward shoals in mid- to late-August where males outnumbered and seemed to precede female arrival at the shoals. A new behaviour termed finning was observed and interpreted as display courtship. Finning was observed at all spawning sites in Great Bear Lake and involved two or more fish that were either stationary or moving slowly just beneath the water surface with a partially erect dorsal fin, adipose fin, and only occasionally the dorsal lobe of the caudal fin breaking the water surface. On the basis of our observations and review of the literature, we propose to modify the Esteve et al. model to add (1) pre-courtship and spawning behaviour and (2) display courtship behaviour as occurring prior to traveling, sinking, and gamete release. Potential future research questions are described to address uncertainties regarding how spawning lake trout relate to their physical habitat, environmental cues to spawning, factors driving assortative mating among morphs, and the role of olfactory cues in spawning.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Does functional redundancy of communities provide insurance against human disturbances? An analysis using regional-scale stream invertebrate data},
abstract={Human-induced reductions in species richness might alter the quality of ecosystem services when the remaining species are not able to substitute the functions provided by extirpated species. We examined how human disturbances (nutrient enrichment, land use intensification, instream habitat degradation and the presence of alien species) influence the species richness of stream invertebrates. Stream invertebrates (425 native species) were collected by kick and sweep sampling technique at 274 stream sites covering the entire area of Hungary. We measured the species richness, functional richness (i.e. number of unique functional roles provided by community members) and functional redundancy (i.e. the functional insurance of the community) using information on the feeding habits of each species. To remove the effect of natural variability, we tested the effect of stressors on the residuals of models relating species richness, functional richness and functional redundancy with natural environmental gradients. Our results showed that species richness was negatively influenced by instream habitat degradation and nutrient enrichment. Independent of the way of quantifying functional richness and functional redundancy, we found that functional richness is more sensitive to human impact than functional redundancy of stream invertebrates. The finding that a reduction of species richness is associated with a loss of unique functional roles (functional richness) is important for conservation issues, because the number of unique functional roles is usually regarded as driver of ecosystem functioning.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

We collected rudds with a variety of gears in 2009 to test these hypotheses, and used data from 2007 to 2010 seining surveys to determine if the relative abundance of young-of-the-year rudd differed among sites with different flow conditions. Rudds were mostly herbivorous; they consumed aquatic macrophytes in summer and supplemented their diet with algae and fish in spring and fall. Feeding intensity was positively correlated with water temperature, but significantly reduced during spawning. Rudd condition and growth were greater than estimates from other populations, suggesting increases in abundance and range expansion are possible. Furthermore, reproduction was successful at lotic sites but very poor at sites without measureable flow, contrary to the paradigm of optimal rudd habitat. Research is needed to understand how herbivory by abundant rudd populations affects native aquatic communities.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={The exotic aquatic mud snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum (Hydrobiidae, Mollusca): state of the art of a worldwide invasion},
abstract={Biological invasions represent a relevant ecological and economic problem of our globalized world. While a few species have been classified as invasive due to their ecological and economic impacts on the invaded ecosystems (e.g., zebra mussel), others show contrasting invasive potential, depending on the invaded ecosystem and/or the traits of the exotic species. This paper reviews the worldwide distribution, ecological impacts and the reasons that explain the invasive success of the aquatic mud snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum Gray (Hydrobiidae, Mollusca), which is native to New Zealand. This review shows that most studies on P. antipodarum distribution have been conducted in Europe, North America and Australia, and few studies in Asia. The distribution of this snail is still unknown in other parts of the world (e.g., Africa, South and Central America). The range of invaded aquatic ecosystems varies from fresh to salt water and from lentic to lotic ecosystems. The ecological impact of this species is due to the fast population growth rate and to the extremely high densities that it can reach, leading to altered C and N cycles in invaded ecosystems. However, at low densities mud snails have been shown to enhance secondary production. Additionally, P. antipodarum has been found to overcome the negative effects of predators and parasites (e.g., it survives the pass through the digestive tracts of fish). This review contributes to assess the magnitude and ecological risk of P. antipodarum invasion throughout the world.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Oligotrophication from wetland epuration alters the riverine trophic network and carrying capacity for fish},
abstract={Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) constitutes a major component of fish habitat, providing support for epiphytes and invertebrates as well as shelter from predators. The effects of wetland epuration from a mesotrophic to a nearly oligotrophic state were examined over a 15<c2><a0>km long reach of the St. Lawrence River under the direct influence of major farmland tributaries. We hypothesized that the nutrient-enriched zone would support a higher biomass of SAV, epiphytes, macroinvertebrates and fish than the nitrogen-deficient epurated zone located downstream of the wetland. Predictions included that the enriched habitat would support a richer fish assemblage, with higher biomass and growth of juvenile yellow perch than found in the epurated zone. Results supported these hypotheses, demonstrating the chain of effects of nutrient reduction on the biomass of SAV (fourfold drop), invertebrate prey (ninefold), small (threefold) and large (1.5-fold) fish between the two zones. In addition to the reduction in SAV biomass, the replacement of filamentous chlorophytes by benthic mats of filamentous cyanobacteria in the epurated zone resulted in a less complex 3-D habitat structure and a low invertebrate availability for fish. Oligotrophication by wetland epuration exerted negative effects on fish habitat quality, food quantity and availability, with an impairment of juvenile perch growth and recruitment. A generalized model of the changes in habitat carrying capacity occurring with epuration (oligotrophication) or eutrophication is presented, with examples of other aquatic systems in which strong linkages between trophic status, SAV, invertebrates and fish productivity were also demonstrated.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

The activities of three antioxidant enzymes, catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and the phase II detoxifying enzyme glutathione S-transferase (GST), were measured in the cytosolic fraction from a pool of zebra mussels. Significant variations in the activity of each single enzyme were noticed at each treatment, indicating that exposure to BDE-154 was able to impair the oxidative status of treated bivalves through the increase of reactive oxygen species. In detail, SOD and GPx were significantly induced, while CAT and GST were depressed with respect to the baseline levels. These data have confirmed that the raise of oxidative stress is the main cause of the BDE-154-induced genetic damage observed in a previous study on the zebra mussel. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={A review on the "in vitro" culture of freshwater mussels (Unionoida)},
abstract={Many Unionoida are considered to be extinct, endangered, or of special concern. These bivalves have complex life cycle stages that limit successful culture. In nature, the larvae (glochidia) of these bivalves must successfully parasitize a host (mainly fish) in order to metamorphose into juveniles. The two artificial methods used to obtain juvenile freshwater mussels in laboratory are either by induced attachment to host fish or by in vitro culture of glochidia. This article is focused on the in vitro method that represents a novel and alternative process to fish infestation, offering the ability to obtain larger numbers of juveniles without the need for host fishes and reducing the overall costs of propagation. In vitro culture requires a medium which fulfills the nutritional needs of each glochidia species and avoids microbial contamination. Recently, this methodology has presented excellent results with survival and transformation rates up to 94% using host fish plasma. High efficiencies on growth, and survival rates (84%) of juvenile freshwater bivalve Hyriopsis myersiana (Lea, 1856) up to 120<c2><a0>days were obtained when reared in adequate recirculating aquacultural systems using a very specific diet. More research is still needed to demonstrate successful propagation, mainly concerning the media nutritional composition to increase glochidia transformation and juvenile quality.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={The rates of upstream and downstream range expansion of the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) were examined in the Trent-Severn Waterway in 2009 and 2010. Relative abundance, demographics, and habitat use were also compared between areas of range expansion and a longer established area to determine how these characteristics varied along the invasion pathway. Round gobies were sampled using an angling removal method in May and August of 2009 and 2010 at 75 sites at each area of range expansion and 25 sites near the center of their range where they first became established in the waterway. Areas of range expansion had initially low abundance and low site occupancy in May 2009 relative to the longer established area. Large increases in abundance and site occupancy were observed over the first summer of occupation, but with limited range expansion. Rapid range expansion was observed during the non-reproductive season at the upstream edge of range. Individuals sampled in the expanded upstream range were small and female biased relative to other range locations. Round gobies also exhibited higher habitat selectivity for rocky substrates at range edges than in the longer established area. These characteristics of seasonal dispersal, biased demographics of dispersers, and high habitat selectivity may be important components of successful range expansion of the round goby in invaded ecosystems.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Biological invasions and climatic warming: implications for south-eastern Aegean ecosystem functioning},
abstract={The Aegean Sea, due to the complexity and variety of morphological features, bathymetry, hydrological, hydrodynamic features and climatic characteristics, offers a unique opportunity for monitoring the spreading and/or invasion of alien biota. It is known that the establishment of warm/tropical marine alien species is related mainly to the increase in sea temperature. A significant increase in aliens' number along the southern Aegean (Dodecanese) coasts has been documented in the last twenty years, while their arrival has produced evident changes in coastal ecosystem composition and function. Although the study area acts as a crossroad for tropical alien species introduction in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, a direct attempt to link temperature alterations with new alien species arrivals has not been performed. Satellite and in situ derived marine temperature data showed that the study area has gone through a remarkable warming, while the link between global temperatures and regional ones revealed that this warming is not a local phenomenon but part of global climate trends. Examining relationships between new alien species arrivals data since 1929 against global temperatures, it is shown that their introduction rate parallels the significant increase of marine temperatures. The association of alien introductions with marine water warming, as well as potential effects on ecosystem functioning of selected species is discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Genetic structure and differentiation at a short-time scale of the introduced calcarean sponge Paraleucilla magna to the western Mediterranean},
abstract={Issue Title: Ancient animals, new challenges: developments in sponge research The allochthonous calcarean sponge Paraleucilla magna has proliferated in the western Mediterranean during the last decade, where it currently shows a highly patchy distribution with dense populations in the neighboring of sea farms and slightly eutrophised marinas, and more sparse populations in well-preserved habitats. To gain knowledge about the species invasive capacity, we studied spatial genetic differentiation and structure, clonality, and temporal differentiation, in three close populations of P. magna at the NE of the Iberian Peninsula, in three successive years. The study hypothesis was that the species is able to proliferate under favorable conditions in newly colonized habitats but populations can easily disappear where perturbations occur with some frequency. Samples were genotyped for nine polymorphic microsatellites. Spatial genetic structure was found in the three populations of 2006. One population disappeared in 2007, and the other two remained slightly differentiated, while the three populations were in place again in 2008, and showed very low (but significant) F ^sub ST^ values, and non-significant D values. Low but statistically significant differentiation also occurred for the three populations between years. Results showed high-allele diversity, but heterozygote deficit and changes in allele frequencies in the populations over the 3<c2><a0>years, which are consistent with some genetic drift. The whole population descriptors pointed to the species as a good opportunistic colonizer as it has been hypothesized, but highly sensitive to stochastic events affecting recruitment. This suggests a high impact of the species in favorable habitats (sea culture and sheltered zones) and a low-medium influence in native communities.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={A 12-month active biomonitoring study was performed in 2008-2009 on the Vesle river basin (Champagne-Ardenne, France) using the freshwater mussel Dreissena polymorpha as a sentinel species; allochthonous mussels originating from a reference site (Commercy) were exposed at four sites (Bouy, Sept-Saulx, Fismes, Ardre) within the Vesle river basin. Selected core biomarkers (acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, glutathione-S transferase (GST) activity, metallothionein concentration), along with digestive enzyme activities (amylase, endocellulase) and energy reserve concentrations (glycogen, lipids), were monitored throughout the study in exposed mussels. At the Fismes and Ardre sites (downstream basin), metallic and organic contamination levels were low but still high enough to elicit AChE and GST activity induction in exposed mussels (chemical stress); besides, chemical pollutants had no apparent deleterious effects on mussel condition. At the Bouy and Sept-Saulx sites (upstream basin), mussels obviously suffered from adverse food conditions which seriously impaired individual physiological state and survival (nutritional stress); food scarcity had however no apparent effects on core biomarker responses. Digestive enzyme activities responded to both chemical and nutritional stresses, the increase in energy outputs (general adaptation syndrome--downstream sites) or the decrease in energy inputs (food scarcity--upstream sites) leading to mid- or long-term induction of digestive carbohydrase activities in exposed mussels (energy optimizing strategy). Complex regulation patterns of these activities require nevertheless the use of a multi-marker approach to allow data interpretation. Besides, their sensitivity to natural confounding environmental factors remains to be precised.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Habitat complexity: approaches and future directions},
abstract={Issue Title: The importance of habitat complexity in waterscapes Habitat complexity is one of the most important factors structuring biotic assemblages, yet we still lack basic understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Although it is one of the primary targets in conservation management, no methods are available for comparing complexity across ecosystems, and system-specific qualitative assessment predominates. Despite its overwhelming importance for faunal diversity and abundance, there has been surprisingly little interest in examining its effects on other community and ecosystem attributes. We discuss possibilities of such effects, outlining potentially fruitful areas for future research, and argue that complexity may be implicated in community persistence and ecosystem stability by acting as a decoupling mechanism in predator-prey interactions. We provide a brief overview of methods used to quantify complexity in different ecosystems, highlighting contributions of the current issue of Hydrobiologia, and discuss potential application of these approaches for cross-ecosystem comparisons. Better understanding of the role of habitat complexity resulting from such comparisons is critically important for preservation of biodiversity and ecosystem function in an era of unprecedented habitat loss.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={The role of intracontinental migration patterns of European eel (Anguilla anguilla) receives more and more recognition in both ecological studies of the European eel and possible management measures, but small-scale patterns proved to be challenging to study. We experimentally investigated the suitability of fatty acid trophic markers to elucidate the utilization of feeding habitats. Eight groups of juvenile European eels were fed on eight different diets in a freshwater recirculation system at 20<c2><b0>C for 56<c2><a0>days. Three groups were fed on freshwater diets (Rutilus rutilus, Chironomidae larvae, and Gammarus pulex) and four groups were reared on diets of a marine origin (Clupea harengus, Crangon crangon, Mysis spec., and Euphausia superba) and one on commercial pellets used in eel aquaculture. Fatty acid composition (FAC) of diets differed significantly with habitat. FAC of eel muscle tissue seemed to be rather insensitive to fatty acids supplied with diet, but the general pattern of lower n3:n6 and EPA:ARA ratios in freshwater prey organisms could be traced in the respective eels. Multivariate statistics of the fatty acid composition of the eels resulted in two distinct groups representing freshwater and marine treatments. Results further indicate the capability of selectively restraining certain fatty acids in eel, as e.g. the n3:n6 ratio in all treatments was <4, regardless of dietary n3:n6. In future studies on wild eel, these measures can be used to elucidate the utilization of feeding habitats of individual European eel.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the sixth top-selling drugs worldwide and are commonly found in freshwater ecosystems in the high ng/l to low <ce><bc>g/l range. Recent studies have investigated both the acute and the chronic toxicity of single NSAIDs on different biological models, but these studies have completely neglected the fact that, in the environment, non-target organisms are exposed to mixtures of drugs that have unforeseeable toxicological behavior. This work investigated the sub-lethal effects induced by a mixture of three common NSAIDs, namely, diclofenac, ibuprofen and paracetamol, on the freshwater bivalve, the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha). The mussels were exposed to three different environmental concentrations of the mixture (Low, Mid and High). A multi-biomarker approach was used to highlight cyto-genotoxic effects and the imbalance of the oxidative status of the treated specimens. The Neutral Red Retention Assay (NRRA) was used as a biomarker of cytotoxicity, whereas the activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione S-transferase were measured to assess the role played by the oxidative stress enzymes. In addition, the single cell gel electrophoresis assay, the DNA Diffusion assay and the micronucleus test were used to investigate possible genotoxic effects. According to our NRRA results, each treatment was able to induce a significant cellular stress in bivalves, probably due to the raise of oxidative stress, as indicated by the alteration of enzyme activities measured in treated specimens. Moreover, the mixture induced significant enhancements of DNA fragmentation, which preluded fixed genetic damage, as highlighted by the increase of both apoptotic and micronucleated cells.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

The present investigation evaluated effects of nickel contamination and parasitism (ciliates Ophryoglena spp. and intracellular bacteria Rickettsiales-like organisms), alone and in combination, on biological responses of the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha, and also the infestation abilities of parasites, under laboratory controlled conditions. Results showed that after 48<c2><a0>h, more organisms were infected in nickel-exposed groups, which could be related to weakening of their immune system. Acting separately, nickel contamination and infections were already stressful conditions; however, their combined action caused stronger biological responses in zebra mussels. Our data, therefore, confirm that the parasitism in D. polymorpha represents a potential confounding factor in ecotoxicological studies that involve this bivalve.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Invasion by mobile aquatic consumers enhances secondary production and increases top-down control of lower trophic levels},
abstract={Increased biological diversity due to invasion by non-indigenous species (NIS) is a global phenomenon with potential effects on trophic interactions and ecosystem processes in the invaded habitat. We assessed the effects of resource availability and invasion of three non-indigenous invertebrate grazers (two crustaceans and a snail) on secondary production, relative dominance of NIS grazers and resource depletion in experimental freshwater mesocosms. The relative dominance of NIS grazers increased with increasing initial resource availability, although the effect was largest for one of the three species. The effect was due to the fact that all the included non-indigenous grazers were able to expand their populations quickly in response to resource addition. For the most dominating species, the increased grazer diversity due to invasion in turn resulted in higher production of grazer biomass and a more efficient depletion of the periphyton resource. The effect was largest at high initial resource availability, where NIS dominance was most pronounced. Our results show that an invasion-induced increase in species diversity can increase resource depletion and consequently production, but that the effect depends on identity of the introduced species. The results also suggest that properties of the recipient system, such as resource availability, can modulate ecosystem effects of NIS by affecting invader success and dominance.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Slow, but steady: dispersal of freshwater molluscs},
abstract={Molluscs are the proverbial examples of slow movement. In this review, dispersal distances and speed were assessed from literature data. Active upstream movement can occur both individually and in groups; and depends on traits such as size, sex and reproductive status, and on external factors such as flow velocity, temperature, sediment structure, and food availability. The potential for active dispersal follows the sequence Pulmonata<c2><a0><e2><89><a5><c2><a0>Prosobranchia<c2><a0>><c2><a0>Bivalvia, although data for Pulmonata originated from short-term experiments that likely overestimated dispersal capabilities. Active upstream movement may be 0.3 to 1.0<c2><a0>km per year for most snails and is probably well below 0.1<c2><a0>km per year for bivalves. Natural passive upstream dispersal increases the range 10-fold (snails) to 100-fold (bivalves), and anthropogenic vectors can increase upstream dispersal more than 100-fold (snails) to 1000-fold (bivalves). Three km seems to be the maximal within-stream distance at which many species display regular population mixing, and at which re-colonisation or successful restoration can be expected within 3-10<c2><a0>years. Lateral dispersal between unconnected water bodies is passive and mostly known from observational reports, but potential distances depend on vectors, climate and geomorphology. In general, active dispersal seems insufficient to furnish a compensatory mechanism, e.g., for the rate of projected climate change. We provide an overview on dispersal strategies in the light of applied issues. More rigorous field surveys and an integration of different approaches (such as mark-recapture, genetic) to quantify distances and probabilities of lateral dispersal are needed to predict species distributions across space and time.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={The spread of alien molluscs is a serious threat to native biodiversity in fresh waters. Alien freshwater molluscs may deplete the resources of native species and alter the physical structure of the habitat through their shell mass. These changes might have both positive and negative effects on native community members. We investigated the native macroinvertebrate community in relation to the densities of four alien mollusc species (Corbicula fluminea, Dreissena polymorpha, Potamopyrgus antipodarum and Lithoglyphus naticoides) in a sandy flat of Lake Neuch<c3><a2>tel, Switzerland. The habitat examined was dominated by these alien mollusc species. The abundance of the alien molluscs did not directly impact the native community assembly. However, C.<c2><a0>fluminea and D. polymorpha influenced the composition and diversity of native macroinvertebrates by transforming the sandy substratum into a partly hard substratum habitat. Substantial differences in community composition between shallow (<3.5<c2><a0>m) and (<e2><89><a5>5<c2><a0>m) deep sites were recorded. At shallow sites, the abundance of D. polymorpha was significantly reduced as a result of depth-selective feeding of ducks. A controlled shell decay study revealed that shells of alien molluscs (C. fluminea, D. polymorpha) persist for a longer period in the sediment than those of native molluscs. Consequently, shells of alien molluscs have a long-lasting impact by modifying the sandy habitat. This form of ecosystem engineering favours the occurrence of several native taxa, but is disadvantageous for other taxa with specific habitat requirements, and thus can be regarded as an indirect impact of competition.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={To understand interactions of lake physical characteristics, trophic dynamics and climate in Lago Maggiore, we compare longterm limnological and meteorological monitoring data and results from sediment cores. We include analyses of nutrients, pigments, diatoms and cladoceran microfossils. Over the past decades, caloric content increased. Eutrophication from the 1960s to early 1980s was followed by oligotrophication. DDTs, PCBs and Hg showed high contamination in the <e2><80><98>60s, compared to point source inputs in the <e2><80><98>90s. Algal biomass was predicted by total pigments and some algal specific carotenoids. Following nutrient enrichment, Chydorus sphaericus, and total abundance of cladocerans changed inversely with trophic status. Fewer large Daphnia since the late <e2><80><98>80s matched an increase in with subfossil Eubosmina mucro lengths. Both were explained by the 10-fold increase in Bythotrephes longimanus from 1987 to 1993, when an increase of its mean annual population density occurred during warmer winter and springs. Bythotrephes remained abundant and further increased during the following 10 years as water temperature increased. We conclude that warmer water affects food chains indirectly by changing habitat use and predator-prey interactions. Relative abundances of Daphnia and its peak population density in the warm year of the oligotrophic period (2003) were close to the record from the mesotrophic period in 1982, supporting the hypothesis that warming can produce a eutrophication-like signal. The study illustrates the complexity of biological responses to synchronous changes in multiple drivers (e.g., eutrophication, fish introduction, ban of fish harvesting, chemical pollution, and climate) and, despite this complexity, how Lago Maggiore responded to multiple stressors.},

The golden mussel alters both the structure and function of benthic native communities on hard substrates, allows a higher surface available for colonization and refuge, and provides food source to deposit-feeding organisms in the form of organic or residual material. The mussel also increases the abundance and diversity of taxa on hard substrata - such as Oligochaeta, Hirudinea, Tardigrada, Chironomidae, Copepoda, Tanaidacea, and Hydrachnidia. Similarities and nonparametric multidimensional-scaling analyses indicated that the benthic composition had a seasonal variation.

This vision reflected the ecological challenges of the time and a desire to move forward on objectives commonly held by the commission and various government and non-government stakeholders. Non-native species began to appear in the Great Lakes in the 1800s. Completion of the Erie Canal in 1825 opened the way west for settlement, but also opened a more southerly connection from the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes. The alewife and the sea lamprey were among the first and most successful invaders to use this connection.},

title={Effect of water velocity on growth and retention of cultured Greenshell(TM) mussel spat, Perna canaliculus (Gmelin, 1791)},
abstract={The Greenshell^sup TM^ mussel, Perna canaliculus, is a commercially important species forming New Zealand's largest aquaculture export product. Losses of P. canaliculus spat from culture ropes between larval settlement and the time mussels reach initial reseeding size (c. 10<c2><a0>mm) are common. To test whether water velocity affects growth and retention of post-settlement P. canaliculus spat, and whether there is a threshold effect of increasing velocities on spat migration, a laboratory-based experiment was conducted. Spat were grown for 8<c2><a0>weeks in experimental tanks on culture ropes at four velocities typical of velocities within mussel farms (40, 10, 4, and 1<c2><a0>cm<c2><a0>s^sup -1^). Spat migration was observed at all the velocities tested, but the number of spat migrating decreased as water velocity increased. Spat retention was highest at the 40<c2><a0>cm<c2><a0>s^sup -1^ velocity. Mean spat size increased significantly with increasing water velocity. At the highest velocity tested (40<c2><a0>cm<c2><a0>s^sup -1^), migration increased as the spat grew suggesting that migration was density-driven. The results of this experiment indicate the potential for mussel farmers to reduce seeded spat loss and to increase the growth rate of spat by modification of the water flow within their farms, or placement of seeded ropes in locations of certain existing water velocities, and indicate that velocities in the range 15-40<c2><a0>cm<c2><a0>s^sup -1^ promote higher spat growth and spat retention for P. canaliculus.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Spatial and temporal variabilities of [delta]^sup 13^C and [delta]^sup 15^N within lower trophic levels of a large lake: implications for estimating trophic relationships of consumers},
abstract={Stable isotopes of carbon (<ce><b4>^sup 13^C) and nitrogen (<ce><b4>^sup 15^N) often have unique values among lake habitats (e.g. benthic, littoral, pelagic), providing a widely used tool for measuring the structure and energy flow in aquatic food webs. However, there has been little recognition of the spatial and temporal variabilities of these isotopes within habitats of aquatic ecosystems. To address this, <ce><b4>^sup 13^C and <ce><b4>^sup 15^N were measured in seston, zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) and young-of-year (YOY) yellow (Perca flavescens), and white perch (Morone americana) collected from four sites across the offshore habitat of the western basin of Lake Erie during June-September 2009. Values of <ce><b4>^sup 13^C and <ce><b4>^sup 15^N showed significant spatial and temporal variations, with month accounting for >50% of the variation, for both stable isotopes and all the species except seston. Such variation in isotope values has the potential to significantly influence or confound interpretation of stable isotopes in measures, such as trophic position (TP) which use lower trophic level organisms as their baseline. For example, TP was found to vary up to 0.7 for yellow and white perch (TP<c2><a0>=<c2><a0><ce><b4>^sup 15^N^sub fish^<c2><a0>-<c2><a0><ce><b4>^sup 15^N^sub zebra mussel^/diet-tissue fractionation factor) depending on the zebra mussel data used (e.g., from a different location or a different collection month). As the use of stable isotopes continues to move from qualitative to more quantitative measures of trophic structure, food web research must recognize the importance of stable isotopes' variability in lower trophic level organisms, especially in large lake systems.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Effects of desiccation on two life stages of an invasive snail and its native cohabitant},
abstract={Invasive species are of critical concern as they have the potential to rapidly alter biotic systems around the globe. The upper Mississippi River (UMR) system has been recently invaded by the aquatic snail, Bithynia tentaculata, which spread from the Great Lakes region. In addition to potentially impacting native aquatic snails, B. tentaculata also carries three parasites which kill thousands of migrating waterfowl annually. Although this invader is having detrimental impacts on a number of species in the UMR region, little is known regarding (1) the tolerances of B. tentaculata to abiotic stresses in this area, and (2) how stress thresholds in this species compare to native species across developmental stages. To help fill in these informational gaps, we conducted a series of laboratory experiments aimed at assessing the tolerances of B. tentaculata and a native snail (Physa gyrina) to desiccation at two stages of ontogeny (eggs and adults). Results showed that P. gyrina egg masses were more tolerant to a transient desiccation period (9<c2><a0>h) than B. tentaculata egg masses as evidenced by their higher hatching success. Conversely, adult survival in B. tentaculata was much greater than that of P. gyrina after a longer desiccation period (1<c2><a0>week). Although superior tolerance to drying varies between the developmental stages of each species, B. tentaculata may have an overall advantage due to its ability to endure prolonged drying at maturity. These results suggest that hydrologic fluctuations in the UMR may contribute to reductions in P. gyrina numbers, potentially facilitating B. tentaculata colonization and the spread of waterfowl infections.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Population Dynamics of Lake Ontario Lake Trout during 1985-2007},
abstract={Lake trout Salvelinus namaycush were extirpated from Lake Ontario circa 1950 owing to commercial and recreational fishing, predation by sea lampreys Petromyzon marinus, and habitat degradation. Since the 1970s, substantial efforts have been devoted to reestablishing a self-sustaining population through stocking, sea lamprey control, and harvest reduction. Although a stocking-supported population has been established, only limited natural reproduction has been detected. Since the 1990s, surveys have indicated a continuing decline in overall abundance despite fairly static stocking levels. We constructed a statistical catch-at-age model to describe the dynamics of Lake Ontario lake trout from 1985 to 2007 and explore what factor(s) could be causing the declines in abundance. Model estimates indicated that abundance had declined by approximately 76% since 1985. The factor that appeared most responsible for this was an increase in age-1 natural mortality rates from approximately 0.9 to 2.5 between 1985 and 2002. The largest source of mortality for age-2 and older fish was sea lamprey predation, followed by natural and recreational fishing mortality. Exploitation was low, harvest levels being uncertain and categorized by length rather than age. Accurate predictions of fishery harvest and survey catch per unit effort were obtained despite low harvest levels by using atypical data (e.g., numbers stocked as an absolute measure of recruitment) and a flexible modeling approach. Flexible approaches such as this might allow similar assessments for a wide range of lightly exploited stocks. The mechanisms responsible for declining age-1 lake trout survival are unknown, but the declines were coincident with an increase in the proportion of stocked fish that were of the Seneca strain and a decrease in the overall stocking rate. It is possible that earlier studies suggesting that Seneca strain lake trout would be successful in Lake Ontario are no longer applicable given the large ecosystem changes that have occurred subsequent to invasion by dreissenid mussels.

title={The effectiveness of the induced anti-predator behaviour of zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha in the presence of molluscivorous roach Rutilus rutilus},
abstract={We checked whether the induced anti-predator defences of zebra mussels are able to affect the predation success of roach, being one of the most efficient zebra mussel predators in Europe. Previously, several anti-predator defences of mussels have been observed in the presence of roach, including stronger attachment, aggregation forming and inhibition of upward movement. However, the actual efficiency of these responses to reduce the mussel vulnerability to predation was unknown. To check the effectiveness of attachment strength, we exposed mussels for 6 (strong attachment), 1 (weak attachment) or 0 (unattached) days in ceramic trays and then presented the trays to fish in an experimental tank. To test the effectiveness of aggregation, we glued mussels to the trays in groups of three (touching one another) or singly using denture glue and exposed them to fish. To check the effect of the vertical position, we glued mussels with denture glue to the bottom and 10, 20 and 30<c2><a0>cm above the bottom of the tank with fish. After 1-h exposure, we determined the percentages of consumed mussels. Roach predation rate was lowest on strongly attached mussels, intermediate on weakly attached mussels and highest on unattached mussels. Aggregated mussels were less frequently consumed than singletons. Conversely, the vertical position of mussels did not affect the roach predation success. Our study demonstrates that the behavioural defences exhibited by zebra mussels can increase their survival in the presence of predators and thus emphasizes the importance of the anti-predator behaviour of this species.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Polychaete invader enhances resource utilization in a species-poor system},
abstract={Ecosystem consequences of biodiversity change are often studied from a species loss perspective, while the effects of invasive species on ecosystem functions are rarely quantified. In this experimental study, we used isotope tracers to measure the incorporation and burial of carbon and nitrogen from a simulated spring phytoplankton bloom by communities of one to four species of deposit-feeding macrofauna found in the species-poor Baltic Sea. The recently invading polychaete Marenzelleria arctia, which has spread throughout the Baltic Sea, grows more rapidly than the native species Monoporeia affinis, Pontoporeia femorata (both amphipods) and Macoma balthica (a bivalve), resulting in higher biomass increase (biomass production) in treatments including the polychaete. Marenzelleria incorporated and buried bloom material at rates similar to the native species. Multi-species treatments generally had higher isotope incorporation, indicative of utilization of bloom material, than expected from monoculture yields of the respective species. The mechanism behind this observed over-yielding was mainly niche complementarity in utilization of the bloom input, and was more evident in communities including the invader. In contrast, multi-species treatments had generally lower biomass increase than expected. This contrasting pattern suggests that there is little overlap in resource use of freshly deposited bloom material between Marenzelleria and the native species but it is likely that interference competition acts to dampen resulting community biomass. In conclusion, an invasive species can enhance incorporation and burial of organic matter from settled phytoplankton blooms, two processes fundamental for marine productivity.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Sympatric variability of isotopic baselines influences modeling of fish trophic patterns},
abstract={Stable isotope signatures of freshwater snails and mussels have been established as a convenient baseline measurement at the primary consumer level for food-web coupling studies. We measured <ce><b4>^sup 15^N and <ce><b4>^sup 13^C of primary consumers, including mussels (Anodonta woodiana, Cristaria plicata, and Unio douglasiae), snails (Bellamya aeruginosa and Hippeutis sp.), and zooplankton from the same habitat within a shallow eutrophic lake. Primary consumers showed positive relationship between <ce><b4>^sup 15^N and <ce><b4>^sup 13^C, indicating a linkage between planktonic and benthic habitats in this system. The variation in isotope ratios was higher in short-lived primary consumers (zooplankton) compared with the long-lived primary consumers (mussels and snails), suggesting limited availability of short-lived primary consumers as isotopic baselines in aquatic food-web assessment. Significant differences in isotope ratios were also found among three species of mussels, and when using these mussels separately as pelagic baselines to calculate trophic position and contribution of planktonic and benthic sources of fishes, bias and even misestimates were observed. This finding suggests that caution is needed when multiple primary consumers coexist in the same habitat, and it is important to assess potential effects of different baselines used.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Investigation of the genetic diversity of an invasive whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) in China using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA markers},
abstract={Abstract It is often considered that reduced genetic variation due to bottlenecks and founder effects limits the capacity for species to establish in new environments and subsequently spread. The recent invasion (during the past five years) of an alien whitefly, one member of Bemisia tabaci cryptic species complex, referred to as Mediterranean (herein referred to as Q-type) in Shandong Province, China, provides an ideal opportunity to study the changes in genetic variation between its home range in the Mediterranean region and its invasion range. Using both the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (mtCOI) and nuclear (microsatellite) DNA, we show that Q in Shandong likely originated in the western Mediterranean. We also found that the haplotype diversity was low compared with its presumed geographic origin, whereas microsatellite allele diversity showed no such decline. A key factor in invasions is the establishment of females and so bottleneck and founder events can lead to a very rapid and considerable loss of mitochondrial diversity. The lack of haplotype diversity in Shandong supports the interpretation that, at one or more points between the western Mediterranean and China, the invading Q lost haplotype diversity, most probably through the serial process of establishment and redistribution through trade in ornamental plants. However, the loss in haplotype diversity does not necessarily mean that nuclear allelic diversity should also decline. Provided females can mate freely with whichever males are available, allelic diversity can be maintained or even increased relative to the origin of the invader. Our findings may offer some explanation to the apparent paradox between the concept of reduced genetic variation limiting adaptation to new environments and the observed low diversity in successful invaders.

title={Occupation, body size and sex ratio of round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) in established and newly invaded areas of an Ontario river},
abstract={Invasive species represent a challenge because the particular characteristics of a species' invasion are often unknown before the invasion. To provide some clarity as to how invasive species demographic structure might change as a population advances its range, we compared the proportion of occupied sites, size structure and sex ratio of round gobies in the area where they first invaded with more recently invaded areas at the extent of their range in a river in south-eastern Ontario. We used a standardized angling technique to sample gobies larger than 45-mm total length in the summer and early autumn of 2007. Round goby at the upstream and downstream extent of their range occupied a lower proportion of randomly selected sites, and contained a wider distribution of sizes as well as significantly larger individuals. Sex ratios in all areas were male-biased and the male-to-female ratio was significantly higher in the upstream segment of the river (2.2:1) compared to the area of first introduction (1.4:1). The difference between the newly invaded and the established sites suggests that round goby population structure may be affected by density. The results of this study help us further describe the demographic characteristics of biological invasions whilst examples of population structure and behaviour in gobies and other species provide a basis for generating hypotheses for range expansion.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Survey and management of mussel Mytilus species in Scotland},
abstract={The important ecological role of Mytilus mussels in marine ecosystems, their high abundance in coastal waters and the demand for human consumption has made them a target species for aquaculture. Mussel cultivation is the most important and rapidly growing sector of the Scottish shellfish aquaculture industry and until recently production was considered to be based exclusively on the native species Mytilus edulis. However, the sympatric occurrence of M. edulis, M. trossulus, M. galloprovincialis and their hybrids in cultivation has recently been reported and significant production losses (over 50% at some sites) have been attributed to the presence of fragile-shelled M. trossulus. Given the ecological and economical importance of these species, an urgent need arose for a wider understanding of Mytilus species distribution on Scottish coasts and its implication for the sustainability of the Scottish shellfish industry. Here we present a summary of a 3-year project established within the "ECOsystem approach to SUstainable Management of the Marine Environment and its living Resources" (ECOSUMMER) Marie Curie network to address this need. We developed DNA-based molecular assays for the detection and surveillance of the different Mytilus species in Scotland. Several potential management strategies have been explored, aimed at favouring M. edulis production at mixed-species sites, but these have so far not been found to provide the reliable efficacy necessary for adoption by the industry. Complete eradication of M. trossulus from economically affected areas in Scotland may be unrealistic, especially considering that its introduction and distribution mechanisms in the environment remain uncertain. Area-specific solutions to managing the problem may thus be required, which may or may not involve eradication and fallowing (clearance of mussels from production sites for a given period of time). Nevertheless, the current distribution of M. trossulus is limited and its spread outside its existing range is clearly undesirable. Any management solutions must also be accompanied by an industry wide strategy and awareness, for example, through the development of an industry supported code of good practice.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Methods for sampling and analysis of marine microalgae in ship ballast tanks: a case study from Tampa Bay, Florida, USA},
abstract={Ballasting and deballasting of shipping vessels in foreign ports have been reported worldwide as a vector of introduction of non-native aquatic plants and animals. Recently, attention has turned to ballast water as a factor in the global increase of harmful algal blooms (HABs). Many species of microalgae, including harmful dinoflagellate species, can remain viable for months in dormant benthic stages (cysts) in ballast sediments. Over a period of four years, we surveyed ballast water and sediment of ships docked in two ports of Tampa Bay, Florida, USA. Sampling conditions encountered while sampling ballast water and sediments were vastly different between vessels. Since no single sample collection protocol could be applied, existing methods for sampling ballast were modified and new methods created to reduce time and labor necessary for the collection of high-quality, qualitative samples. Five methods were refined or developed, including one that allowed for a directed intake of water and sediments. From 63 samples, 1,633 dinoflagellate cysts and cyst-like cells were recovered. A native, cyst-forming, harmful dinoflagellate, Alexandrium balechii (Steidinger) F. J. R. Taylor, was collected, isolated, and cultured from the same vessel six months apart, indicating that ships exchanging ballast water in Tampa Bay have the potential to transport HAB species to other ports with similar ecologies, exposing them to non-native, potentially toxic blooms.

title={Suspended material availability and filtration-biodeposition processes performed by a native and invasive bivalve species in streams},
abstract={Unionid mussels are among the most threatened group of freshwater organisms globally. They are known for their ability to filter food particles from flowing and standing waters. However, invasive bivalve species, such as the Asian clam (Corbicula fluminea) in North America, have the potential to overlap in feeding and potentially out-compete the native species. Yet, the feeding preferences of unionid mussels and C. fluminea are incompletely understood. We hypothesized that Elliptio crassidens (native) and C. fluminea (invasive) would select for specific organic components present within seston. We examined changes in seston (dry mass and ash-free dry mass) resulting from bivalve feeding activity for three size classes of material that were isolated using gravimetric filtration. The treatments were also sub-sampled for flow cytometry (FC) which separated the suspended materials in the stream water into five categories: detritus, heterotrophic bacteria, picoautotrophs, nanoautotrophs, and heterotrophic nanoeukaryotes. Our results indicated that both species of bivalve showed preferences for organic and living materials. E. crassidens preferentially filtered nanoeukaryotes, whose decreases were associated with an increase in bacteria. In contrast, C. fluminea preferred smaller materials through selective filtration of picoautotrophs. In addition, both species increased the concentration of large materials toward the end of the experiment because of the suspension of their pseudofeces biodeposits. To our knowledge, this study is the first to examine grazing by bivalve species on natural stream particulate matter using FC. Our results suggest that native and non-native mussels have different functional roles, which has important implications for organic matter processing and food webs in streams.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Moreover, the activity of catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and the phase II detoxifying enzyme glutathione S-transferase was measured in the cytosolic fraction extracted from a pool of entire bivalves to reveal possible alterations of the oxidative status of exposed specimens. The biomarker battery pointed out a negligible cyto- and genotoxicity on zebra mussel hemocytes since only a slight decrease of lysosomal membrane stability from baseline levels was measured at the end of exposures at the highest concentration (2<c2><a0>nM). In addition, environmental concentrations of DCF seem to have a negligible effect on the activities of antioxidant and detoxifying enzymes. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={One of the aims of the Water Framework Directive 2000/60/CE is to assess the ecological status of water bodies in Europe in relation to priority contaminants, including some persistent organic pollutants (POP). Recognizing the benefits of measuring hydrophobic compounds in biota tissues rather than in water, we used the European eel Anguilla anguilla in the present study as a bioindicator species for monitoring POPs in freshwater/brackish environments. We present the results of a contamination analysis of eels carried out in three Italian sites representative of different pollution levels: the last part of Tevere River, which flows through a very urbanized and industrialized area, Caprolace Lake and Lesina Lagoon, inside two different protected national parks. A very high pollution variability was recorded within each group of eels, in particular for those caught at Caprolace Lake. Due to this high variability, inter-population comparisons were carried out only between eels collected in Tevere River and Lesina Lagoon. PCBs values in Lesina Lagoon were two orders of magnitude lower than those measured in Tevere River, while no significant differences were found for levels of DDT compounds. Our results confirm the suitability of the eel as an indicator of persistent bioaccumulative pollutants in brackish environments and rivers where it can be easily caught, but we are sceptical of its use in deep lakes where its capture might be problematic considering standard operation procedures for fish sampling.

title={Differences in Relative Predation Vulnerability Between Native and Non-native Oyster Larvae and the Influence on Restoration Planning in an Estuarine Ecosystem},
abstract={The costs and benefits of non-native introductions as a restoration tool should be estimated prior to any action to prevent both undesirable consequences and waste of restoration resources. The suggested introduction of non-native oyster species, Crassostrea ariakensis, into Chesapeake Bay, USA, provides a good example in which the survival of non-native oysters may differ from that of native oysters, Crassostrea virginica, during the larval stage. Experiments were conducted to compare the predation vulnerability of native and non-native oyster larvae to different predator types (visual vs. non-visual, benthic vs. pelagic). The results suggest that the non-native larvae are more vulnerable to visual and non-visual pelagic predators. Although vulnerability was similar for larvae exposed to benthic non-visual predators, the consumption of one non-native strain was higher than the consumption of native C. virginica larvae. When vulnerability data are combined with predator feeding rates, the predation mortality for non-native larvae in the wild can be much higher than for native larvae. Small changes in larval mortality rates can yield large changes in total larval delivery to the reef for settlement, so these differences among species may contribute to differences in settlement success. These results provide an example of how a comprehensive examination of the perceived benefits of non-native introductions into complex ecosystems can provide important information to inform management decisions.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={In economically developed countries it is projected that by around 2015 over 50% of a person's lifetime will become available for leisure. Demand for leisure needs, already strong, will continue to increase. One segment of the market, outdoor nature-based recreation (including tourism), is growing strongly worldwide. A substantial proportion of these activities are water-based. The associated demand for recreational vessels has increased rapidly in recent years and is projected to continue to trend upwards. Australian trends mirror those internationally. Using Australia as a case study, we review the direct physical, chemical and biotic impacts associated with recreational boating in coastal water environments. Major physical impacts include disturbance due to movement of craft in shallow waters (e.g., turbulence) and the effects of anchoring/drag, noise/interference/collision that impacts on wildlife. The most critical chemical impacts result from pollution due to fuels and oils, defouling treatments (even those not legislated in-country), and human waste (e.g., sewage effluent). Important biotic impacts are the potential continued introduction and secondary spread of non-native species. We conclude that while greater research effort will provide more environmentally benign products, with the increasing popularity of recreation vessels, it will be beyond the resources of Australian governments to police legislation effectively. However, based on Australian's demonstrated engagement with government in terrestrial environmental management, with their deliberate engagement with the boating fraternity, the impacts of recreational boating would be lessened.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Using long-term monitoring to investigate the changes in species composition in the harbour of Ghent (Belgium)},
abstract={The macroinvertebrate community of the harbour of Ghent was studied by analysing 135 samples taken at different sampling locations from 1990 until 2008. The results showed that the current Crustacea and Mollusca communities are mainly represented, in terms of abundances, by alien species. In total, seven alien and four indigenous crustacean species were found. Mollusc diversity was higher, with a total of 14 species, four of which were alien. Macroinvertebrate diversity was very low at the beginning of the 1990s, but increased due to the improvement of the chemical water quality achieved by sanitation and stricter environmental laws. This is reflected by the dissolved oxygen concentration, which increased from an average of 2<c2><a0>mg/l to an average of 9<c2><a0>mg/l, allowing more sensitive species to establish. Since 1993, the number of alien taxa has augmented, whereas the number of native taxa has remained stable. The improvement of the chemical water quality and the simultaneous increase in total number of species were also reflected in an increase of the Multimetric Macroinvertebrate Index Flanders, which is used to assess the ecological water quality in Flanders. Due to intensive international boat traffic and the low species diversity, the harbour of Ghent is highly vulnerable for invasions. Stronger regulations and a better understanding about the contribution of shipping, shortcuts via artificial water ways, habitat degradation and environmental pollution are required to reduce the further spread of alien species.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Population genetic structure of the round goby in Lake Michigan: implications for dispersal of invasive species},
abstract={Understanding subsequent dispersal of non-native species following introduction is important for predicting the extent and speed of range expansion and is critical for effective management and risk assessment. Post-introduction dispersal may occur naturally or via human transport, but assessing the relative contribution of each is difficult for many organisms. Here, we use data from seven microsatellite markers to study patterns of dispersal and gene flow among 12 pierhead populations of the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) in Lake Michigan. We find significant population structure among sampling sites within this single Great Lake: (1) numerous populations exhibited significant pairwise F ^sub ST^ and (2) a Bayesian assignment analysis revealed three distinct genetic clusters, corresponding to different pierhead locations, and genetic admixture between these clusters in the remaining populations. Genetic differentiation (F ^sub ST^) is generally related to geographic distance (i.e., isolation by distance), but is periodically interrupted at the scale of Lake Michigan due to gene flow among geographically distant sites. Moreover, average genetic differentiation among populations exhibit a significant, negative correlation with the amount of shipping cargo at ports. Our results, therefore, provide evidence that genetic structure of the round goby in Lake Michigan results from limited natural dispersal with frequent long-distance dispersal through anthropogenic activities such as commercial shipping. Our study suggests that while round gobies can undoubtedly disperse and found new populations through natural dispersal mechanisms, their spread within and among the Great Lakes is likely aided by transport via ships. We, therefore, recommend that ballast-water treatment and management may limit the spread of non-native species within the Great Lakes after the initial introduction in addition to preventing the introduction of non-native species to the Great Lakes.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Impacts of a Habitat-Forming Exotic Species on Estuarine Structure and Function: An Experimental Assessment of Eurasian Milfoil},
abstract={It is widely believed that successful colonization of ecosystems by non-native species will have catastrophic consequences for the recipient system. Within the Mobile-Tensaw Delta, AL, exotic Eurasian milfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum) has been reported to trigger degradation of ecosystem structure and function. We evaluated the impacts of structurally complex milfoil on food web structure and predator-prey interactions via comparisons with two native grasses, structurally simple wild celery (Vallisneria americana) and the more complex water stargrass (Heteranthera dubia). While significant differences were not detected in the faunal compositions of milfoil and stargrass habitats, significant differences between milfoil and wild celery were found. Laboratory experiments showed that rainwater killifish, a key contributor to these differences, preferred milfoil over wild celery, but did not occupy milfoil more than stargrass. Subsequent experiments indicated that survivorship was drastically lower in wild celery. Though many of the documented impacts of Eurasian milfoil have been cast as detrimental, shelter-seeking organisms may perceive milfoil in the same way as other complex native species.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={The contribution of man-made ditches to the regional stream biodiversity of the new river watershed in the Florida panhandle},
abstract={Issue Title: Lake Restoration: An Experimental Ecosystem Approach for Eutrophication Control / Guest Editors: D.P. Hamilton, M.J. Landman // QuickBird Satellite Imagery as a Tool for Restoration and Rehabilitation of Lake Sevan, Armenia / Guest Editor: Martin A. Stapanian The role of ditches as reservoirs for or contributors to regional diversity has rarely been assessed. In this study, we aimed (1) to assess the effect of ditches on aquatic faunal assemblages of first order streams and (2) to assess the extent to which the animal communities in altered streams that are crossed by ditches resembled those found in nearby natural streams. We examined the fauna of four different aquatic habitats of the New River watershed in the Florida Panhandle: (1) natural streams, (2) altered streams, (3) ditches that cross the altered streams, and (4) ditches that do not cross the altered streams, sampling these habitats in three geographically distinct sites and visiting each location three times during a summer. Ditches did not have the same environmental features as streams and as a result their faunal community did not completely mimic those of natural streams. Streams contained 50% less aquatic vegetation and more canopy cover, while natural streams were more acidic than any other habitat. The connected altered stream and ditch habitats contained the highest biodiversity, while natural streams contained the lowest. Our ordination of taxonomic composition did not reveal any significant differences between habitats. However, natural streams were more likely to contain Hyalella spp., Oligochaetes, and Palaemonetes spp. than other sites, yet did not contain Baetidae spp., Naucorida spp., Trepobate spp., Dolomedes okefinokensis, Leptolucania ommata, or any Centrarcids. These results indicate the importance of ditches within this system as a reservoir for and contributor to regional stream biodiversity and this finding should be taken into consideration by managers for the conservation of the regional freshwater biodiversity.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Differential toxicological effects induced by mercury in gills from three pedigrees of Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum by NMR-based metabolomics},
abstract={Mercury is a hazardous pollutant in the Bohai marine environments due to its high toxicity to the marine organisms and subsequent ecological risk. Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum is one of important sentinel organisms in 'Mussel Watch Program' launched in China and therefore used as a bioindicator in marine and coastal ecotoxicology. There are dominantly distributed three pedigrees of clam (White, Liangdao Red and Zebra) in Yantai population endowed with different tolerances to environmental stressors. In this study, gill tissues were collected from both untreated and mercury exposed White, Liangdao Red and Zebra clams, and the extracts were analyzed by NMR-based metabolomics to compare the original metabolomes and the toxicological effects induced by mercury exposure in three pedigrees. The major abundant metabolites in White clam sample were branched-chain amino acids, lactate, alanine, arginine, acetoacetate, glutamate, succinate, citrate, malonate and taurine, while the metabolite profile of Liangdao Red clam sample comprises relative high levels of alanine, arginine, glutamate, succinate and glycogen. For Zebra clam sample, the metabolite profile exhibited relatively high amount of aspartate, acetylcholine and homarine. After 48<c2><a0>h exposure of 20<c2><a0><ce><bc>g l^sup -1^ Hg^sup 2+^, the metabolic profiles from all the three pedigrees of clams commonly showed significant increases in alanine, arginine, glutamate, aspartate, <ce><b1>-ketoglutarate, glycine and ATP/ADP, and decreases in citrate, taurine and homarine. The unique metabolic differences between the metabolomes of gill tissues from Hg^sup 2+^-exposed White, Liangdao Red and Zebra clams were found, including elevated acetylcholine and branched-chain amino acids in White clams, and the declined succinate in both White and Liangdao Red samples as well as the declined betaine in Zebra and White clams. Overall, our findings showed the differential toxicological responses to mercury exposure and that White clams could be a preferable bioindicator for the metal pollution monitoring based on the metabolic changes from gill compared with other two (Liangdao Red and Zebra) pedigrees of clams.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Recovery Potential Assessment for Rocky Mountain ridged mussel (Gonidea angulata) in British Columbia},
abstract={The Rocky Mountain ridged mussel (RMRM, Gonidea angulata) is a freshwater bivalve mollusc that reaches the northern extent of its global distribution in southern British Columbia. In May 2010 the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) assessed this species as Endangered. Current Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) practice is to undertake a recovery potential assessment when a species is assessed as Endangered or Threatened. RMRM is presently restricted to the Okanagan Basin with small aggregations present in the northeast and southwest areas of Okanagan Lake, in addition to a few individuals encountered in Vaseaux Lake and the Okanagan River. Potential or known threats and their impacts to habitat such as channelization of the Okanagan River, dams and weirs, development of shoreline and littoral zones, pollutants, introduced species such as Eurasian watermilfoil and dreissenid mussels, are evaluated and mitigation measures were recommended. Recommendations for future research are provided in an attempt to fill knowledge gaps and to meet recovery objectives to sustain viable populations and prevent extirpation of the Rocky Mountain ridged mussel in Canada. This Science Advisory Report has resulted from a Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat regional advisory meeting of February 25, 2011 on Recovery Potential Assessment (RPA) of Rocky Mountain Ridged Mussel (Gonidea Angulata) in British Columbia.

title={Spatial Ecology and Population Genetics of Northern Map Turtles (Graptemys geographica) in Fragmented and Continuous Habitats in Canada},
abstract={In riverine systems, the construction of locks and dams may present barriers to movement for aquatic organisms and effectively fragment otherwise continuous populations. We examined the spatial ecology and population genetics of northern map turtles (Graptemys geographica) in the Trent-Severn Waterway (TSW), Ontario, Canada. We hypothesized that the locks and dams on the TSW are fragmenting map turtle habitats and creating barriers to movement, and predicted that turtles from fragmented habitats have significantly reduced home range sizes and daily movements compared to turtles from unfragmented habitats, and that populations on either side of a lock and dam would be genetically distinct. Home ranges and average daily movements were smaller for turtles from fragmented habitats compared with continuous habitats, indicating that locks and dams are restricting mobility. However, populations in fragmented habitats showed none of the predicted genetic consequences of fragmentation (e.g., reduced heterozygosity and allelic richness, differentiation across a barrier). Genetic data may be reflecting historic population structure because only a few turtle generations have passed since the construction of the locks and dams about 100 years ago. Additionally, our genetic data may not be sufficiently robust to detect differentiation at this relatively small geographic scale. Our study highlights the conservation importance of examining multiple facets of a single potential threat, especially for long-lived species that may show differences in short- and long-term effects of fragmentation.

title={Predation and depth effects on abundance and size distribution of an invasive bivalve, the golden mussel Limnoperna fortunei, in a dam reservoir},
abstract={We investigated the predation and depth effects on abundance and size distribution of an invasive freshwater bivalve, Limnoperna fortunei, post-larvae using screened (5-, 25-, and 50-mm mesh openings) and unscreened cages at three depths (6, 12, and 1<c2><a0>m above the bottom) in a dam reservoir, Lake Ohshio of Japan. The densities of L. fortunei on the unscreened cages were much lower than those of the 5-mm mesh screened cages at any depth. The predation rates estimated by dividing the density of the unscreened cage by that of the 5-mm mesh screened cage were 97.3% at 6 m depth, 96.6% at 12 m depth, and 95.8% at the bottom. Shell lengths of L. fortunei post-larvae were small on bottom cages, and their size distribution was significantly different from those at other depths. These results suggest that predation and depth affected the abundance and size distribution of L. fortunei in the lentic environment. The impact of L. fortunei invasion on the food web and the possibility of regulating their population by predation pressures are also discussed.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Preferences of juveniles and adults of the invasive Ponto-Caspian amphipod Pontogammarus robustoides for various species of macrophytes and artificial substrata},
abstract={We studied preferences of invasive Ponto-Caspian amphipod P. robustoides for various macrophyte species (Myriophyllum spicatum, Ceratophyllum demersum, Potamogeton perfoliatus, Elodea canadensis) and artificial plant-like objects (artificial Christmas tree branches) in laboratory pairwise-choice tests. Juvenile (<7<c2><a0>mm) and adult gammarids exhibited different habitat preferences. Adults did not discriminate between artificial and natural substrata, or among most of the tested species of plants. In contrast, juveniles clearly preferred all tested macrophytes over artificial substrata. Moreover, they particularly preferred plants with the finest leaf elements: M. spicatum and C. demersum over the others and E. canadensis over P. perfoliatus. We found no influence of chironomid larvae, a potential food source for adult gammarids, on their distribution, nor any effect of adults on the habitat choice by juveniles. The habitat partitioning between juvenile and adult P. robustoides may help them survive in a new environment and increase their invasive potential by reducing the intraspecific competition and cannibalism.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Native Dreissena freshwater mussels in the Balkans: in and out of ancient lakes},
abstract={The Balkans is a biogeographically highly diverse region and a worldwide hotspot of endemic freshwater diversity. A substantial part of this diversity is attributed to well recognized and potential ancient lakes in its southwestern part. However, despite considerable research efforts, faunal relationships among those lakes are not well understood. Therefore, genetic information from native representatives of the mussel genus Dreissena is here used to test the biogeographical zonation of the southwestern Balkans, to relate demographic changes to environmental changes, to assess the degree of eco-insularity, to reconstruct their evolutionary history, and to explore the potential of native taxa for becoming invasive. Phylogeographical and population genetic analyses indicate that most studied populations belong to two native species: D. presbensis (including the distinct genetic subgroup from Lake Ohrid, ``D. stankovici{''}) and D. blanci. In addition, the first confirmed record of invasive D. polymorpha in the southwestern Balkan is presented. The distribution of native Dreissena spp. generally coincides with the biogeographical zonations previously suggested based on fish data. However, there is disagreement on the assignment of the ancient lakes in the area to respective biogeographical regions. The data for Lake Ohrid are not conclusive. A closer biogeographical connection to lakes of the Vardar region and possibly the northern Ionian region is, however, suggested for Lake Prespa. The reconstruction of the evolutionary history of Dreissena spp. suggests that populations underwent demographic and spatial expansions in the recent past. Expansions started around 320 000-300 000 years ago in ``D. stankovici{''}, 160 000-140 000 years ago in D. blanci, and 110 000-70 000 years ago in D. presbensis. These time frames are discussed within the context of available paleogeological data for lakes Ohrid and Prespa. It is suggested that regional environmental changes may have had pronounced effects on the population histories of native Dreissena spp., though the high buffer capacity of Lake Ohrid may have lessened these effects in ``D. stankovici{''}. In addition, local events influencing individual lakes had very likely considerable effects on the demographic histories of Dreissena spp. as well. The observed patterns of immigration and emigration in and out of ancient lakes may suggest that limited gene flow enabled the survival of few isolated subpopulations and that later on eco-insularity (selective advantages of locally adopted groups) may have prevented excessive hybridization and sympatry of closely related taxa. As for the potential invasiveness of native Dreissena spp., the inferred spatial expansions are not human-mediated and all taxa still appear to be restricted to their native ranges. A concern, however, is that today D. presbensis and D. blanci also occur in artificial water bodies, and that invasive D. polymorpha has reached the area.},

title={Impacts of invasion by Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas, 1771) on the performance of macroinvertebrate assessment tools for eutrophication pressure in lakes},
abstract={Aquatic ecosystems are experiencing increasing disturbance from multiple stressors caused by anthropogenic activities. The potential for multiple stressors to modify each others' impacts is not well understood. Legislation such as the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) requires the development of tools to assess human impacts in aquatic systems that incorporate ecological elements, such as macroinvertebrates. Nutrient enrichment and invasive species are major threats to freshwater systems. The invasive zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha is a conspicuous invader in freshwater aquatic systems in Europe and North America, and has been linked to drastic changes in macroinvertebrate communities and lake ecology. In 31 lake sites varying in nutrient pressure and in the presence or absence of D. polymorpha we tested three ecological quality assessment tools based on macroinvertebrate assemblages (% Sensitive Taxa to Total Phosphorus (TP), TP Score and Indicator Taxa Metric) and two basic ecological metrics. There were highly significant changes in macroinvertebrate diversity, structure, and composition associated with the invasion by D. polymorpha. While the three metrics performed consistently well in non-invaded systems, they lost explanatory power for eutrophication pressure in invaded systems. Our results suggest that metrics may need to be developed separately for invaded and non-invaded systems, and that the interaction between alien species and nutrient enrichment requires further investigation.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={We assessed density, gut fullness and prey composition of round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) from three areas in the Trent River (Ontario) representing areas of initial introduction and subsequent expansion. Round goby had been present at the area of original introduction since 2003, and by 2007/2008, their range had expanded upstream and downstream into the outermost reaches sampled in the study. Catch per unit angling effort in nearshore sites indicated that round goby density in the area of original introduction was more than double their density in the upstream expansion area and nearly three times the density in the downstream expansion area. Gut fullness index was lower in gobies from the area of original introduction than for those at the upstream and downstream edges of their expanded range. The most dramatic difference in diet composition was with dreissenids, where large gobies ([greater than or equal to] 70<c2><a0>mm) occupying the area of original introduction had almost no dreissenid biomass in their guts, whereas dreissenids were the predominant prey type in gobies occupying the two expansion areas. Post-hoc zebra mussel density in the area of original introduction was an order of magnitude lower than in the two expansion areas which, combined with the differences in stomach fullness and prey composition, suggest that local, density-related reduction of this prey type was occurring in the river.

title={Phosphorus-mediated changes in life history traits of the invasive New Zealand mudsnail (Potamopyrgus antipodarum)},
abstract={Understanding the mechanisms that species use to succeed in new environments is vital to predicting the extent of invasive species impacts. Food quality is potentially important because it can affect population dynamics by affecting life history traits. The New Zealand mudsnail, Potamopyrgus antipodarum, is a worldwide invader. We examined how mudsnail growth rate and fecundity responded to the C:P ratio of algal food in laboratory conditions. Mudsnails fed low-P algae (C:P 1,119) grew more slowly, matured later, produced smaller offspring, and grew to a smaller adult size than snails reared on algae with high levels of P. A relatively small increase in algal C:P (203-270) significantly increased mudsnail age at maturity. We suggest that the relatively high body P requirements of mudsnails make them susceptible to allocation trade-offs between growth and reproduction under P-limited conditions. The elemental composition of algae varies greatly in nature, and over half of the rock biofilms in streams surveyed within the introduced range of mudsnails in the Greater Yellowstone Area had C:P ratios above which could potentially pose P limitation of life history traits. High growth rate and fecundity are common traits of many species that become invasive and are also associated with high-P demands. Therefore, fast-growing consumers with high P demands, such as mudsnails, are potentially more sensitive to P limitation suggesting that limitation of growth and reproduction by food quality is an important factor in understanding the resource demands of invasive species.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={The Case of Pollution of Lake Maggiore: a 12-Year Study with the Bioindicator Mussel Dreissena polymorpha},
abstract={In 1996, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) pollution of industrial origin was discovered in Lake Maggiore. It was caused by industrial effluents on a tributary of the River Toce, one of the major affluents of the lake in correspondence of Pallanza Bay. This event is the worst case of environmental pollution that has occurred in Western countries in the last 25<c2><a0>years, not due to agricultural use of DDT, but because of an accidental industrial discharge. Heavy polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) pollution was also noticed in 2002, with concentration levels three to seven times higher than those measured in other Italian subalpine lakes. In this study, the current DDT and PCBs contamination levels were assessed according to their presence in zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) specimens sampled in the last 5<c2><a0>years (2003-2008) in eight sampling stations of Lake Maggiore, chosen to cover the entire perimeter of the basin. Moreover, for two stations (Baveno and Pallanza-Villa Taranto) located inside and outside Pallanza Bay, respectively, it is possible to make comparisons starting from 1996. The results obtained show how Lake Maggiore is still an ecosystem with a severe environmental risk, more than 10<c2><a0>years after the original insecticide discharge. DDT contamination continues to evolve, and natural events, like lake overturn, floods, and heavy rains, can have a great influence on the insecticide levels in the lake. By contrast, PCB contamination is absolutely negligible, even if the peak of pollution revealed in 2002 seems to indicate that these pollutants are still present in large quantities in the Lake Maggiore watershed.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Stomach contents were obtained from 25 Hydromedusa tectifera and 47 Phrynops hilarii that live in syntopy in a pampasic stream in Buenos Aires province, Argentina. Both species are arthropod consumers. Copepods, ostracods, and hemipterans are the preferred items for P. hilarii, and H. tectifera prefers copepods, ostracods, immature dipterans (mainly chironomids), and ephemeropteran larvae. Items that most contribute to the diet of both species are immature chironomids, corixids, and belostomatids. Available food varies little among seasons, being slightly lower in winter months and part of the summer. Diet diversity changes by seasonal variation of prey item abundance in the diet of both species. Diet diversity is higher for P. hilarii (more generalist and broader trophic niche) than in H. tectifera, but there is no niche overlap between them. No significant correlation between the size of turtles and length of prey items was found. There is no evidence that the long neck of H. tectifera relates to piscivorous habits, because fish are a small fraction of its diet and arthropods constitute the bulk of the ingested items.

title={Correlates of vulnerability among arthropod species threatened by invasive ants},
abstract={Invasive species are causing population declines and extinctions of native species worldwide. Correlates of species vulnerability, which help identify at-risk taxa, are not well developed for arthropods, particularly with respect to threats from invasive species. At five sites undergoing invasion by ants in the Hawaiian Islands, we assessed body size, population density, trophic role and provenance (introduced or endemic to the Hawaiian Islands) as potential correlates of vulnerability for 300 arthropod species. Among rare species, provenance was the most important factor associated with absence from invaded plots, with endemic species much more commonly absent. Trophic role was also important, but only when interacting with provenance: endemic carnivores were by far the most vulnerable group, followed by endemic detritivores. For non-rare species, Hawaii endemics were significantly more reduced in invaded plots compared to introduced species. In addition, species that occurred at lower population densities were more vulnerable than those occurring at higher densities. Body size did not correlate with vulnerability for either rare or non-rare species. Despite these trends, there was relatively high variability in responses to invasion among species in many taxonomic orders, as well as among populations of particular species at different sites. While the consideration of additional intrinsic traits might increase predictive ability to some degree (e.g., intrinsic traits only explained 21% of the variation in impact among non-rare species), community-specific extrinsic factors appear to play a large role in influencing outcomes for many species, making prediction substantially more difficult.

title={Recent ecological trends in lower trophic levels of the international section of the St. Lawrence River: a comparison of the 1970s to the 2000s},
abstract={Changes from the 1970s to 2000s in phosphorus and chlorophyll levels, water transparency, zooplankton, and benthic communities in the upper, International Section of the St. Lawrence River were evaluated using trend data from limnological surveys. The influence of Lake Ontario as a source for riverine production was evident in the upper river. Total phosphorus levels from 1976 to 1978 (average ~20 mcg/l) sampled during a period of nutrient pollution declined (to 6-7 mcg/l) following abatement. As expected, water transparency indicated by summer Secchi depths showed an opposite response increasing from ~3.5<c2><a0>m in the 1970s to >10<c2><a0>m by 2003 but declined to 6-7<c2><a0>m in more recent years. Zooplankton communities have experienced declines in overall densities, and the community has changed but its primary components, Bosmina and Diacyclops remain. Ceriodaphnia lacustris abundance declined substantially from the 1970s to the recent time period while Chydorus sphaericus increased and Eurytemora affinis and Cercopagis pengoi had first appearances. In contrast, benthic invertebrate biomass increased substantially between time periods. Increases in families and occurrence of gastropods were observed, but the primary components--chironomids, amphipods, and oligochaetes--were consistent between the periods with the exception of dreissenid mussels. Dreissena was dominated by D. bugensis, and both D. bugensis and D. polymorpha show evidence of recent declines. Conversely, high abundance of round goby (Apollonia melanostomus) has promoted new trophic pathways. Downstream attenuation in nutrients and chlorophyll, and increased transparency suggest continued strong effects of Lake Ontario on the downstream river environment, but increased energy in the benthos has likely promoted greater in situ production.

title={Changes in attachment strength and aggregation of zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha in the presence of potential fish predators of various species and size},
abstract={We studied the attachment strength and aggregation behaviour of Dreissena polymorpha in the presence of large roach Rutilus rutilus (>180 mm total length) (efficient molluscivore), small roach (<110 mm) (unable to feed on zebra mussels) and perch Perca fluviatilis (not feeding on mussels). The intention was to check whether small (<10 mm) and large (>10 mm) mussels would respond specifically to fish capable of consuming them (i.e. large roach). After 1 day of exposure, we found no significant differences in mussel attachment strength. After 6 days in the presence of large roach, mussels were attached more strongly than in the other treatments. After a 1-day exposure to all kinds of fish, mussels were more aggregated than in the control treatment. After 6 days, the largest percentage of aggregated mussels was found in the presence of large roach, while the aggregation levels in the other treatments were lower and did not differ from one another. Perhaps, an initial response was a non-specific reaction to the presence of any fish, while a specific response to large roach appeared later. Thus, zebra mussels were able to recognize their potential predators. The observed behaviour of mussels may enhance their resistance to molluscivores in the field by limiting the access of predators to their potential prey (due to the increased aggregation of prey) and by increasing predator handling costs (due to the stronger attachment of prey).

title={Heavy metal concentrations in the soft tissues of swan mussel (Anodonta cygnea) and surficial sediments from Anzali wetland, Iran},
abstract={Concentrations of cadmium, copper, and lead were determined in surficial sediments and the soft tissues (foot and gills) of swan mussel Anodonta cygnea from two sampling sites in Anzali wetland, which is an internationally important wetland registered in the Ramsar Convention. The metal contents in the mussel species from the studied region were comparable to other world areas. In most cases, the levels of the metals either fell within the range for other areas or were lower. There were significant differences between the tissues for the accumulation of Cd and Pb. Only in the case of Pb accumulation in gills significant differences between the specimens from the selected sampling sites could be observed. Age-related correlations were found in the case of Cu accumulation in foot and Cd levels in gills. No weight-dependent trend could be observed for the accumulation of the three elements. There was significant negative width-dependent relationship in the case of Cu. A significant negative correlation was also found between the maximum shell height and Cu accumulation in the gills. The only association among the elements in the selected soft tissues was found between Cd and Pb. Highly significant differences could be found between the sampling sites from the concentration of the elements in sediments point of view. The pattern of metal occurrence in the selected tissues and sediments exhibited the following descending order: Pb, Cu>Cd for gills, Cu>Pb, Cd for foot, and Cu>Pb>Cd for sediments. The mean concentrations of Cd and Pb in the sediments from the study area were higher than the global baseline values and world average shale. In the case of Cu, our results were somewhat higher than the baseline values but well below the world average shale.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Ecology of freshwater shore zones},
abstract={Freshwater shore zones are among the most ecologically valuable parts of the planet, but have been heavily damaged by human activities. Because the management and rehabilitation of freshwater shore zones could be improved by better use of ecological knowledge, we summarize here what is known about their ecological functioning. Shore zones are complexes of habitats that support high biodiversity, which is enhanced by high physical complexity and connectivity. Shore zones dissipate large amounts of physical energy, can receive and process extraordinarily high inputs of autochthonous and allochthonous organic matter, and are sites of intensive nutrient cycling. Interactions between organic matter inputs (including wood), physical energy, and the biota are especially important. In general, the ecological character of shore zone ecosystems is set by inputs of physical energy, geologic (or anthropogenic) structure, the hydrologic regime, nutrient inputs, the biota, and climate. Humans have affected freshwater shore zones by laterally compressing and stabilizing the shore zone, changing hydrologic regimes, shortening and simplifying shorelines, hardening shorelines, tidying shore zones, increasing inputs of physical energy that impinge on shore zones, pollution, recreational activities, resource extraction, introducing alien species, changing climate, and intensive development in the shore zone. Systems to guide management and restoration by quantifying ecological services provided by shore zones and balancing multiple (and sometimes conflicting) values are relatively recent and imperfect. We close by identifying leading challenges for shore zone ecology and management.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Issue Title: Upper Mississippi River Research Synthesis: Forty Years of Ecological Research / Guest Editors: S.P. Romano & B. Ickes Studies on the Upper Mississippi River, particularly over the last 15<c2><a0>years, have contributed to our understanding of trophic processes in large rivers. The framework established by earlier population-specific studies, however, cannot be overlooked. Examination of the feeding habits of fish ranging from planktivores to piscivores gave the first indication that trophic processes were influenced by the spatial complexity and annual hydrological patterns of river-floodplain ecosystems. Experimental studies, which have often been considered impossible or impractical in large rivers, demonstrated the potential for biotic controls of system dynamics through predator-prey and competitive interactions. Such studies have been particularly helpful in understanding the potential impact of non-native species, including zebra mussels and Asian carp, to biodiversity and secondary production. Our understanding of riverine ecosystem function expanded greatly as food web studies began the application of a new tool--natural stable isotopes. Studies employing stable isotopes illustrated how food webs in a number of large rivers throughout the world are supported by the autochthonous production of microalgae. This study, coupled with other studies testing the prevailing models of riverine ecosystem function, has brought us to a point of better understanding the nature of river ecosystem functions. It is through looking back at the earlier studies of fish diet that we should realize that the temporal and spatial complexities of river ecosystem function must still be addressed more fully. This and a better grasp of the significance of the arrangement of patches within the riverine landscape will prove beneficial, as we assess the appropriate scale of river rehabilitation with an eye on how rehabilitation promotes productivity within complex ecosystems, including the Upper Mississippi River.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Issue Title: Upper Mississippi River Research Synthesis: Forty Years of Ecological Research / Guest Editors: S.P. Romano & B. Ickes The articles in this volume of Hydrobiologia commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Mississippi River Research Consortium by synthesizing research and monitoring conducted on the river over the past 40<c2><a0>years. This article briefly describes the recent history of development (since 1866) of the river and the programs that currently support monitoring, research, and rehabilitation of the river. These programs have generated much of the information reported in the articles, which cover hydrology and geomorphology, contaminants, nutrients, plants, reptiles and amphibians, food webs, and concepts of river ecology. The Upper Mississippi River is still responding to changes that occurred 70 or more years ago (construction of navigation dams, leveeing of the floodplains, and intensification of agriculture in the catchment) and to new stressors (climate change, invasive species, hormone-disrupting chemicals). Nevertheless, the river continues to attract 12 million visitors per year along the scenic Great River Road, hosts 36% of all the migrating ducks in the contiguous United States, and is home to 129 native species of freshwater fishes. The biological productivity and diversity of the river are likely to be maintained and even enhanced if the following occur: (1) planned rehabilitation efforts are coupled with hypothesis testing (adaptive environmental assessment and management); (2) sampling is extended beyond the six river reaches that are currently monitored intensively; (3) new sensor networks are developed and deployed; (4) water quality is protected by better controls on nonpoint sources and better testing of new chemicals before they are widely introduced; and (5) ways are found to engage multidisciplinary teams of academic scientists around the world, as well as agency scientists and managers, in cooperative efforts to better understand and manage large, complex, dynamic floodplain-river ecosystems.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Significant ecosystem-wide effects of the swiftly spreading invasive freshwater bivalve Limnoperna fortunei},
abstract={Since its introduction in South America around 1990, the freshwater Asian mussel Limnoperna<c2><a0>fortunei has been shown to strongly interact with several components of the local biota. However, investigation of its ecosystem-wide effects was hindered by (1) difficulties associated with evaluation of its densities over large spatial scales and (2) scarcity of pre-invasion environmental data. The present survey overcomes these shortcomings and addresses the question whether Limnoperna's impact on the ecosystem-wide scale is measurable and significant. On the basis of diver-collected bottom samples, we estimated the overall density of this mussel in a reservoir (Embalse de R<c3><ad>o Tercero, Argentina), where Limnoperna is present since 1998 and analyzed changes in several water-column properties before and after the invasion. The 47<c2><a0>km2 reservoir hosts around 45<c2><a0>billion mussels; at these densities, a volume equivalent to that of this water body can potentially be filtered by the bivalves every 2-3<c2><a0>days. Data collected regularly since 1996 indicate that after the invasion water transparency increased, and suspended matter, chlorophyll a, and primary production decreased significantly, with strong changes occurring in the area with highest mussel densities. Our results indicate that the ecosystem-wide impacts of Limnoperna are generally comparable to those described in Europe and North America for another invasive mussel--Dreissena<c2><a0>polymorpha. However, given Limnoperna's wider tolerance limits, its influence on newly invaded water bodies, potentially including Europe and North America, will probably be stronger. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Home-field advantage: native signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) out consume newly introduced crayfishes for invasive Chinese mystery snail (Bellamya chinensis)},
abstract={The introduction of non-indigenous plants, animals and pathogens is one of today's most pressing environmental challenges. Freshwater ecologists are challenged to predict the potential consequences of species invasions because many ecosystems increasingly support novel assemblages of native and non-native species that are likely to interact in complex ways. In this study we evaluated how native signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) and non-native red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) and northern crayfish (Orconectes virilis) utilize a novel prey resource: the non-native Chinese mystery snail (Bellamya chinensis). All species are widespread in the United States, as well as globally, and recent surveys have discovered them co-occurring in lakes of Washington State. A series of mesocosm experiments revealed that crayfish are able to consume B. chinensis, despite the snail's large size, thick outer shell and trapdoor defense behaviour. Crayfish exhibited size-selective predation whereby consumption levels decreased with increasing snail size; a common pattern among decapod predators. Comparison of prey profitability curves--defined as the yield of food (weight of snail tissue) per second of feeding time (the time taken to crack the shell and consume the contents)--suggests that small and very large snails may represent the most profitable prey choice. By contrast, previous studies have reported the opposite pattern for crayfish consumption on thin-shelled snails. For all snail size classes, we found that native P. leniusculus and invasive O. virilis consumed greater numbers of snails than invasive P. clarkii. Moreover, P. leniusculus consistently handled and consumed snails at a faster pace compared to both invasive crayfishes across the range of snail sizes examined in our study. These results suggest not only that B. chinensis is a suitable food source for crayfish, but also that native P. leniusculus may ultimately out-consume invasive crayfishes for this new prey resource.

title={Influence of substrate preference and complexity on co-existence of two non-native gammarideans (Crustacea: Amphipoda)},
abstract={Substrate choice, swimming activity and risk to predation by burbot (Lota lota) of the well established Gammarus roeselii and the invader Dikerogammarus villosus were studied in mixed and single-species aquarium experiments. We used stones, gravel and aquatic weeds (Elodea, Chara) as substrates. We hypothesized that both species have different substrate preferences and that substrate affects the predation risk. We also assumed that presence of D. villosus influences substrate preference and predation risk of G. roeselii since the invader is known to affect the behavior of other gammarids. Adults of D. villosus in single species experiments and juveniles in mixed and single species experiments were evenly distributed over the different substrates but adults in mixed species experiments were more likely to prefer stone substrate. In contrast, adults and juveniles of G. roeselii clearly preferred aquatic weeds independent of the presence/absence of the invader. Both species preferred substrates with fissured surface over substrates with smooth surface. Gammarus roeselii was observed swimming more often than D. villosus in the open water but its swimming activity was lower when its preferred substrate was present compared with its swimming activity if non-preferred substrates were present. Predation rate of burbot on D. villosus was comparatively low and independent of the substrate. Burbot consumed many more G. roeselii than D. villosus, both in mixed and single species experiments. But when the preferred substrate of G. roeselii (weeds) was used in the experiments, predation rate of burbot on G. roeselii was somewhat lower than that when non-preferred substrates were present. The results of the experiments support our hypothesis that the gammarids studied here have different substrate preferences and that presence of the preferred substrate can affect predation risk. However, there is no evidence that presence of D. villosus affected substrate choice or predation risk in G. roeselii. We consider that differences in use of spatial niches permit co-existence of G. roeselii and D. villosus in the wild when substrates are diverse. The fact that G. roeselii than D. villosus is more often observed swimming in the open water may explain its higher risk of being captured by fish. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Results indicated that recruitment was strongly affected by the presence and density of conspecifics.

Also, after 3<c2><a0>months of exposure, recruits in all treatments with adults present were larger than recruits in the control treatment. Our results suggest that conspecific adults have a positive effect on recruitment success and growth of newly settled juveniles through factors that enhance larval settling or that contribute to the survival of settlers in areas colonized by adult conspecifics.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Freshwater mussels are one of the most threatened faunas in North America and worldwide, but little research has examined factors leading to successful reproduction (gamete development and fertilization success) in these species. We combined field and laboratory studies to determine the environmental factors influencing successful reproduction in three closely related species of freshwater mussels in a south central U.S. river. Successful gamete development in the field was linked to temperature, specifically the number of accumulated degree days. Laboratory studies confirmed this finding, but also suggested that temperature and food availability interact to regulate gamete development. Our data indicate that successful reproduction may be inhibited by altered temperature regimes found below impoundments. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={We investigated the occurrence pattern of the pond-living endangered cyprinid, Pseudorasbora pumila, and also compared its habitat characteristics with those of the congeneric invasive species, Pseudorasbora parva, in the contact zone. Comparison of 16 environmental variables among the P. pumila habitats, P. parva habitats, and unoccupied ponds revealed that conductivity was a common limitation factor of distribution of both species. We found that emergent vegetation occupancy along the pond bank was the most important factor determining P. pumila occurrence and that ponds with steep banks may have a low probability of containing P. parva. We constructed a logistic regression model to predict the establishment risk of P. parva in ponds occupied by P. pumila. The model demonstrated that more than half of the ponds exhibited a high establishment risk of P. parva. Principal component analysis using six parameters selected from stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that seven unoccupied ponds had the potential to sustain P. pumila, suggesting that our study site is capable of supporting more P. pumila populations and expanding the current range.

abstract={Over 35<c2><a0>years of US and Canadian pollution prevention and control efforts have led to substantial improvements in environmental quality of the Detroit River and western Lake Erie. However, the available information also shows that much remains to be done. Improvements in environmental quality have resulted in significant ecological recovery, including increasing populations of bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), peregrine falcons (Falco columbarius), lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens), lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis), walleye (Sander vitreus), and burrowing mayflies (Hexagenia spp.). Although this recovery is remarkable, many challenges remain, including population growth, transportation expansion, and land use changes; nonpoint source pollution; toxic substances contamination; habitat loss and degradation; introduction of exotic species; and greenhouse gases and global warming. Research/monitoring must be sustained for effective management. Priority research and monitoring needs include: demonstrating and quantifying cause-effect relationships; establishing quantitative endpoints and desired future states; determining cumulative impacts and how indicators relate; improving modeling and prediction; prioritizing geographic areas for protection and restoration; and fostering long-term monitoring for adaptive management.

title={The role of solid waste materials as habitats for macroinvertebrates in a lowland dam reservoir},
abstract={Because of the increasing anthropogenic pressure, the amount of solid waste discarded in water is growing considerably. It can affect aquatic organisms, modifying their distribution and abundance. This study was designed to investigate the effect of several types of solid waste (bottles, textiles, bundles of string, pieces of polythene and rubber) upon the taxonomic composition and biodiversity of macroinvertebrates inhabiting the near-shore zone (up to 1-m depth) of the Wocawek Reservoir (the River Vistula, central Poland). The epifauna developing on these materials was compared with organisms living on natural substrata: bare sandy bottom (from which the waste was collected), macrophytes and sandy bottom overgrown by plants. The communities inhabiting the artificial substrata (except strings) were much more diverse (in terms of taxon richness, Shannon-Wiener index and evenness) than the surrounding bare sandy bottom. The biodiversity on the waste was similar to that found on the macrophytes and bottom among them, located nearby. The most suitable materials appeared to be bottles, providing shelters in their interiors. The artificial substrata differed considerably from all natural habitats with respect to taxonomic composition, though they were more similar to the macrophytes than to the bottom sediments. Furthermore, the variability among the assemblages developing on the particular waste objects, even of the same type, was much larger than that observed on the macrophytes, indicating the patchy nature of the former habitat. Thus, discarded waste can constitute alternative habitats for invertebrates, especially when natural substrata are unsuitable (e.g. sandy bottom), but they cannot fully replace natural substrata, such as plants, in their habitat-forming role in ecosystems.

title={Contaminant concentrations in Asian carps, invasive species in the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers},
abstract={Populations of invasive fishes quickly reach extremely high biomass. Before control methods can be applied, however, an understanding of the contaminant loads of these invaders carry is needed. We investigated differences in concentrations of selected elements in two invasive carp species as a function of sampling site, fish species, length and trophic differences using stable isotopes (<ce><b4> 15N, <ce><b4> 13C). Fish were collected from three different sites, the Illinois River near Havana, Illinois, and two sites in the Mississippi River, upstream and downstream of the Illinois River confluence. Five bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) and five silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) from each site were collected for muscle tissue analyses. Freshwater mussels (Amblema plicata) previously collected in the same areas were used as an isotopic baseline to standardize fish results among sites. Total fish length, trophic position, and corrected 13C, were significantly related to concentrations of metals in muscle. Fish length explained the most variation in metal concentrations, with most of that variation related to mercury levels. This result was not unexpected because larger fish are older, giving them a higher probability of exposure and accumulation of contaminants. There was a significant difference in stable isotope profiles between the two species. Bighead carp occupied a higher trophic position and had higher levels of corrected 13C than silver carp. Additionally bighead carp had significantly lower concentrations of arsenic and selenium than silver carp. Stable isotope ratios of nitrogen in Asian carp were at levels that are more commonly associated with higher-level predators, or from organisms in areas containing high loads of wastewater effluent.

Multivariate techniques have long been used to analyse complex data sets. This paper discusses the methods currently in use and introduces the principal response curves method, which overcomes the problem of cluttered graphical results representation that is a great drawback of most conventional methods. To illustrate this, two example data sets are analysed using two ordination techniques, principal component analysis and principal response curves. Whereas PCA results in a difficult-to-interpret diagram, principal response curves related methods are able to show changes in community composition in a diagram that is easy to read. The principal response curves method is used to show trends over time with an internal reference (overall mean or reference year) or external reference (e.g. preferred water quality or reference site). Advantages and disadvantages of both methods are discussed and illustrated. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Background levels of the DNA damage in haemocytes of painter's mussels are defined for both assays for easier detection of contamination-related genotoxicity. U. pictorum is found to be a very suitable sentinel species, sufficiently sensitive to the impact of pollution but at the same time unsusceptible to stress caused by translocation or cage exposure.},

title={Effect of attachment status and aggregation on the behaviour of the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha},
abstract={The zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha lives attached to a hard substratum, often in dense aggregations. It can thus be expected that both its attachment status and conspecifics may greatly affect its responses to various environmental stimuli. We studied whether the attachment status influenced mussel relocation frequency and responses to light and gravity in laboratory conditions. We also tested the impact of conspecifics upon mussel attachment strength and relocation frequency. Small (<10 mm) and large (>10 mm) mussels attached for 1 or 6 days relocated from their initial positions less frequently than unattached individuals. Large mussels crawled less often than small individuals, but neither attachment status nor size modified their responses to light: illuminated (100 lx) mussels always moved towards dark areas and changed their initial sites less often than those kept in darkness. On a slope inclined at 8<c2><b0>, unattached small mussels preferred upward movement in darkness whereas large mussels moved similarly in both directions and were less mobile than small individuals. The behaviour of mussels attached for 6 days was reversed: negative geotaxis disappeared in small mussels, while large mussels preferred to crawl upwards and moved more often than small individuals. Aggregated mussels of both size groups were more strongly attached to the substratum and stayed at their initial sites more often than singletons. Our study shows that attachment status and conspecifics can modify responses of zebra mussels to environmental stimuli and should be taken into account in behavioural studies on this species.},

title={Mechanisms of habitat segregation between an invasive and an indigenous mussel: settlement, post-settlement mortality and recruitment},
abstract={The mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis is highly invasive worldwide, but displays varying degrees of local and regional coexistence with indigenous mussels through spatial habitat segregation. We investigated the roles of settlement, post-settlement mortality, juvenile growth and recruitment in partial habitat segregation between the invasive M. galloprovincialis and the indigenous mussel Perna perna on the south coast of South Africa. We used two study locations, Plettenberg Bay and Tsitsikamma, 70 km apart, with two sites (separated by 300-400 m) per location, each divided into three vertical zones. There were no significant effects in Tsitsikamma, where daily settlement and monthly recruitment were significantly lower than in Plettenberg Bay. In Plettenberg Bay, settlement (primary and secondary) and recruitment of both species decreased upshore. Post-settlement mortality was measured over two consecutive 6-day periods during a spring tide and a neap tide. For both species mortality was low on the low-shore. High-shore mortality was consistently low for M. galloprovincialis, but increased dramatically for P. perna during spring tide. No data were obtained for growth of P. perna, but juvenile M. galloprovincialis grew more slowly farther upshore. P. perna recruited mainly in spring and summer, with a peak in summer far greater than for M. galloprovincialis. Recruitment of M. galloprovincialis was more protracted, continuing through autumn and winter. Thus local coexistence is due to a combination of pre- and post-recruitment factors differing in importance for each species. P. perna is excluded from the high-shore by recruitment failure (low settlement, high mortality). High survival and slow growth in juveniles may allow large densities of M. galloprovincialis to accumulate there, despite low settlement rates. With no differences between species in settlement or mortality on the low-shore, exclusion of M. galloprovincialis from that zone is likely to be by post-recruitment processes, possibly strengthened by periodic heavy recruitments of P. perna. At larger scales, larval retention and protracted recruitment contribute to the success of M. galloprovincialis at Plettenberg Bay, while recruitment limitation may explain why M. galloprovincialis is less successful at other sites.

title={Resource switching in fish following a major food web disruption},
abstract={Dreissenid mussels (Dreissena polymorpha and D. bugensis) have re-engineered Great Lakes ecosystems since their introduction in the late 1980s. Dreissenids can have major indirect impacts on profundal habitats by redirecting nutrients and energy away from pelagic production (which supplies profundal production) and depositing nutrients and energy in the nearshore zones that they occupy. However, strong empirical evidence for the effects of this redirection of resources on fish populations is currently lacking. Here, we report significant shifts in isotopic signatures, depth distribution and diets of a coldwater profundal fish population that are all consistent with a greater reliance on nearshore resources after the establishment of dreissenid mussels in South Bay, Lake Huron. Isotopic signatures of scales collected from 5-year-old lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) demonstrated remarkable stability over the 50-year period prior to the establishment of dreissenids (1947-1997) and a sudden and significant change in isotopic signatures (3[per thousand] enrichment in <ce><b4>13C and 1[per thousand] depletion in <ce><b4>15N) after their establishment (2001-2005). These dramatic shifts in isotopic signatures were accompanied by a coincident shift in the mean depth of capture of lake whitefish towards the nearshore. A comparison of previously unpublished pre-invasion diets of lake whitefish from South Bay with contemporary diets collected between 2002 and 2005 also indicate a greater reliance on nearshore prey after the invasion of dreissenid mussels. This study is the first to report changes in the carbon source available to lake whitefish associated with restructured benthic communities after the appearance of dreissenid mussels. Further, this study contributes to a growing body of work that demonstrates the ecological insights that can be gained through isotopic analysis of archived fish bony tissues in ecosystems that have experienced significant levels of disturbance.},

title={Ecosystem engineering and biodiversity in coastal sediments: posing hypotheses},
abstract={Coastal sediments in sheltered temperate locations are strongly modified by ecosystem engineering species such as marsh plants, seagrass, and algae as well as by epibenthic and endobenthic invertebrates. These ecosystem engineers are shaping the coastal sea and landscape, control particulate and dissolved material fluxes between the land and sea, and between the benthos and the passing water or air. Above all, habitat engineering exerts facilitating and inhibiting effects on biodiversity. Despite a strongly growing interest in the functional role of ecosystem engineering over the recent years, compared to food web analyses, the conceptual understanding of engineering-mediated species interactions is still in its infancy. In the present paper, we provide a concise overview on current insights and propose two hypotheses on the general mechanisms by which ecosystem engineering may affect biodiversity in coastal sediments. We hypothesise that autogenic and allogenic ecosystem engineers have inverse effects on epibenthic and endobenthic biodiversity in coastal sediments. The primarily autogenic structures of the epibenthos achieve high diversity at the expense of endobenthos, whilst allogenic sediment reworking by infauna may facilitate other infauna and inhibits epibenthos. On a larger scale, these antagonistic processes generate patchiness and habitat diversity. Due to such interaction, anthropogenic influences can strongly modify the engineering community by removing autogenic ecosystem engineers through coastal engineering or bottom trawling. Another source of anthropogenic influences comes from introducing invasive engineers, from which the impact is often hard to predict. We hypothesise that the local biodiversity effects of invasive ecosystem engineers will depend on the engineering strength of the invasive species, with engineering strength defined as the number of habitats it can invade and the extent of modification. At a larger scale of an entire shore, biodiversity need not be decreased by invasive engineers and may even increase. On a global scale, invasive engineers may cause shore biota to converge, especially visually due to the presence of epibenthic structures.},

title={Overcrowding, food and phosphorus limitation effects on ephipphia production and population dynamics in the invasive species Daphnia lumholtzi},
abstract={Daphnia lumholtzi has been very successful in colonizing North America since its appearance in Texas in 1990. Although previous studies have sought to link its success as an invasive species with various aspects of its population biology, there is little experimental data linking the invasion success of D. lumholtzi with its autecology, specifically its reproduction strategy. In this study we sought to link food quality and quantity to diapause in D. lumholtzi through a variation in phosphorus (P) content of algae, food quantity, and light level. We also assessed the effect of Daphnia peak population densities on reproductive rates and production of resting eggs. We found that when food is abundant, per capita ephippia production may be limited by P, but under food limitation conditions, there is no significant effect of food quality on ephippia production. Our results suggest that a combination of food quality/quantity and population density may work together to induce the production of resting eggs in this invasive species. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Reforming Watershed Restoration: Science in Need of Application and Applications in Need of Science},
abstract={Coastal and inland waters are continuing to decline in many parts of the world despite major efforts made to restore them. This is due in part to the inadequate role that ecological science has played in shaping restoration efforts. A significant amount of fundamental ecological knowledge dealing with issues such as system dynamics, state changes, context-dependency of ecological response, and diversity is both under-used by managers and practitioners and under-developed by ecologists for use in real-world applications. Some of the science that is being 'used' has not been adequately tested. Thus, restoration ecology as a science and ecological restoration as a practice are in need of reform. I identify five ways in which our ecological knowledge should be influencing restoration to a far greater extent than at present including a need to: shift the focus to restoration of process and identification of the limiting factors instead of structures and single species, add ecological insurance to all projects, identify a probabilistic range of possible outcomes instead of a reference condition, expand the spatial scale of efforts, and apply hierarchical approaches to prioritization. Prominent examples of restoration methods or approaches that are commonly used despite little evidence to support their efficacy are highlighted such as the use of only structural enhancements to restore biodiversity. There are also major gaps in scientific knowledge that are of immediate need to policy makers, managers, and restoration practitioners including: predictive frameworks to guide the restoration of ecological processes, identification of social-ecological feedbacks that constrain ecosystem recovery and data to support decisions of where and how to implement restoration projects to achieve the largest gains. I encourage ecologists to respond to the demand for their scientific input so that restoration can shift from an engineering-driven process to a more sustainable enterprise that fully integrates ecological processes and social science methods.

title={Contrasting impacts of invasive engineers on freshwater ecosystems: an experiment and meta-analysis},
abstract={Invasion by common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) in shallow lakes have been followed by stable-state changes from a macrophyte-dominated clear water state to a phytoplankton-dominated turbid water state. Both invasive carp and crayfish are, therefore, possible drivers for catastrophic regime shifts. Despite these two species having been introduced into ecosystems world-wide, their relative significance on regime shifts remains largely unexplored. We compared the ecological impacts of carp and crayfish on submerged macrophytes, water quality, phytoplankton, nutrient dynamics, zooplankton and benthic macroinvertebrates by combining an enclosure experiment and a meta-analysis. The experiment was designed to examine how water quality and biological variables responded to increasing carp or crayfish biomass. We found that even at a low biomass, carp had large and positive impacts on suspended solids, phytoplankton and nutrients and negative impacts on benthic macroinvertebrates. In contrast, crayfish had a strong negative impact on submerged macrophytes. The impacts of crayfish on macrophytes were significantly greater than those of carp. The meta-analysis showed that both carp and crayfish have significant effects on submerged macrophytes, phytoplankton, nutrient dynamics and benthic macroinvertebrates, while zooplankton are affected by carp but not crayfish. It also indicated that crayfish have significantly greater impacts on macrophytes relative to carp. Overall, the meta-analysis largely supported the results of the experiment. Taken as a whole, our results show that both carp and crayfish have profound effects on community composition and ecosystem processes through combined consequences of bioturbation, excretion, consumption and non-consumptive destruction. However, key variables (e.g. macrophytes) relating to stable-state changes responded differently to increasing carp or crayfish biomass, indicating that they have differential ecosystem impacts.},

title={Mussel Cultivation to Improve Water Quality in the Szczecin Lagoon},
abstract={According to the EU Water Framework Directive, all surface waters should reach a good ecological status by 2015. While it seems realistic to achieve this objective for the river Oder/Odra itself, the water quality of the Szczecin (Oder-) Lagoon cannot be sufficiently improved through river basin management alone. Therefore, supporting internal measures must be considered. The zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, a species currently inhabiting the whole lagoon, has a high filtration potential. With filtration rates of 3000-4000 l m^sup -2^ d^sup -1^ Dreissena could potentially improve water quality, especially water transparency, which is a key factor for beneficial regional tourism development. Cultivation of mussels, combined with systematic harvest could help to reduce the nutrient content in the Szczecin Lagoon. This article presents the results of a literature-based suitability analysis for cultivating Dreissena polymorpha in the lagoon. Besides ecological and filtration effects, economic utilization of Dreissena is discussed to assess costs and benefits of mussel aquaculture. The results show that selling Dreissena is difficult. Therefore, economic benefits of cultivation are limited. Further financing strategies could be a tourism fee for water quality improvement or nutrient emission certificates.},

title={Effects of water-depth and water-level fluctuations on the macroinvertebrate community structure in the littoral zone of Lake Constance},
abstract={In a 2-year field study, abundance, biomass and community structure of benthic macroinvertebrates and their seasonal dynamics were assessed along the depth gradient in the stony littoral zone of Lake Constance, Central Europe. The macroinvertebrate community patterns differed significantly between the depth zones, partly because of species turnover, but mostly as a result of different dominance structures. These distinct differences should be considered when designing surveys of benthic invertebrates also for applied purposes, since sources of variation should be kept small and particularly on hard substrates, extensive efforts are required to obtain sufficient data for a powerful statistical analysis. A large seasonal variability in the macroinvertebrate communities of the eulittoral zone indicates a strong influence of physical disturbances, particularly of water-level fluctuations. The community pattern of the drift line samples was influenced by the previous development of the water level. The cumulated water-level fluctuations and their net tendency accounted for three quarters of the variation in a PCA. Since Lake Constance is the only large pre-alpine lake whose water level is not extensively regulated, the uniqueness of the littoral community should have implications for nature conservation measures.},

title={Effects of water-level fluctuations on lakes: an annotated bibliography},
abstract={Water-level fluctuations (WLF) in lakes and rivers, especially their extent, frequency and duration, are dominant forces controlling the functioning of these ecosystems. In particular, WLF play an important role in the lake<e2><80><99>s littoral and aquatic<e2><80><93>terrestrial interface processes. WLF may take place on different spatial and temporal scales under natural conditions but water levels have been artificially modified in regulated lakes, and their impacts are expected to be enhanced within the actual global change scenarios with forthcoming management problems. This article presents an overview on the literature published on this important topic since 1991 by using journals indexed in the ISI Web of Knowledge. The overall objective was to examine temporal and spatial trends in publications on WLF, the specific aspect of WLF concerned and their main effects. Throughout the article we have used case studies to illustrate different effects of WLF on the variety of lake habitats and indicators that have been studied. Overall, the number of papers published on the subject since the 1990s has risen steadily, when less than ten papers were published each year; until 2006 and peaking in 2005. The greatest number of papers on WLF has been carried out in Europe and North America (c. 73%). These data also showed that the effects of WLF have not been studied equally for different groups of organisms. There is a greater interest on macrophytes, which are the most studied group of organisms (18.4% of the papers). Nearly 7% of the papers deal with algae, and zooplankton and invertebrates account for a 7% followed by fish. WLF effects on ecosystems are very complex, and the biological effects in lakes are greatest in shallow water and littoral areas, where even small changes in water levels can result in the conversion of large areas of a standing-water environment in air exposed habitats. Finally, these data might serve to highlight knowledge gaps still existing on this topic and, in particular, some of the approaches that can potentially contribute to solve several of these lacunae are explored.},

title={A trait-based approach to species' roles in stream ecosystems: climate change, community structure, and material cycling},
abstract={The sustained decline in habitat quality and community integrity highlights the importance of understanding how communities and environmental variation interactively contribute to ecosystem services. We performed a laboratory experiment manipulating effects of acclimation temperature (5, 15, 25, and 35<c2><b0>C) on resource acquisition, assimilation and subsequent ecosystem services provided by eight freshwater mussel species. Our results suggest that although freshwater mussels are broadly categorized as filter feeders, there are distinct nested functional guilds (thermally tolerant and sensitive) associated with their thermal performance. At 35<c2><b0>C, thermally tolerant species have increased resource assimilation and higher rates of contributed ecosystem services (nutrient excretion, benthic-pelagic coupling). Conversely, thermally sensitive species have decreased assimilation rates and display an array of functional responses including increased/decreased benthic-pelagic coupling and nutrient excretion. Although thermally sensitive species may be in poorer physiological condition at warmer temperatures, their physiological responses can have positive effects on ecosystem services. We extrapolated these results to real mussel beds varying in species composition to address how shifts in community composition coupled with climate change may shift their contributed ecological services. Comparative field data indicate that two co-existing, abundant species with opposing thermal performance (Actinonaias ligamentina, Amblema plicata) differentially dominate community biomass. Additionally, communities varying in the relative proportion of these species differentially influence the magnitude (benthic-pelagic coupling) and quality (N:P excretion) of ecosystem services. As species are increasingly threatened by climate change, greater emphasis should be placed on understanding the contribution of physiological stress to the integrity and functioning of ecosystems.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={In the previous decade, four species of non-native gobies have invaded the middle section of the river Danube and its tributaries. An effective tool for understanding biological invasions is the evaluation of various biological traits (morphological, life history, ontogenetic) within an epigenetic context. The present study examines the external morphology of monkey goby Neogobius fluviatilis (Pallas, 1814) from the mouth of the River Hron, the morphological differences among three goby species (monkey, bighead and round) and the relevance of these differences for invasive potential. Monkey goby reach their definite phenotype very early in their ontogeny and thus represent a strongly precocial (specialized) species with direct development. The morphological differences between monkey and two other goby species also reflect its strong specialization for sandy substrata and smaller prey types. Thus, monkey goby are not expected to spread to new areas as fast as the round and bighead gobies, and their distribution is likely to be limited to sandy and/or sandy-gravel substrata. If this assumption is correct, then the potential adverse impact of monkey goby on native fauna or even ecosystem is likely to be less than that of the bighead and round gobies.

title={A shift in the habitat use pattern of a lentic galaxiid fish: an acute behavioural response to an introduced predator},
abstract={Despite potentially reducing predation mortality, behavioural responses of native species to introduced predators may still have sub-lethal impacts. In video-recorded laboratory trials, we examined the effects of introduced brown trout, Salmo trutta, on the short-term behaviour of a threatened, lake-dwelling galaxiid fish and confirmed a suspected diel pattern in habitat use by this species. We found that Galaxias auratus followed a distinct diel pattern in the use of complex habitats and open water, which was significantly altered by the presence of brown trout. In trials without the introduced predator, G. auratus used complex habitats (rocks or macrophytes) during the day, and open water during the night. In trials with brown trout present, G.<c2><a0>auratus spent significantly less time in open water and rarely ventured out of the macrophytes. However, when given the option of using only rocky substrate or open water, which is the more common situation in the lakes to which this galaxiid is endemic, the fish reduced the amount of time they spent in the open water during the night, but still spent more time in open water than when macrophytes were available. Spending the daylight hours amongst the cover of rocks or macrophytes is most likely an adaptation to reduce the risk of predation by visual predators, and the pattern of reduced use of open water habitats in the presence of brown trout is an acute response to the close proximity of the introduced predator. The difference in the nocturnal use of macrophytes and rocks when trout are present may be related to differences in feeding opportunities or success within these habitats. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Growth chronologies were compared for white suckers, Catostomus commersoni, from Little Moose (oligotrophic), Oneida (eutrophic), and Cayuga (mesotrophic) lakes (New York) from opercular bone growth increments, and for lake trout, Salvelinus namaycush, from Little Moose Lake using otolith growth. The longevity of these species allowed the development of chronologies from 17 to 33<c2><a0>years in length using only contemporary collections. We used these chronologies to examine whether fish growth histories could be used as an index for ecosystem-scale changes. Specifically, we examined whether zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, invasion in Oneida and Cayuga lakes in the early 1990s, and treatment of sewage effluent from dwellings around Little Moose Lake beginning during the late 1980s could be detected in white sucker and lake trout growth chronologies. White sucker growth in Oneida and Cayuga Lakes did not differ before and after zebra mussel invasions. Neither white sucker nor lake trout growth chronologies from Little Moose Lake reflect changes in growth expected with reduced productivity levels associated with improved sewage treatment. Growth chronologies of these two species did not detect the ecosystem-scale changes that occurred in the study lakes. (PUBLICATION ABSTRACT)},

title={Movements of wintering surf scoters: predator responses to different prey landscapes},
abstract={The distribution of predators is widely recognized to be intimately linked to the distribution of their prey. Foraging theory suggests that predators will modify their behaviors, including movements, to optimize net energy intake when faced with variation in prey attributes or abundance. While many studies have documented changes in movement patterns of animals in response to temporal changes in food, very few have contrasted movements of a single predator species naturally occurring in dramatically different prey landscapes. We documented variation in the winter movements, foraging range size, site fidelity, and distribution patterns of a molluscivorous sea duck, the surf scoter (Melanitta perspicillata), in two areas of coastal British Columbia with very different shellfish prey features. Baynes Sound has extensive tidal flats with abundant clams, which are high-quality and temporally stable prey for scoters. Malaspina Inlet is a rocky fjord-like inlet where scoters consume mussels that are superabundant and easily accessible in some patches but are heavily depleted over the course of winter. We used radio telemetry to track surf scoter movements in both areas and found that in the clam habitats of Baynes Sound, surf scoters exhibited limited movement, small winter ranges, strong foraging site fidelity, and very consistent distribution patterns. By contrast, in mussel habitats in the Malaspina Inlet, surf scoters displayed more movement, larger ranges, little fidelity to specific foraging sites, and more variable distribution patterns. We conclude that features associated with the different prey types, particularly the higher depletion rates of mussels, strongly influenced seasonal space use patterns. These findings are consistent with foraging theory and confirm that predator behavior, specifically movements, is environmentally mediated.},

title={Sand and wave induced mortality in invasive (Mytilus galloprovincialis) and indigenous (Perna perna) mussels},
abstract={The ability of an invasive species to spread in a new locality depends on its interaction with the indigenous community and on variation in time and space in the environment. The Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis invaded the South African coast 30<c2><a0>years ago and it now competes and coexists with the indigenous mussel Perna perna. The two species show different tolerances to wave and sand stress, two of the main environmental factors affecting this intertidal community. P. perna is more resistant to hydrodynamic stress than M. galloprovincialis, while the invasive species is less vulnerable to sand action. Our results show that mortality rates of the two species over a period of 6<c2><a0>months had different timing. The indigenous species had higher mortality than M. galloprovincialis during periods of high sand accumulation in mussel beds, while the pattern reversed during winter, when wave action was high. A negative correlation between sand accumulation and attachment strength of the two mussels showed that sand not only affects mussel mortality through scouring and burial, but also weakens their attachment strength, subjecting them to a higher risk of dislodgement. Here we underline the importance of variations in time and space of environmental stress in regulating the interaction between invasive and indigenous species, and how these variations can create new competitive balances.

title={Phytoplankton dynamics in nearshore and offshore regions of the Great Lakes Erie, Malawi, Tanganyika, and Victoria},
abstract={My doctoral thesis challenges the traditional paradigm of phosphorus (P) limitation of phytoplankton communities in freshwaters by suggesting colimitation of P, nitrogen (N), and iron (Fe) in Great Lakes. Oceanographers have recognized Fe, N and P colimitation, and biomass response to Fe is documented in freshwater lakes. I studied African and North American Great Lakes that are similar to large inland oceans. I discovered that Fe is a key nutrient that is often limiting in the offshore, and may explain the dominance of cyanobacteria in nutrient enriched lakes. I also discovered that the nearshore and offshore areas of these large lakes are very different, particularly when invasive dreissenid mussels are impacting the nearshore, as seen in the eastern basin of Lake Erie. As a result of the dreissenids, chlorophyll a (chla) concentrations are significantly lower in the nearshore of Lake Erie, but higher in the nearshore in the three African Great Lakes, as well as pre-dreissenid Lake Erie. The objective of my thesis was to determine the limiting nutrient(s) to the phytoplankton of the Great Lakes Erie, Malawi, Tanganyika, and Victoria in both the nearshore and offshore by measuring the physiological status of the phytoplankton. I also examined how dreissenids affect the distribution of seston and nutrient concentrations between the nearshore and offshore of the eastern basin of Lake Erie. My study design included temporal and spatial surveys in the nearshore and offshore of the four lakes, in which I used a variety of nutrient limitation indicators for P (C:P, N:P, P debt, APA, F sub(v)/F sub(m)), N (C:N, NH sub(4) debt, NO sub(3) debt, F sub(v)/F sub(m)), and Fe (F sub(v)/F sub( m)), as well as photosynthetic efficiency (F sub(v)/F sub(m)) experiments. Nutrient enrichment experiments were also conducted in the nearshore and offshore of the eastern basin of Lake Erie which involved the addition and removal of Fe alone, as well as in combination with P and/or N. Lake Erie nutrient enrichment experiments provided evidence for P, N and Fe colimitation where the addition of Fe with P relieved Fe and P limitation and allowed nitrate (NO sub(3) super(-)) assimilation, alleviating N limitation. However, the offshore experiments indicated stronger Fe limitation than the nearshore experiment. Lower chla concentrations in the post-dreissenid nearshore of the eastern basin of Lake Erie may not be due entirely to lower phytoplankton biomass, as photoacclimation of the phytoplankton may also be occurring. Dreissenid grazing effects can be seen in the distribution of dissolved nutrient concentrations between the nearshore and offshore of post-dreissenid Erie. The African Great Lakes are threatened by expanding human populations, resulting in increased nutrient runoff; the consequences of which will depend on the limiting nutrient(s). I found that the nearshore regions of Lakes Malawi and Tanganyika were colimited by N and P, while the offshore regions were colimited by N, P and Fe. The nearshore of Lake Victoria was colimited by light and N, while the offshore was colimited by N, P and Fe. Fe limitation only occurs in the offshore, and positive, significant relationships were found between total dissolved Fe concentrations and cyanobacteria. Continued P and Fe loading to the lakes will create a higher N demand that will result in a shift to N sub(2)-fixing cyanobacteria, which has serious consequences to human and ecosystem health as they are a poor nutritive food source and some are potentially toxigenic. The majority of studies conducted on Great Lakes involve offshore sampling, however, the less understood nearshore is where human impacts and activities are concentrated. I discovered there are significant differences between the nearshore and offshore, which has implications for water quality monitoring.},

title={Foraging Behavior of Surf Scoters (Melanitta Perspicillata)and White-Winged Scoters (M. Fusca) in Relation to Clam Density: Inferring Food Availability and Habitat Quality},
abstract={Birds are known to modify their foraging behavior in relation to food availability. Once understood, these relationships can be used to draw inferences about relative food availability and habitat quality. We measured foraging behavior of Surf Scoters (Melanitta perspicillata ) and White-winged Scoters (M. fusca ) feeding on clams during winter in the Strait of Georgia, British Columbia, to evaluate the relative quality of the foraging landscape for wintering scoters. Because clam biomass does not increase appreciably during winter through growth or recruitment, scoters are faced with a depleting and potentially exhaustible food supply. Along with this temporal variation, clam densities vary widely by site. We considered the influence of variation in clam density on scoter foraging behavior, along with other factors known to affect foraging in other sea duck species, such as season, sex, age, and environmental attributes. Clam-capture success (clams captured per dive) and foraging effort (minutes underwater per hour) of Surf Scoters were not related to variation in clam density. Clam-capture success of White-winged Scoters was unrelated to clam density; however, their foraging effort was negatively related to clam density, though varying by only 4 min across the range of observed clam densities. For both species, foraging behavior was generally more strongly related to other factors, especially seasonal and age effects. These results suggest that (1) observed variation in clam density was relatively minor from the perspective of foraging scoters and (2) our study site constituted high-quality winter habitat in which scoters were not constrained by food availability.

At least three distinct ecological/historical processes appear to account for the colonisation of continental waters: invasion of a clade prior to the break-up of Gondwana, as in Aphanoneura, Namanereis, Stratiodrilus, and Caobangia; relatively recent stranding of individual species (relicts); and the temporary visitation of euryhaline species.

title={Testing a molecular protocol to monitor the presence of golden mussel larvae (Limnoperna fortunei) in plankton samples},
abstract={The golden mussel (Limnoperna fortunei, Mollusca: Mytilidae) is an emerging invasive species in freshwater environments in South America, causing extensive environmental and economic impacts. A molecular method to detect larvae of the golden mussel in plankton samples has been recently developed and holds promise for becoming an important way to monitor the expansion of golden mussel populations. In the present study, we conduct, for the first time, field tests of this method by comparing its performance with alternative sampling efforts (microscopy and manual search for adults). In addition, we test different modifications of the molecular method to deal with PCR inhibition in environmental samples. The results indicate that the molecular method is very efficient, being faster and more sensitive that microscopy methods. Therefore, the molecular method tested in the present study can represent an invaluable tool in large-scale monitoring efforts of the golden mussel throughout its introduced range.},

title={Predictive Modeling of Freshwater Mussel Distributions in the Appalachians},
abstract={The eastern United States contains the greatest diversity and the most imperiled species of freshwater mussels in the world. Conservation efforts are underway, yet little information is available on current and historical distributions for most species. Current knowledge of freshwater mussel species distributions is limited to data available from museum collections, small-scale studies, and Natural Heritage surveys. The accuracy and precision of these data vary considerably. We obtained the best available information on the range of freshwater mussel species to model the distribution of selected species within the Appalachians. We included in model development anthropogenic and environmental variables, such as slope, elevation, acid deposition, soil buffering capacity, flow accumulation, density of dams, density of roads, and density of zebra mussel occurrences, believed to influence freshwater ecosystems. For each species, we applied the models derived from known species occurrences to sites within the study area where the status of the species is unknown to create maps of predicted species distributions. Our study provides another example of the application of predictive modeling at a regional scale using the best available data. However, our study differs from similar regional studies in its focus on multiple species within a taxon rather than a single species. Knowledge of the predicted distribution of these species in a large portion of their range is an important consideration in regional conservation decisions. In addition, variables that were retained in the models for each species are those that may limit the distributions of freshwater mussels in particular areas of the Appalachians; therefore, these influences can be targeted in future studies and conservation efforts.},

title={The invasive bivalve <i>Limnoperna fortunei</i> enhances benthic invertebrate densities in South American floodplain rivers},
abstract={We assessed the effects of the introduced bivalve L. fortunei on the abundance and biomass of associated benthic invertebrates in South American large floodplain rivers. The survey was based on comparisons of L. fortunei-covered and L. fortunei-barren areas in five artificial cages from where large predators were excluded, exposed to colonization by the mussel for a total of 17 months in the lower Paran<c3><a1> river delta. Accompanying invertebrates were dominated by Oligochaeta, Nematoda, Rotifera, Copepoda, Gastropoda, Hirudinea, Chironomidae and nauplii. Also present in minor numbers were Tardigrada, Turbellaria, Cladocera, Ostracoda, Insecta, Hydracarina and Decapoda. Dominant invertebrates were 27<e2><80><93>100% more numerous (and hosted 43<e2><80><93>100% more biomass) in areas with L. fortunei than in areas barren of the mussel. In areas with L. fortunei, total invertebrate biomass (excluding the bivalve) was positively correlated with mussel biomass, and increased with time of exposure under water. No such trend was observed in areas barren of L. fortunei. It is suggested that higher invertebrate growth is associated with enhanced substrate complexity and, probably, the transfer of organic matter from the plankton to the sediments due to the mussels<e2><80><99> feces and pseudofeces. Some of the adverse ecosystem-wide effects of filter-feeding invasive mussels observed in European and North American water bodies may be offset in the Paran<c3><a1> by the extremely high loads of organic matter in these turbid waters.},

abstract={To assess the trophic impact of the planktonic larvae of the invasive Asian bivalve Limnoperna fortunei, introduced in South America around 1990, we investigated the gut contents of fish larvae collected at monthly intervals between October 2000 and March 2001 at three locations along a 600 km stretch of the Paran<c3><a1> River, and during November 2004 in two areas of marginal lagoons connected to the river near the city of San Nicol<c3><a1>s, Argentina. Zooplankton was also collected in the lagoons in 2004. In total, 11,956 fish larvae were retrieved, of which 1,511 were used for detailed analyses. Of the 15 fish taxa collected, 11 had veligers of L. fortunei in their gut. Fish larvae with empty guts represented 60% (San Nicol<c3><a1>s) to 72% (Paran<c3><a1> River) of the total number of fish. Proportions of feeding fish larvae with L. fortunei veligers in their guts varied between 20% (San Nicol<c3><a1>s) and 56% (Paran<c3><a1> River); in 15% of the guts analyzed, L. fortunei was the only food item recorded. For those specimens that had consumed L. fortunei larvae and any other food item, L. fortunei was the most important item in 55% (Paran<c3><a1> River) to 71% (San Nicol<c3><a1>s) of the animals in terms of biomass. No major temporal or spatial changes in the diet were observed along the Paran<c3><a1> River, but the relative biomass contribution of L. fortunei larvae differed strongly in fishes of different developmental stage. In protolarvae and mesolarvae, veligers accounted for 30<e2><80><93>35% of the gut contents. In metalarvae, veligers accounted for only 3%, indicating enhanced food supply for the earliest fish life stages. Comparison of the relative proportions of the three main zooplankton types (L. fortunei veligers, cladocerans, and copepods) in the water and in larval fish guts indicates that L. fortunei is always selected positively over the other two prey types. While our results strongly suggest that the expansion of L. fortunei results in an enhanced food supply for local fish populations, they do not necessarily imply that the overall effect on the ecosystem in general, and on the fish fauna in particular is beneficial.},

title={Macro-invertebrates in a dynamic river environment: analysis of time series from artificial substrates, using a â€˜white boxâ€™ neural network modelling method},
abstract={New statistical modelling methods, such as neural networks (NNs), allow us to take a step further in the understanding of complex relations in aquatic ecosystems. In this paper the results from the analysis of macro-invertebrate communities in a complex riverine environment are presented. We attempted to explain observed changes in species composition and abundance with neural network modelling methods and compared the results to linear regression. The NN method used is an improved form of the RF5 algorithm, developed to effectively discover numeric laws from data. RF5 uses Product Unit Networks (PUNs), which are in effect multivariate non-discrete power functions. The data set consisted of a 10-year time series of monthly samples of macro-invertebrates on artificial substrates in the rivers Rhine and Meuse in the Netherlands. During this period the invertebrate community has largely changed coinciding with theâ£invasion of Ponto-Caspian crustaceans. We used physicalâ€“chemical data and data on the abundance of the invasive taxa Corophium curvispinum and Dikerogammarus villosis to explain the observed changes in the resident invertebrate community. The analyses showed temperature, abundance of invasive taxa and peak discharges as important factors. Comparison of the results from NN modelling to linear regression revealed that the factors temperature and abundance of Dikerogammarusvillosis explained equally well in both cases. Only the neural network was able to use information on peak discharge and timing of the peak in the previous winter to improve model performances. Neural networks are known to yield excellent modelling results, a drawback however is their lack of transparency or their â€˜black boxâ€™ character. The use of relatively easy interpretable (white box) PUNs allows us to investigate the extracted relations in more detail and can enhance our understanding of ecosystem functioning. Our results show that peak discharges might be an important factor structuring invertebrate communities in rivers and hint on the existence of interacting effects from invasive species and discharge peaks. They finally show the value of biological data sets that are collected over a long period and in a highly standardised way.},

abstract={Recent biological inventory data shows severe declines in freshwater mussel abundance and biodiversity in the Conasauga River Basin in Northwest Georgia, USA. Based on assessments of habitat conditions, mussel populations should be sustainable. We conducted a study of sediment and water quality to evaluate the impact of anthropogenic contamination on mussel populations. Permeable membrane devices (PMD), polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS(TM)), conventional water and sediment quality analyses, and stable nitrogen isotope ratio analyses (<ce><b4>^sup 15^N) of snails and sediments were used to assess sediment and water quality at target sites throughout the basin. Ambient concentrations of organic contaminants in water were well below any aquatic life criteria; concentrations of some nutrients were detected above aquatic life criteria levels. Most mussel species in the river are endangered or threatened; therefore, snails were collected for <ce><b4>^sup 15^N analyses. Mean <ce><b4>^sup 15^N values for snails collected at forested upper watershed sites (national forest areas) were significantly lower than <ce><b4>^sup 15^N values from snails in agricultural areas. <ce><b4>^sup 15^N values for raw cow manure and manure-treated soil were similar to <ce><b4>^sup 15^N values for snails collected in agricultural areas. Dissolved nitrate from water samples had elevated <ce><b4>^sup 15^N values similar to the upper range of <ce><b4>^sup 15^N values for snails in agricultural areas. Data, particularly stable nitrogen isotope data, indicates that a land use change from national forest land to agriculture alters nitrogen sources to the basin and snails. Implications of nutrient release on freshwater molluscan reproduction, growth, and survival are discussed.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Comparative vulnerability to predators, and induced defense responses, of eastern oysters Crassostrea virginica and non-native Crassostrea ariakensis oysters in Chesapeake Bay},
abstract={Management agencies are considering introducing the Suminoe oyster Crassostrea ariakensis into Chesapeake Bay, USA. It is unknown if the growth of feral populations of this non-native oyster would be regulated by the same predators that once controlled the abundance of the native eastern oyster C. virginica. In laboratory studies, we compared the relative susceptibility of juvenile diploids (shell height < 25 mm) of both oyster species to invertebrate predators of eastern oyster juveniles. Predators included four species of mud crabs [Rhithropanopeus harrisii (carapace width 7-11 mm), Eurypanopeus depressus (6-21 mm), Dyspanopeus sayi (8-20 mm), and Panopeus herbstii (9-29 mm)], the blue crab Callinectes sapidus (35-65 mm), and two sizes of polyclad flatworms (Stylochus ellipticus and possibly Euplana gracilis; planar area 5 mm2 and ~14 to 88 mm2). All four species of mud crab and the blue crab preyed significantly (ANOVA, P = 0.05) more on C. ariakensis than on C. virginica, but predation by flatworms of both sizes did not differ significantly between oyster species. The greater susceptibility of C. ariakensis to crab predation was likely due to its shell compression strength being 64% lower than that of C. virginica (P = 0.005). To test for predator-induced enhancement of shell strength, we held oysters of both species for 54 days in the presence of, but protected from, C. sapidus and R. harrisii. Crabs were fed congeneric oysters twice weekly within each aquarium. Compared to controls, shell strength of C. virginica exposed to R. harrisii increased significantly (P < 0.043), as did shell strength of both oyster species exposed to C. sapidus (P < 0.01). Despite the changes in shell strength by both oyster species in the presence of C. sapidus, the shell of C. ariakensis remained 57% weaker than C. virginica. We conclude that, because C. ariakensis exposed to predators continued to have a weaker shell relative to C. virginica, the natural suite of crab and flatworm predators in Chesapeake Bay will likely serve to control the abundance of feral C. ariakensis. We caution that the situation in the natural environment may be sufficiently different in some locations that C. ariakensis may be able to compensate for its greater vulnerability to crab predation and hence become a nuisance species.

abstract={ABSTRACT Pseudanodonta complanata is listed as 'Near Threatened' on the IUCN Red List (IUCN, 2006) and is a species of conservation priority on the UK Biodiversity Action Plan. The UK is host to some of the largest populations of this species, but little is known about their reproductive biology. Two populations were studied in the Great Ouse catchment and the Waveney and Yare catchment, East Anglia, UK. Both populations are reproductively active, producing viable glochidia. Small mussels (<30<c2><a0>mm length) in both catchments indicate that recruitment is occurring. A short non-gravid period in May is followed by three months of glochidial formation in June, July and August; by September mussels contain mature glochidia ready for release the following April. Females brood between 5,000 and 50,000 glochidia, and this scales with mussel length L (mm) as: n gloch âˆL2.1 . The sex ratio is skewed towards females (2.5 females:1 male), and males are larger than females. No hermaphrodites were found during the histological examination of the gonads of 24 mussels. The in vivo examination of demibranchs is shown to be an effective nonsacrificial means of determining sex and gravidity. Conservation recommendations include: minimizing management operations in river stretches containing large populations; avoiding forms of management which preferentially remove large mussels (i.e. males and the most fecund females); performing management during the non-gravid period to avoid causing the premature release of glochidia; leaving sufficient time between management operations for populations to recover; and temporarily translocating mussels to refugia during management operations.},

abstract={The muskellunge was introduced in the Saint John River system from stockings in a headwater lake in the 1970s. They have migrated down the system as far as the river<e2><80><99>s first dam, Mactaquac Hydroelectric Facility, at Fredericton and appear to have established several reproducing populations along the river. This exotic invader represents a potential threat to the severely depleted Atlantic salmon stocks in the river. We radio-tracked muskellunge over a 2-year period in the middle reaches. Home ranges extended to <e2><88><bc>100<c2><a0>km in both riverine and lacustrine areas, including 78% of individuals trans-located upstream of the dam making their way back through the dam successfully. Downstream of the dam, home ranges were <25<c2><a0>km. No spawning areas were detected. An isotope analyses of diet indicated that the large sub-adults and adults had established the greatest proportion of their biomass in a more 15N depleted environment typical of areas farther upstream. Isotope mixing models could not accurately determine the proportion of Atlantic salmon smolts that may have been consumed by muskellunge, but anadromous salmon had <e2><89><a4>7% probabilities of being in the diet. A bioenergetics model suggested <e2><89><a4>5% of the annual food intake by muskellunge occurs during the smolt out-migration period. For the Saint John River, the impacts of growing numbers of muskellunge are multi-faceted creating a complex management challenge. Muskellunge appear to minimally increase predation risk for Atlantic salmon smolts while their increasing numbers are creating a growing recreational fishery and potential threat to the native fish community and ecosystem.},

title={Temporal and spatial variability in stable isotope compositions of a freshwater mussel: implications for biomonitoring and ecological studies},
abstract={Stable isotopes can be used to elucidate ecological relationships in community and trophic studies. Findings are calibrated against baselines, e.g. from a producer or primary consumer, assumed to act as a reference to the isotopic context created by spatio-temporal attributes such as geography, climate, nutrient, and energy sources. The ability of an organism to accurately represent a community base depends on how, and over what time-scale, it assimilates ambient materials. Freshwater mussels have served as references for trophic studies of freshwater communities and as indicators of change in nutrient pollution load or source. Their suitability as reference animals has not yet been fully explored, however. We conducted a series of studies examining the suitability of freshwater mussels as isotopic baselines, using their ability to reflect variation in ambient nutrient loads as a case scenario. (1) We analyzed bivalve foot tissue <ce><b4>15N and <ce><b4>13C from 22 stream reaches in the Piedmont region of North Carolina, USA to show that compositions varied substantially among locations. Site mean bivalve <ce><b4>13C values correlated with site ambient particulate organic matter (POM) <ce><b4>13C values, and site mean bivalve <ce><b4>15N values correlated with site ambient water dissolved <ce><b4>15N-NO3 values. (2) Similarity of results among sample types demonstrated that the minimally invasive hemolymph sample is a suitable substitute for foot tissue in <ce><b4>15N analyses, and that small sample sizes generate means representative of a larger population. Both findings can help minimize the impact of sampling on imperiled freshwater mussel populations. (3) In a bivalve transplantation study we showed that hemolymph <ce><b4>15N compositions responded to a shift in ambient dissolved <ce><b4>15N-NO3, although slowly. The tissue turnover time for bivalve hemolymph was 113<c2><a0>days. We conclude that bivalves serve best as biomonitors of chronic, rather than acute, fluctuations in stream nutrient loads, and provide initial evidence of their suitability as time-integrated isotopic baselines for community studies.},

title={Application of Risk Assessment and Decision Analysis to Aquatic Nuisance Species},
abstract={The spread of nonindigenous (nonnative) species introduced into the United States is a significant and growing national problem and results in lost agricultural productivity, increased health problems, native species extinctions, and expensive prevention and eradication efforts. Thousands of nonindigenous species have either become established or spread, and introduction of aquatic nuisance species (ANS) into freshwater lakes threaten aquatic biodiversity. Expanding global trade is likely to increase the number of species that are spread across the globe, so the need to develop an approach to predict potential ANS invasions is great. Risk assessments currently being used to assess ANS risk rely on qualitative or semiquantitative information and expert opinion; thus, such approaches lack transparency and repeatability. A more quantitative approach is needed to augment the qualitative approaches currently in use. A quantitative approach with the use of the traditional ecological risk assessment (traditional ERA) framework combined with decision analysis tools was developed for assessing ANS risks in which the causative ecological risk agent is an organism rather than a chemical. This paper presents a systematic risk assessment framework that includes structured decision analysis to help organize and analyze pertinent data, state assumptions, address uncertainties in estimating the probability of an undesired ANS introduction, or spread and integrate these outputs with stakeholder values. This paper also describes when and how decision analysis tools can be used in such assessments for ANS. This framework and methodology will enable risk managers to systematically evaluate and compare alternatives and actions supporting ANS risk management and thus credibly prioritize resources.

title={Low-Nitrate-Days (LND), a Potential Indicator of Cyanobacteria Blooms in a Eutrophic Hardwater Reservoir},
abstract={When nitrate was low in a hypereutrophic, hardwater reservoir, cyanobacteria proliferated into blooms. Based on this observation an index was developed that relates an easily measurable variable, the period of Low-Nitrate-Days (LND), to the period when nuisance cyanobacteria (blue-greens) proliferate and "bloom". The bloom indicator LND (d times yr-1) was defined as the period of time during summer and early fall when nitrate concentration is below a lake-specific threshold. This concept was valuable in Fanshawe Lake, a southern Ontario reservoir of the Thames River in the Lake Erie catchment basin, where traditional bloom indicators are rare. A nitrate threshold of 1 to 2 mg times L-1 is supported by occasional observations of chlorophyll (Chl) concentration, blue-green biomass, visual inspection, and photographic documentation. Fanshawe Lake's water quality (phosphorus, Chl, and Secchi disk transparency) varied from summer to summer and LND ranged from 0 to 175 d times yr-1 with a long-term average of 62 d times yr-1 for 38 years. LND was positively and significantly correlated with average summer total phosphorus concentration (available for 8 years), but not Chl (n = 6) nor transparency (n = 11), possibly because of an invasion by the zebra mussel Dreissena. LND values agreed well with cyanobacteria biomass indicators predicted from other models. Significant relationships with 38 years of flows and the climatic index (winter North Atlantic Oscillation) reveal that during high-flow years estimated cyanobacteria blooms are infrequent, while during low-flow years bloom periods are extended and the water quality is poor. Investigations on other man-made lakes and river sections of the Thames River, and preliminary studies on natural lakes with differing trophic states show that LND may be a useful variable in all lakes and reservoirs where nutrient limitation switches from phosphorus to nitrogen during summer.},

title={Interspecific Comparison of the Mechanical Properties of Mussel Byssus},
abstract={Byssally tethered mussels are found in a variety of habitats, including rocky intertidal, salt marsh, subtidal, and hydrothermal vents. One key to the survival of mussels in these communities is a secure attachment, achieved by the production of byssal threads. Although many studies have detailed the unique biomechanical properties of byssal threads, only a few prevalent species have been examined. This study assesses the variation in the mechanical properties of byssus in a broad range of mussel species from diverse environments, including intertidul and subtidal Mytilus edulis, Modiolus modiolus, Geukensia demissa, Bathymodiolus thermophilus, and Dreissena polymorpha. A tensometer was used to measure quasi-static and dynamic mechanical properties of individual threads, and several aspects of morphology were quantified. The results indicate that thread mechanical properties vary among mussel species, and several novel properties were observed. For example, of the species examined, D. polymorpha threads were the strongest, stiffest, least resilient, and fastest to recover after partial deformation. Threads of M. modiolus were characterized by the presence of two distinct yield regions prior to tensile failure. This comparative study not only provides insight into the ecological limitations and evolution of mussels, but also suggests new models for the design of novel biomimetic polymers.

title={What's the (Critical Control) Point of HACCP: Minimizing the Spread of Aquatic Invasive Species},
abstract={Prevention continues to prove the best defense against the mounting impacts of aquatic invasive species like zebra mussels and silver carp. The Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) process has been used for years to reduce the risk of food contamination, but its use to minimize the spread of invasive species is still evolving. HACCP provides for a step-by-step analysis of a particular operation to identify vulnerabilities for inadvertent transport of unwanted species, and then helps pinpoint the most effective opportunities for closing those pathways. But identifying critical control points and associated control methods during initial development of a HACCP plan isn't enough. The continuing flow of new invasive species into the region requires frequent updates to ensure that all relevant risks are addressed. Further, best management practices that result from HACCP only matter if they're implemented, and even then they don't always eliminate a particular risk. Therefore, a key but sometimes-neglected aspect of a HACCP plan is the associated corrective action that can be triggered when an invasive species control limit isn't met. A number of existing HACCP plans can help illustrate how to make this process successful. If developed properly and implemented effectively, HACCP can help fish culture facilities avoid costly operating restrictions and serious environmental impacts. More information and resources for HACCP plan development can be found at www.haccp-nrm.org.},

title={Hydroinformatics techniques in eco-environmental modelling and management},
abstract={The high complexity of aquatic ecosystems and the multiple processes involved, make the development of ecohydraulics and eco-environmental models a challenging subject. Conventionally, computer-based models use a mathematical formulation for the processes involved which are then solved by numerical methods. These models are often derived based on the assumption of spatial homogeneity and conservation principles of mass, momentum and energy. Development of these models often demands a clear understanding of the processes involved. However, the above assumptions are easily violated when spatial heterogeneity, individual species behaviour and local interactions play a significant role in the system dynamics. In particular for eco-environmental systems, knowledge on local interactions that determine the overall system behaviour is not always available. Although the rapid advances of data-driven techniques have recently made great contributions to water-environment related research, data on ecosystems are often quite limited, which restricts the application of data mining methods to eco-environmental system modelling. In addition, no modelling - also not black-box modelling - can be undertaken without having at least some understanding of the basic processes and mechanisms involved. It is always advisable to start exploring any dataset using conventional statistical techniques, as elaborated in this paper for a case study on Western Xiamen Bay, China. Neural network trimming was then used to establish the dominant factors; it was shown that a relatively simple ANN model was quite capable of capturing the essential features, provided the right input parameters are chosen. Examples of integrated approaches to ecohydraulics modelling coupling formulations with cellular automata and physical equations with fuzzy rules are presented for applications on eutrophication modelling of Taihu Lake in China, competitive growths and colonization of two underwater macrophytes in Lake Veluwe in The Netherlands, and forecasting of algal blooms in the Dutch coastal waters on the North Sea. A mussel dynamics model developed for the Upper Mississippi River in the USA demonstrates the feasibility of individual based modelling in ecosystem dynamics. Numerical models are quite capable of simulating the abiotic aquatic environment, including complicated fluid flow and transport mechanisms. However, when it comes to simulating the biotic and ecosystem dynamics, the interaction of individual species with their environment, as well as the interactions amongst species, has to be taken into account. The future of ecohydraulics and eco-environmental modelling thus seems to lie in the integration of different paradigms and techniques, which is the core content of the hydroinformatics discipline.},

Algal biomass developing on each NDS after ~3<c2><a0>weeks of exposure in each month was assessed by quantifying chlorophyll a + phaeophyton pigments. In both July and August, strong responses to N + P and N enrichments were observed in the majority of ponds, while P had no stimulatory effect. These responses correspond well with low atomic ratios (1<e2><80><93>18) of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) to total phosphorus (TP) in ambient surface waters. The results suggest that conditions in the kettle ponds develop whereby nitrogen is the primary limiting nutrient to periphyton growth. While this may be a seasonal phenomenon, it has implications for nutrient management in individual ponds and within the larger watershed.},

title={Ionic and Acid-Base Consequences of Exposure to Increased Salinity in the Zebra Mussel, Dreissena polymorpha},
abstract={Dreissena polymorpha, an invasive freshwater bivalve, displays physiological characteristics that reflect its ancestry in brackish water, yet it has limited ability to withstand modest increases in salinity. We examined changes in hemolymph ion concentrations and acid-base variables in mussels transferred to and incubated in 10% artificial seawater (ASW) for 7 days and then returned to pondwater (PW) for a further 7 days. Hemolymph was sampled (10 animals per sample period) every 4 h for the first 24-h incubation and at 72 h and 168 h for both the transfer to 10% ASW and the transfer back to PW. The initial response to transfer to 10% ASW was a rapid attainment of an apparent isoosmotic steady state, with most hemolymph ion concentrations rising and attaining steady state within 12 h. Hemolymph magnesium rose more slowly, and hemolymph calcium declined despite an increase in its concentration in the bathing medium. Hemolymph pH rose significantly during the first 24 h, from 7.96 to 8.25, as a result of increases in bicarbonate; pH subsequently returned to normal through increases in PCO^sub 2^. When animals were returned to PW after 7 days' incubation in ASW, the response of the major hemolymph ions was largely the reverse of that effected by the transfer to ASW. Hemolymph pH was not altered significantly until after 72 h in PW, when declines in bicarbonate lowered the pH to 7.73. Strong ion difference (SID) was related significantly to hemolymph pH. Hemolymph calcium and magnesium showed a reciprocal relationship throughout both transfer and incubation. Solubility interactions between sulfate and calcium and magnesium may be important in determining calcium availability in solution. The Na/K ratio in hemolymph was maintained within relatively narrow bounds throughout the procedure and may contribute to the mussels' ability to volume-regulate during an osmotic challenge. Overall, the responses of D. polymorpha to modest changes in salinity were largely the result of passive processes. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Could Limnoperna fortunei be worse than Dreissena polymorpha? potential spread and ecosystem impacts},
abstract={Although taxonomically unrelated, the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) and golden mussel (Limnoperna fortunei) have very similar life histories, suggesting that similar vectors are involved in their spread. Both are sessile, byssate bivalves with a planktonic larval stage and high reproductive capacity. Adults of both species attain extremely high densities physically changing the substrate, and because they are such effective suspension feeders they greatly enhance benthic-pelagic coupling and act as powerful ecosystem engineers. We compare environmental limits and ecological impacts of the well studied D. polymorpha with the lesser known L. fortunei to predict the potential spread and ecosystem impacts of the golden mussels. Limnoperna fortunei reaches population densities similar to or higher than D. polymorpha. It has comparable filtering rates and therefore may have similar or even stronger ecosystem impacts. In addition, L. fortunei has broader environmental tolerances than D. polymorpha, including higher water temperatures, lower pH levels, lower calcium content and water pollution. Therefore, L. fortunei may be much more successful than D. polymorpha in regions dominated by acidic, soft and contaminated waters. We predict that in the near future L. fortunei will colonize the southern and central parts of North America, Southern Europe, Northern Africa, and Australia, as well as expand its distribution in South America and Asia. Although to date D. polymorpha is considered the most aggressive freshwater invader, soon many waterbodies that are already affected by D. polymorpha may get another, even more aggressive invader.},

title={Hosts and parasites as aliens},
abstract={Abstract Over the past decades, various free-living animals (hosts) and their parasites have invaded recipient areas in which they had not previously occurred, thus gaining the status of aliens or exotics. In general this happened to a low extent for hundreds of years. With variable frequency, invasions have been followed by the dispersal and establishment of non-indigenous species, whether host or parasite. In the literature thus far, colonizations by both hosts and parasites have not been treated and reviewed together, although both are usually interwoven in various ways. As to those factors permitting invasive success and colonization strength, various hypotheses have been put forward depending on the scientific background of respective authors and on the conspicuousness of certain invasions. Researchers who have tried to analyse characteristic developmental patterns, the speed of dispersal or the degree of genetic divergence in populations of alien species have come to different conclusions. Among parasitologists, the applied aspects of parasite invasions, such as the negative effects on economically important hosts, have long been at the centre of interest. In this contribution, invasions by hosts as well as parasites are considered comparatively, revealing many similarities and a few differences. Two helminths, the liver fluke, Fasciola hepatica, of cattle and sheep and the swimbladder nematode, Anguillicola crassus, of eels are shown to be useful as model parasites for the study of animal invasions and environmental global change. Introductions of F. hepatica have been associated with imports of cattle or other grazing animals. In various target areas, susceptible lymnaeid snails serving as intermediate hosts were either naturally present and/or were introduced from the donor continent of the parasite (Europe) and/or from other regions which were not within the original range of the parasite, partly reflecting progressive stages of a global biota change. In several introduced areas, F. hepatica co-occurs with native or exotic populations of the congeneric F. gigantica, with thus far unknown implications. Over the fluke's extended range, in addition to domestic stock animals, wild native or naturalized mammals can also serve as final hosts. Indigenous and displaced populations of F. hepatica, however, have not yet been studied comparatively from an evolutionary perspective. A. crassus, from the Far East, has invaded three continents, without the previous naturalization of its natural host Anguilla japonica, by switching to the respective indigenous eel species. Local entomostrac crustaceans serve as susceptible intermediate hosts. The novel final hosts turned out to be naive in respect to the introduced nematode with far reaching consequences for the parasite's morphology (size), abundance and pathogenicity. Comparative infection experiments with Japanese and European eels yielded many differences in the hosts' immune defence, mirroring coevolution versus an abrupt host switch associated with the introduction of the helminth. In other associations of native hosts and invasive parasites, the elevated pathogenicity of the parasite seems to result from other deficiencies such as a lack of anti-parasitic behaviour of the na<c3><af>ve host compared to the donor host which displays distinct behavioural patterns, keeping the abundance of the parasite low. From the small amount of available literature, it can be concluded that the adaptation of certain populations of the novel host to the alien parasite takes several decades to a century or more. Summarizing all we know about hosts and parasites as aliens, tentative patterns and principles can be figured out, but individual case studies teach us that generalizations should be avoided.

title={Dispersion and Ecological Impact of the Invasive Freshwater Bivalve Limnoperna fortunei in the Rio de la Plata Watershed and Beyond},
abstract={Limnoperna fortunei is a freshwater bivalve that invaded South America through Rio de la Plata estuary in 1989 and has since become a major macrofouling pest. Along the Parana-Paraguay waterway, which hosts intense boat traffic, L. fortunei has moved upstream at an average rate of of 250 km per year. In contrast, along the Uruguay river, where boat traffic is restricted to the lowermost 200 km section, upstream colonization is almost 10-times slower. This suggests that attachment to vessels is by far the most important dispersion mechanism. It is suggested that the Amazon, Orinoco and Magdalena basins are under high risk of invasion by this mussel, especially through their estuarine gateways. All South American basins host innumerable water bodies with favorable conditions for L. fortunei's colonization. Known ecological tolerance limits of the mussel also suggest that it may colonize much of the area from Central America to Canada, including waters that due to their low calcium contents, high temperature and pollution levels, and low oxygen are inadequate for the survival of Dreissena polymorpha. Despite it's remarkable geographic expansion and its extremely high population densities, L. fortunei's ecological effects have received very little attention so far. It is suggested that the 2.4-fold increase in Argentine landings of freshwater fish between 1992-1993 and 2000-2001 may be associated with the introduction of this prey species.},

Nonindigenous species account for 4.8% of all species found and up to 96% of total bio one fourth <c2><ac>mass. Invasive benthic omnivores, the alien amphipods Gmelinoides fasciatus and Pontogammarus robustoides and the predaceous fish Perccottus glenii with their versatile diets strongly affect the community structure. Invasive sessile seston-feeders that directly (through grazing and water clearance) and indirectly (through recycling of nutrients) interact with other ecosystem components, are mainly represented by the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha, which affect the structure of benthic and planktonic communities as well as benthicpelagic coupling. The invasive predatory cladocerans Cercopagis pengoi and Evadne anonyx and larvae of D. polymorpha are only temporary components in the zooplankton, which is limiting their overall effect. Alien benthic bioturbators, the polychaetes Marenzelleria neglecta and the oligochaete Tuhifi'coides pseudogaster account for a high proportion of total abundance and biomass but their effects an native species need further research.},

title={Biological invasions: the case of planorbid snails},
abstract={Abstract A large number of planorbid snails are now commonly transported by man mainly through the aquatic plant trade. However, only a restricted number of species establish viable populations in a new habitat and a more restricted number spread. Only five planorbid species can be ranked in this last category and can be considered as pests because of their role in the transmission of parasites to humans or domestic animals: Biomphalaria glabrata, B. straminea, B. tenagophila, B. pfeifferi and Indoplanorbis exustus. The neotropical B. glabrata, B. straminea and B. tenagophila have proven their capacity to invade another continent sometimes creating new transmission foci. The African B. pfeifferi and the Indian I. exustus have also expanded their distribution area with long-distance dispersal. Other planorbid species, i.e. Helisoma duryi, Amerianna carinata and Gyraulus spp. have been able to establish viable populations, but not to spread, presumably because they are limited to specific habitats or/and display poor competitive abilities.

abstract={The development, testing, and application of a probabilistic model framework for the light attenuation coefficient for downwelling irradiance (K^sub d^) and Secchi disc transparency (SD) that resolves the effects of several light attenuating constituents, including phytoplankton and nonliving particles (tripton), is documented. The model is consistent with optical theory, partitioning the magnitudes of the light attenuating processes of absorption and scattering according to the contributions of attenuating constituents as simple summations. The probabilistic framework accommodates variations in the character and concentrations of these constituents and ambient conditions during measurements, and recognizes a linear relationship between the magnitudes of absorption and scattering by tripton. The model is tested and applied for a 21 km reach of the Seneca River, New York, that features optical gradients caused by an intervening hypereutrophic lake and dam, and a severe infestation of the exotic zebra mussel. The model is applied to resolve the roles of phytoplankton and tripton in regulating measured longitudinal patterns of SD along the study reach of the river and increases in SD since the zebra mussel invasion, and to predict decreases in K^sub d^ since the invasion.

title={Recent Changes and Patterns in the Water Chemistry of Lake Simcoe},
abstract={After the Great Lakes, Lake Simcoe is the largest lake in southern Ontario. Located within a 1 hour drive of half the population of Ontario, there is currently major concern over the impact of rapid urbanization on the nutrient status of the lake. However, despite a more than doubling of the human population in the Lake Simcoe watershed over the past two decades, average total phosphorus (TP) levels were lower in 2000-2003 compared with 1980-1983 at six of eight lake stations, and declines were significant at the most nutrient-enriched near-shore sites located in Kempenfelt Bay (0.29 mu g/L/year) and Cook's Bay (0.31-0.41 mu g/L/year). Total P concentrations varied two-fold across the lake, and phytoplankton bio-volume followed a similar pattern, with greatest phytoplankton abundance occurring at high TP sites, particularly in Cook's Bay. Nevertheless, steep declines in bio-volume occurred at all sites beginning in the mid-1990s, and water clarity (Secchi disk depth) improved concurrently such that Secchi depths were 40-80% greater in 2000-2003 compared with 1980-1983. Zebra mussels, which became established in Lake Simcoe around 1995, likely contributed to decreased phytoplankton bio-volume and related improvements in water clarity, which began during the mid-1990s. Despite major reductions in phytoplankton bio-volume, average rates of dissolved oxygen (DO) depletion (18 m-bottom zone; normalized to 4 degree C) did not change substantially over time, and were similar in 2000-2003 (average 1.25 plus or minus 0.21 g O sub(2)/m super(3)/month) compared with 1980-1983 (average 1.26 plus or minus 0.19 g O sub(2)/m super(3)/month). In contrast, minimum, end-of-summer DO levels (18 m-bottom) increased slightly over the period of record. Although there has been some improvement in end-of-summer DO availability, DO concentrations continue to decline to levels that are limiting to many fish species (e.g., 3.8 mg O sub(2)/L in 2001) by the end of the summer stratified period.},

title={Impact of Oligotrophication, Temperature, and Water Levels on Walleye Habitat in the Bay of Quinte, Lake Ontario},
abstract={Recent environmental changes in the Bay of Quinte, Lake Ontario, have coincided with a decline in the stocks of walleye Sander vitreus. Suitable habitat supply was estimated in three sections of the bay during the summers of 1972-2001 to assess its role in the decline. An empirical model was developed to predict suitable habitat area for walleyes based on their preferences for cool water and low light intensity. The results indicated that lack of suitable light limits walleye habitat in the bay. Walleye habitat in the shallow upper bay has decreased at the rate of 34 ha/year since the invasion of dreissenid mussels in 1994, while that in the middle and lower bays has remained abundant. Walleye stocks and suitable habitat in the upper bay have both declined since the early 1990s. However, this pattern has not been consistent through time and suggests that other factors have also affected the Bay of Quinte walleye population. The analyses developed here can be used as a tool to enhance the assessment of walleye habitat dynamics in the Bay of Quinte and allow us to examine the impact of oligotrophication on the habitat of an important recreational and commercial species.},

abstract={The conspicuous shifts in summertime values of common measures of water qualify that have persisted for 10 years (1993 to 2002) in the Seneca River, New York, as a result of the zebra mussel invasion are documented. Resolution of patterns in time and space is supported by water quality monitoring that extends back to the late 1970s. Patterns are evaluated to describe the stability of impacts and quantify metabolic activity of the invader. The water quality impacts that have persisted unabated for 10 years since the invasion are the most severe documented for a river in North America. Changes in summer median conditions since the invasion include: (1) a 16-fold decrease in chlorophyll concentration (Chl), (2) a 2.5-fold increase in Secchi disc transparency, (3) a 17-fold increase in soluble reactive phosphorus concentration, (4) a 3.7-fold increase in total ammonia concentration, (5) a greater than 25 percent decrease in dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration, and (6) a decrease in pH of 0.55 units. The strength of these signatures has been driven by anthropogenic influences that include upstream nutrient loading and morphometric modifications of the river, and the functioning of Cross Lake, through which the river flows. This hypereutrophic lake sustains dense zebra mussel populations and related water quality impacts in the river downstream of the lake outflow by acting as a source of veligers and suitable food for this bivalve. Evidence is presented that levels of metabolic activity of the zebra mussel in this river have been resource limited, manifested through increased consumption of Chl and DO with increased delivery of these constituents in the lake's outflow.

title={Changes in the freshwater mussel (Bivalvia: Unionidae) fauna of the Bear Creek system of Northwest Alabama and Northeast Mississippi},
abstract={Drastic reductions in diversity and abundance of mussel populations are documented in many systems. Bear Creek, located in northwest Alabama and northeast Mississippi, has seen changes to its fauna, possibly the result of impoundment, channelization, wastewater discharge, and sedimentation from such sources such as strip mining, agriculture, and silviculture. The most obvious influences have been impoundment of the lowermost 32 km of Bear Creek by Pickwick Reservoir of Tennessee River, the construction of four dams within the system, construction of a 29-km-long channel designed to limit flooding, and bank destabilization. Mussels are absent from much of the system and faunal composition has apparently been altered where mussels persist, based on comparison to limited previous studies. The most notable changes are the loss of Cumberlandian species diversity and the apparent increase in Ohioan species diversity. We sampled 40 stations in the Bear Creek system and report 32 mussel species live or fresh dead, including 3 Cumberlandian species, and 2 others weathered dead. Fourteen of these species were not reported in two earlier studies. During this study the most depauperate populations were upstream of Bear Creek km 41.0 and in tributaries. No mussels were collected immediately downstream of dams, and diversity gradually increased downstream from the lowermost main channel dam until 28 species occurred together in a free-flowing reach shortly before entering Pickwick Reservoir. One weathered dead zebra mussel, Dreisenna polymorpha, was also collected, representing a new tributary record. The population of Epioblasma brevidens in Bear Creek is the only population of that species known in the lower Tennessee River system, and the population of Lexingtonia dolabelloides, another new tributary record, is one of only two populations of that species known downstream of Paint Rock River.},

title={Recent Increases in Lake Erie Plankton Biomass: Roles of External Phosphorus Loading and Dreissenid Mussels},
abstract={Eutrophication in Lake Erie stimulated passage of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement (1972), reducing external phosphorus (P) loading and limiting excessive growth of plankton. As P-loading decreased to target levels in the mid-1980s, plankton populations declined. With the expansion of dreissenid mussels throughout Lake Erie in the early 1990s, phytoplankton population biomass was expected to decrease even further. We compared our recent plankton biomass data collected from May-October from 80 stations distributed in Lake Erie's three basins with previously published data to test whether plankton biomass decreased. Since a minimum in 1996 (0.74 mg/L), annual average phytoplankton biomass has increased to levels comparable to the late 1970s (4.1 mg/L in 1978 and 1998), whereas western basin zooplankton biomass has increased at a slower rate from 1996-2000 (0.10-0.14 mg/L). Recurrence of cyanobacterial blooms also suggests the lake has returned to more eutrophic conditions. Plankton biomass values from 1970 through 2001 are positively correlated with external P loading, except for zooplankton in the central basin and phytoplankton in the eastern basin. Recycling of P by dreissenids is partially responsible for the recent increases in algae, requiring additional non-point source P controls.},

title={The global change of continental aquatic systems: dominant impacts of human activities},
abstract={Continental aquatic systems, particularly rivers, are exposed to major changes due to human pressures. Some changes are voluntary such as flow regulation and the fragmentation of river courses, both due to damming, or the water consumption particularly in dry regions, which results in a partial to complete dry-up of some rivers (neo-arheism). Other changes result from indirect impacts of other human activities, and include: sediment unbalance of river systems, chemical contamination, acidification, eutrophication, thermal unbalance, radioactive contamination, microbial contamination, and aquatic species introduction/invasion. These changes can be regarded as syndromes which have now reached a global amplitude, even in less populated regions, as the result of damning, mining and of long-range atmospheric pollution, thus defining a new era, the Anthropocene, where continental aquatic systems are no longer controlled by earth systems processes but by human activities. Each region of the globe has developed specific patterns of syndromes trajectories that can be reconstructed from historical analysis and through environmental archives. These trajectories reveal multiple types of human responses to aquatic environmental issues (e.g. water quality), usually lasting 10 to 50 years for the successful ones. The reactions of the earth system to such major changes of fluxes (water, energy, nutrients, carbon, pollutants) via the continental waterscape, the land-ocean interactions, the water bodies-atmosphere interactions, are likely to take place over a longer time scale (100-1,000 years) yet are poorly addressed by scientists and not considered in Integrated Water Management, particularly as concerns the coastal zone.},

abstract={The gametogenic cycle of three size classes of the freshwater mussel Dreissena polymorpha was investigated by histological examination during 2000 and 2001 at Lough Derg. Co. Limerick, Ireland. This study provided a full staging method for the study of the reproductive cycle of the zebra mussel. Gonads and gamete development were observed in mussels in all months and in all sizes of mussel from 6.0 mm up to 25.9 mm long. Gonads (non ripe) were only observed in a small percentage (3.4%) of individuals smaller than 6.0 mm and only in females. Thus, mussels become sexually mature and are able to reproduce from at least 6.0 mm long and during their first year, characterizing a fast-growing population. It also appeared that only one period of successful reproduction existed, as only during 3 months of the year was there synchronicity in the gonadal development of males and females. Variations in the sex ratio were observed with a shift from female dominance in September 2000 to equal proportions of male and female in October 2001. Gamete development in males appeared to be more dependent on external factors, such as water temperature, illustrating a potentially important difference in the reproductive physiology of male and female zebra mussel.},

title={Food quality controls reproduction of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha)},
abstract={Species such as Dreissena polymorpha sometimes contribute substantially in the transfer of primary to secondary production. During the ontogenetic cycle, the reproductive investment of adult mussels is one of the main parameters that affect recruitment success. We studied how food quality and temperature affect the reproductive investment in term of egg mass of D. polymorpha in a lake by sampling mussels monthly from 4<c2><a0>m and 15<c2><a0>m depths. Temperature affected reproduction directly and also indirectly through the food. To assess whether temperature and/or food conditions led to the differences observed in mussels sampled from the two depths, mussels were reared in the laboratory under two different temperature regimes for 3<c2><a0>months, simulating the temperature of the lake at 4<c2><a0>m and 15<c2><a0>m depth. Possible effects of food quality were tested at each temperature using four diets differing in fatty acid composition. Temperature played an important role as a trigger for spawning, and the type of diet clearly affected the reproductive investment. When the heterokont chromophyte alga Nannochloropsis limnetica, which is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and long-chained PUFAs (>C18), was fed to mussels, an increased egg mass was obtained. This result was in contrast to that found when the green alga Scenedesmus obliquus and the cyanobacterium Aphanothece sp., both of which are deficient in long-chained PUFAs, were offered as food to the mussels. Such a PUFA-dependent food quality may affect reproduction in lakes. Food quality effects vary seasonally in a lake and may be most important in summer, when low-food-quality green algae and cyanobacteria are abundant. The low biochemical quality of these blooms may affect at least the later period of gametogenesis of D. polymorpha, which reproduces from June to August.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={FISH-COMMUNITY OBJECTIVES FOR LAKE SUPERIOR},
abstract={The development of fish-community objectives for each lake is mandated by A Joint Joint Plan for Management of Great Lakes Fisheries (Great Lakes Fishery Commission 1997). That multiagency agreement also reflects a commitment to habitat protection and restoration through the following statement: The Parties must exercise their full authority and influence in every available arena to meet the ecological, chemical, and physical needs of desired fish communities. Accordingly, these fish-community objectives highlight habitat issues. The first objective summarizes the agencies' habitat concerns: Achieve no net loss of the productive capacity of habitat supporting Lake Superior fishes. Where feasible, restore habitats that have been degraded and have lost their capacity for fish production. Reduce contaminants so that all fish are safe to eat. Develop comprehensive and detailed inventories of habitats. The fish-community objectives were developed in conformity with twelve guiding principles that summarize the values and practical realities that constrain or guide fisheries management on Lake Superior. Additional objectives pertain to prey species, lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis), walleye (Stizostedion vitreum vitreum), lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens), brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), and trout (Salmonidae spp.), sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), nuisance species, and species diversity. Habitat issues impeding achievement of any objective are described. The most-pressing habitat concerns are in streams and embayments, and accordingly affect: * Tributary-spawning species, including brook trout, walleye, and lake sturgeon * Warm- or cool-water species, including yellow perch (Perca flavescens), northern pike (Esox lucius), and smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) Although numerous non-native species have invaded Lake Superior, with the effective control of sea lamprey, the offshore fish community has returned to a condition broadly similar to that which existed prior to the modern era. The agencies envision an offshore fish community dominated by lake trout as the top predator and requiring the continued control or eradication of sea lamprey.},

title={EVALUATION OF RELOCATION OF UNIONID MUSSELS TO IN SITU REFUGIA},
abstract={The aim of this study was to evaluate the recovery and survival of four species of unionid mussles [pimpleback, Quadrula pustulosa pustulosa (I. Lea, 1831); spike, Elliptio dilatata (Rafinesque, 1820); Higgins eye, Lampsilis higginsii (I. Lea, 1857); and pocketbook, Lampsilis cardium (Rafinesque, 1820)] that were experimentally relocated to in situ refugia in the St Croix River of Minnesota and Wisconsin, USA. In 1996, 150 mussels of each of the first three species (450 total) were relocated to three 5 x 5 m study grids (Site A), one near Lakeland, Minnesota, which served as a source-site control, and two in the experimental refuge 48 km upstream, near Franconia, Minnesota. In a second relocation in 1997, L. cardium was substituted for L. higginsii and 150 mussels of this and each of the other two species (450 total), were relocated to two study grids (Site B). The source site control was near Sunrise, Minnesota and the experimental refuge was 14 km downstream near Almelund, Minnesota. Mussel recovery, survival and substratum characteristics were evaluated annually at Site A for 2 years and for 3 years at Site B. Mean annual recovery of all three species ranged from 90 to 100% at Site A, and from 34 to 70% at site B. The mean annual survival of recaptured mussels ranged from 85 to 100% at Site A, and from 88 to 100% at Site B. The textural characteristics of the substratum differed significantly between the control and the two refuge locations at the beginning of the study, but did not differ from this initial status among subsequent years at Site A. At Site B, there was a significant shift in textural characteristics from large to smaller fractions over the four years. The relatively high survival of mussels during this study demonstrates the importance of proper handling and transport protocols when relocating mussels and the selection of suitable relocation habitat with stable substratum. When established correctly, in situ refugia may be a viable tool for preserving unionid mussels.},

title={Importance of Lake Ontario Embayments and Nearshore Habitats as Nurseries for Larval Fishes with Emphasis on Alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus)},
abstract={Productive embayments, areas morphometrically sheltered from open lake physical processes, were compared to less productive, exposed shorelines of the nearshore as nursery habitats for larval alewives (Alosa pseudoharengus), the principal forage fish in Lake Ontario. Species composition and densities of pelagic larval fishes were assessed with toward plankton nets at three embayments and adjacent nearshore habitats located along the New York shore, two sites in 1997 and a third site in 1998. Peak nearshore densities of larval alewives in 1997 and 1998 were compared to 1977 and 1978, a time period prior to major phosphorus reductions and the establishment of exotic dreissenid mussels in Lake Ontario. Seasonal changes in the pelagic larval fish assemblage were generally similar in the embayments; yellow perch (Perca flavescens) were prevalent in late-May shifting to co-occurrence of alewives and Lepomis spp. in June and July. At all nearshore sites, the larval fish assemblage throughout summer consisted mainly of alewives (> 65%). Densities of larval alewives peaked earlier in embayments but generally at lower densities than observed later in the nearshore. Because the amount of nearshore habitat greatly exceeds that of embayment habitat in Lake Ontario, nearshore waters served as the principal nurseries for larval alewives. However, densities of all larval fish species other than alewives (principally yellow perch and Lepomis spp.) were usually greater in embayments than the nearshore. Compared to three nearshore sites in 1977 and 1978, timing of peak densities of alewives in 1997 and 1998 were similar and temperature dependent; highest densities occurred in late July to early August after nearshore waters were greater than or equal to 18 degree C. Peak median nearshore alewife densities (larvae/100 m super(3)) in 1997 (47) and 1998 (60) were similar to those in 1977 (8 to 100) and 1978 (34 to 49). This similarity suggested a limited effect of lowered phosphorus and food web changes on peak larval alewife densities in Lake Ontario.},

abstract={Following the introduction of automobile catalysts in the middle of the Eighties in Germany there is an increasing emission of the platinum-group-metals (PGM) platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd) and rhodium (Rh). Still, it remains unclear if these metals are bioavailable for aquatic animals and to which extent they accumulate in the aquatic biosphere. Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) were maintained in water containing road dust at a concentration of 1 kg/101. Following an exposure period of 26 weeks, soft tissues of the mussels were analysed applying adsorptive cathodic stripping voltammetry (ACSV) for the determination of Pt and Rh and total-reflection X-ray fluorescence analysis after co-precipitation of Pd with mercury. This experiment revealed for the first time that all the three catalyst emitted metals were accumulated by mussels. The bioaccumulation increased in the following manner: Rh < Pt < Pd. Thus, the application of sentinel organisms in combination with modern trace analytical procedures in environmental impact studies does allow an assessment of the distribution and the degree of bioaccumulation of PGM in the environment, which is highly appreciated.},

title={The functional role of burrowing bivalves in freshwater ecosystems},
abstract={1. Freshwater systems are losing biodiversity at a rapid rate, yet we know little about the functional role of most of this biodiversity. The ecosystem roles of freshwater burrowing bivalves have been particularly understudied. Here we summarize what is known about the functional role of burrowing bivalves in the orders Unionoida and Veneroida in lakes and streams globally. 2. Bivalves filter phytoplankton, bacteria and particulate organic matter from the water column. Corbicula and sphaeriids also remove organic matter from the sediment by deposit feeding, as may some unionids. Filtration rate varies with bivalve species and size, temperature, particle size and concentration, and flow regime. 3. Bivalves affect nutrient dynamics in freshwater systems, through excretion as well as biodeposition of faeces and pseudofaeces. Excretion rates are both size and species dependent, are influenced by reproductive stage, and vary greatly with temperature and food availability. 4. Bioturbation of sediments through bivalve movements increases sediment water and oxygen content and releases nutrients from the sediment to the water column. The physical presence of bivalve shells creates habitat for epiphytic and epizoic organisms, and stabilizes sediment and provides refugia for benthic fauna. Biodeposition of faeces and pseudofaeces can alter the composition of benthic communities. 5. There is conflicting evidence concerning the role of resource limitation in structuring bivalve communities. Control by bivalves of primary production is most likely when their biomass is large relative to the water volume and where hydrologic residence time is long. Future studies should consider exactly what bivalves feed upon, whether feeding varies seasonally and with habitat, and whether significant overlap in diet occurs. In particular, we need a clearer picture of the importance of suspension versus deposit feeding and the potential advantages and tradeoffs between these two feeding modes. 6. In North America, native burrowing bivalves (Unionidae) are declining at a catastrophic rate. This significant loss of benthic biomass, coupled with the invasion of an exotic burrowing bivalve (Corbicula), may result in large alterations of ecosystem processes and functions.},

We found that (i) A. ligamentina and A. plicata displayed different seasonal changes in physiology and biochemical composition, (ii) larval brooding affected the physiology but not the biochemical composition of A. ligamentina, and (iii) A. plicata had a greater carbohydrate content and condition index than A. ligamentina. A. ligamentina and A. plicata had different patterns of ammonia excretion rate, O:N ratio, and clearance rate, while patterns of oxygen uptake rate were similar between the two species. Overall, weight specific metabolic rates were higher in A. ligamentina than in A. plicata. Both species had low protein and high carbohydrate content in early summer. Brooding specimens of A. ligamentina had lower oxygen uptake and ammonia excretion rates and higher O:N ratios than non-brooding specimens. Differences in condition and carbohydrate content between the two species could explain some of the species-specific mortalities observed since the introduction of zebra mussels.},

abstract={Population-level genetic diversity of the brown mussel Perna perna was investigated using nuclear microsatellite markers in 6 natural and 6 invasive populations. A total of 448 individuals from 12 populations spanning the natural and introduced ranges of the brown mussel were scored for 2 polymorphic microsatellite loci. Wright's hierarchical F statistics (F^sub ST^), Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, Nei's genetic distance, and other descriptive statistics were used to quantify geographic population subdivision, and to estimate the number of migrants per generation. F^sub ST^ values (0.007-0.042) revealed that genetic partitioning among populations was low. Microsatellite data revealed a slight difference in observed heterozygosity and no statistically significant differences in expected heterozygosity or allelic diversity between natural and introduced populations. Effective numbers of migrants (N^sub em^) per generation ranged from 6 to 35 individuals. The potential significance of an invasive species with high genetic variation in terms of the risk of establishment and conservation implications is discussed.},

title={LIGHT, GRAVITY AND CONSPECIFICS AS CUES TO SITE SELECTION AND ATTACHMENT BEHAVIOUR OF JUVENILE AND ADULT DREISSENA POLYMORPHA PALLAS, 1771},
abstract={Dreissena polymorpha, the zebra mussel, is one of the most important components of the aquatic ecosystems it inhabits, due to high densities and filtration rates of this fouling organism. This laboratory study deals with several physical and biological factors influencing zebra mussel juveniles (<10 mm) and adults (>10 mm) site selection behaviour and their byssal attachment to substrate. Mussels preferred black substrate rather than white. This preference was found to be stronger in smaller individuals. Furthermore, all mussels, independently of their size, selected shadowed sites and avoided illuminated ones. Large mussels attached more often in darkness than in light, while for small specimens light conditions made no difference. Large mussels tended to attach to lower parts of vertical test-tubes, while the numbers of small specimens in both halves of the test-tubes were similar. If initial conditions, used by mussels to select their attachment site, were changed by turning the test-tubes upside down, small individuals detached and looked for a new site more frequently than large ones. Large mussels attached more often in higher densities of conspecifics, but physical contacts among conspecifics and their size composition seemed to have no impact on attachment. This study shows that many environmental stimuli influence locomotion and attachment of post-metamorphic zebra mussels. Therefore, the behaviour of this group may impact upon adult distribution observed in field. Preferences exhibited by mussels lead to the creation of dense aggregations in dark, deep places, providing protection against dessication, predators and excessive water flow.},

abstract={The aquatic nuisance mussel, Limnoperna fortunei, arrived in Japan before 1987 possibly with the Asian clam imported as food from mainland China. Now the mussel's distribution has spread to two river systems in central Japan. Water authorities reported several cases of damage caused by L. fortunei. Most cases of damage were caused by dead mussels clogging small diameter pipes for raw water sampling and monitoring and for cooling water. Clogging of cooling water pipes stopped raw water pumping to a water purification plant and caused the shutdown of a turbine dynamo-electric generator in a hydraulic power plant. The attachment of L. fortunei caused the malfunction of a water level gauge. There was a heavy accumulation of dead L. fortunei in slurry treatment facilities and rotten mussels developed an offensive odour. Although the screens and pipes of the raw water intake and transmission were inhabited by L. fortunei, problems relating to their decreased hydraulic capacity were not reported. This may have been due to the low reproduction rate and short lifespan of L. fortunei. There was one reproduction period each year, during May to September and their lifespan was two years at most. The growth rate could be about 15<e2><80><89>mm yr<e2><88><92>1 in shell length. Although chlorine in either free or combined form is effective for the control of L. fortunei larvae, so far water supply authorities have not considered prechlorination in the intake, mainly because prechlorination deactivates the biological nitrification along the pipelines.},

title={Range expansion and potential dispersal mechanisms of the exotic cladoceran Daphnia lumholtzi},
abstract={. Recently the exotic cladoceran Daphnia lumholtzi has invaded freshwater systems throughout the southern and midwestern United States. We conducted regional surveys of eastern Kansas reservoirs to document the range expansion of D.lumholtzi. Daphnia lumholtzi was found in five of 35 reservoirs sampled in 1994, and 11 of the 35 reservoirs when re-sampled in 1997. In addition, we sampled 40 small ponds inaccessible to recreational boats, within the watershed of an invaded reservoir. We did not find D.lumholtzi in any of these ponds, suggesting that non-human dispersal mechanisms play an insignificant role in the range expansion of D.lumholtzi throughout the United States. Further experimentation, however, is needed to determine if the absence of D.lumholtzi from these small ponds is due to insufficient dispersal mechanisms or the inability of this invader to successfully colonize following arrival. Daphnia lumholtzi has broad limnological tolerances. However, invaded reservoirs tend to be larger in area, have higher Secchi disk depths, and lower total phosphorus, total nitrogen and chlorophyll a levels relative to non-invaded reservoirs. Analyses of pre-invasion zooplankton communities indicate that D.lumholtzi may be invading reservoirs in which native Daphnia species are rare. While the long-term effects of the invasion of D.lumholtzi are unknown, it has the potential to dominate late summer zooplankton communities in eastern Kansas reservoirs. Therefore, we need to continue to survey and monitor invaded reservoirs to document the range expansion of D.lumholtzi and determine the long-term implications of the introduction of this invader.},

abstract={1. We conducted survey and transplant studies to determine whether colonization and residency on soft sediments by introduced, fouling mussels (Dreissena polymorpha and D. bugensis) were affected by physical disturbance, and whether Dreissena presence in turn influenced the diversity and population densities of other benthic invertebrates. Surveys revealed that colony density was typically higher at moderate depths than at shallower and greater ones. However, the largest, midsummer colonies and greatest coverage of sediments by mussels occurred at deeper sites. 2. Disturbance of transplanted colonies varied by depth and colony size, with deeper and larger colonies experiencing the lowest destruction rates. Colony destruction rate was positively correlated with current velocity adjacent to the lakebed. 3. Absence of mussel colonies at shallow sites was not determined by recruitment or substrate limitation, as recruit density was higher and sediment characteristics more suitable for postveliger settlement at shallow than at deeper sites. Rather, seasonal storms have much stronger effects in shallow than in deep water. 4. Mussel residency on soft sediment has profound effects on invertebrate biodiversity. Invertebrate species (taxon) richness and total abundance were positively correlated with mussel colony area. Mussel-sediment habitat supported between 462 and 703\% more taxa, and between 202 and 335\% more individuals (exclusive of Dreissena) than adjacent soft-sediment lacking mussels. 5. Results from this study illustrate-that physical disturbance directly limits the distribution of mussels on soft sediments, and the diversity and abundance of other benthic invertebrates in consequence.},

title={Evaluation of Lake Michigan Sediment For Causes of the Disappearance of Diporeia spp. in Southern Lake Michigan},
abstract={The amphipod, Diporeia spp., the dominant benthic macroinvertebrate in the Great Lakes offshore waters, has exhibited a substantial decline in recent years. This decline occurred after the invasion and colonization of the lakes by the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha. It has been hypothesized that the decline is a direct result of the competition by the zebra mussel decreasing the amount of food available. This study examined the potential of other stressors, e.g., the presence of toxic materials, as the contributing or main cause of the decline. Bioassays were performed with sediments from stations currently devoid of Diporeia (St. Joseph, MI) and with those still having Diporeia populations. In 28-d mortality bioassays, no mortality was observed with any of the sediments tested. However, in avoidance/preference tests, sediments from St. Joseph, that are now devoid of Diporeia, were avoided compared to sediments from Saugatuck, Grand Haven, and Muskegon, which still have a population. This avoidance was not changed by the addition of either Spirulina Plus super( registered ) or Tetramin super( registered ) flakes to the sediment as a food source but was reversed by a fresh layer of the diatom, Fragillaria crotonensis, on the sediment. These studies suggest that despite the high carbon content of the St. Joseph sediment, the nutritional content of the sediment was limited.},

abstract={The effect of varying algal availability on byssal thread production by re-attaching zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) was quantified. The byssal apparatus was severed and mussels allowed to re-attach to a hard substratum for a 21 day period during which they were fed at algal concentrations of 0.0, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0 or 2.0 mg C l<-1<. Byssal thread production was quantified by counting the number of new attachment plaques present each day. Results showed that starved mussels continued to partition organic carbon towards thread production but the resultant byssal mass was compromised, containing fewer threads than those produced by fed mussels. The daily average byssal thread production by mussels fed at 2.0 mg C l<-1< was greater than that of starved mussels and the final mean dry soft tissue weight higher. At algal C concentrations below maintenance requirements byssal thread production was elevated compared to starved mussels, but there was no concurrent increase in soft tissue. This suggests that below maintenance levels assimilated carbon was solely partitioned towards byssus production and stored reserves may have been utilized. The ratio of organic carbon contained in the byssus to that in the soft tissues remained relatively constant across all feeding levels. This suggests that the carbon content of the byssus is a constant function of that of the soft tissue mass. These results may explain seasonal variation in attachment strength of numerous byssate species and seasonal vertical migrations by D. polymorpha.},

abstract={We sought to characterize patterns in growth of young-of-the-year (YOY) yellow perch (Perca flavescens Mitchill) based on large-scale ecosystem changes that have been occurring in Lake Erie during the past 20 years. Using trawl indices collected during this time period, we contrast the pattern of growth in YOY yellow perch from distinct basins of Lake Erie spanning a natural gradient of trophic state. Large scale ecosystem changes associated with phosphorus (P) abatement and the invasion by Dreissenid mussels occurred in the western basin prior to the initiation of the time series, but were delayed until recently in the eastern basin. Although inter-annual variation in growth was considerable, the lack of synchrony between basins suggests temperature or P levels was not exclusively limiting yellow perch growth. Bioenergetic analyses suggest YOY yellow perch growth may be additionally constrained by energy availability, with the largest effects evident in the less productive eastern basin. Our analyses quantify the relative impacts of climatic, community and ecosystem level effects on the growth of yellow perch as Lake Erie continues to respond to change. Elucidating biotic and abiotic processes that shape system production and energy available for growth in widespread species like yellow perch will provide greater heuristic power when managing complex and dynamic ecosystems.},

abstract={We hypothesize that the introduction of the round goby in Lake Erie will result in a decline of crayfish densities, proposing two mechanisms: 1) direct predation of young-of-year (YOY) crayfish by round gobies and 2) indirectly via exclusion of adult crayfish from refugia by gobies resulting in increased risk of predation from other predators. In a laboratory experiment testing for the first mechanism, we allowed two size classes of gobies (80-100 mm and 120-140 mm) to prey on three sizes of YOY crayfish for 72 h in the presence of alternative prey (zebra mussels and associated macroinvertebrates). YOY crayfish were indeed selected as prey by gobies, although crayfish mortality in the small goby treatment declined from 65% to 13% as crayfish increased in size (4.9 mm to 12.7 mm mean carapace length). The refugia elimination hypothesis also was tested in the laboratory using pools with a limited number of refuges relative to densities of gobies and crayfish using a smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieui) predator. Gobies clearly evicted adult crayfish from refugia increasing crayfish exposure to smallmouth bass. By continuing to expand its range and abundance, the round goby likely will have strong negative effects on crayfish populations throughout Lake Erie.},

title={Reproduction of river and lake populations of Hyridella depressa (Unionacea: Hyriidae) in New South Wales: implications for their conservation},
abstract={The freshwater mussel Hyridella depressa is an important component of the macrobiota of freshwater systems of south-eastern Australia. This species has declined in river habitats but is abundant in impounded water storages. Reproduction of river and lake populations of H. depressa was investigated to document details of their gametogenic cycle and to determine when the females incubate embryos in their gill marsupia. Four populations in Lake Burragorang and two populations in the Hawkesbury-Nepean River were studied over two breeding seasons. Reproduction was documented by anatomical and histological examination of the gonads. The study sites differed in anthropogenic influence and trophic status and the influence of these factors on reproduction in H. depressa was assessed. A skewed sex ratio in favour of females was common in the populations and histology revealed that some of these females were microhermaphrodites. It appears that sexuality in H. depressa is labile with the potential for self-fertilisation by individuals that largely function as females. H. depressa is a long-term brooder with progeny present in the marsupia for up to eight months of the year from mid-winter to late summer. Across all sites brooding started in July or August and finished in January or February of the following year. In parallel with the prolonged spawning pattern, gametogenesis in H. depressa was continuous. At the eutrophic sites the gonads contained advanced gametes throughout the year. H. depressa at these sites had a high annual reproductive output with the females producing several clutches each year. In contrast, gametogenesis in mussels at the oligotrophic sites was more seasonal. At one of the oligotrophic sites reproductive failure was common and in 1996 most females failed to brood a single clutch. Implications of this research for conservation of H. depressa are discussed.},

abstract={The zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha was introduced to North America during the mid-1980s, and is now a dominant member of many benthic communities in the lower Great Lakes. In this study, I explored the abundance, biomass, size structure and settlement of Dreissena inhabiting rocks along a wave-swept disturbance gradient near Middle Sister Island in western Lake Erie. Ten rocks were collected from quadrats at six sites along each of three transect lines oriented perpendicular to shore. Occurrence, abundance and biomass of Dreissena on smaller, movable rocks were positively associated with rock distance from shore ( similar to lake depth) and with rock area; rocks at nearshore sites supported little, if any, Dreissena, whereas those at offshore sites were heavily colonized. Mussel size distributions also differed in relation to shore distance. Large mussels ( greater than or equal to 19 mm) were underrepresented or absent on rocks collected at nearshore sites, but were overrepresented at offshore locations ( greater than or equal to 37 m). Settlement of larval mussels on settling pads was positively correlated with distance offshore and with time of exposure, though settlement was substantial even at a nearshore (10 m) location. Area-adjusted mussel dry mass increased more rapidly with distance offshore on large than on small rocks. Large rocks also required more force to displace and were significantly less likely to be disturbed when transplanted at the study site. Results from this study indicate that occurrence, abundance and size structure of Dreissena in nearshore waters of Lake Erie correspond with the frequency of habitat disturbance, though other factors including food limitation and larval supply may also contribute to these patterns. These patterns complement studies that established the significance of physical disturbance in other aquatic systems.},

This statement of intent, the fish-community objectives for Lake Huron, represents a result of this process for the Lake Huron Committee. Fish-community objectives for Lake Huron rest on a set of ecological principles, tempered by social values, that give direction to management action and express management intent. The objectives reflect the understanding that natural systems are dynamic and provide some latitude in adjusting management approaches to different conditions that might arise.},

The system is based on a computer assessment of valve movements in two groups of up to 42 zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha). Every 5 minutes, the percentage of open mussels and the average number of valve movements per mussel are calculated to describe the activity behaviour of the mussels. Rapid changes in both parameters normally reflect the onset of stress. More than 5Â½ years of experience in the continuous monitoring of water quality have revealed (1) that the â€œDreissena-Monitorâ€ is suited to large rivers like the Rhine as well as small rivers like the Erft or Ruhr, (2) that a lack of technical interruptions guarantees reliable, unattended operation, (3) that normally less than 3 hours of weekly maintenance are required, (4) that the validity check of the primary measurements was capable of identifying dead mussels and poorly aligned measurement components, (5) that the system can operate under unfavourable conditions (e.g. temperatures below 5Â° C), (6) that mortality rates were low and correlated positively with temperature, and (7) that the alarm thresholds provided a high degree of statistical security.},

abstract={A workshop entitled What's Next? The Prediction and Management of Exotic Species in the Great Lakes was held in October 1991 to examine issues pertaining to exotic species and to recommend prevention and control strategies for future unplanned introductions into the Great Lakes. As long as the Great Lakes are inoculated with exotic species, new species will become established regardless of the state or condition of the ecosystem. As legislative and regulatory policies are designed to prevent new unplanned introductions, they must consider vector management and broaden in scope to include the North American continent. The workshop recommends that: 1) ballast water controls extend from the Great Lakes to the North American continent and include provisions to monitor both compliance to and effectiveness of the regulations; 2) a public education program be developed in the Great Lakes basin to alert the public of the dangers associated with releasing exotic species into non-native waters; 3) studies begin immediately to determine the extent of actual or potential release of exotic species associated with the aquaculture, bait fish, and pet industries and advisories should be issued against the use of organisms not present in the Great Lakes by these industries; 4) a Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Information Network (NASIN) be established to act as a clearing-house for information and coordinator of research and management within North America and a liaison with the regions that serve as the sources for North American introduced species.},

The locus coding for the glycolytic enzyme phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) is the most variable, with 7 alleles present in the Dreissena population at the study site in western Lake Erie. A series of experiments was performed during the summers of 1990 and 1991 to determine if metabolic rate was genotype-dependent at ambient and elevated temperature in Dreissena . Increasing water temperature has been hypothesized as a factor limiting southern expansion of Dreissena in North America. Results provide evidence that Dreissena possesses considerable genetic variation, and that variation at PGI can respond to selection via elevated temperature. This implies that zebra mussels have the ability to adapt to local temperature regimes, and that thermal tolerance measured on "northern" populations may not accurately predict ultimate thermal tolerances of "southern" populations of Dreissena .},

Feeding experiments were conducted on widely distributed bivalve species in the lagoon, including eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica), hooked mussels (Ischadium recurvum), charru mussels (Mytella charruana), green mussels (Perna viridis), Atlantic rangia (Rangia cuneata), and hard clams (Mercenaria mercenaria), which were exposed to 3<e2><80><89><c3><97><e2><80><89>104 cells<c2><a0>mL<e2><88><92>1 of five species of microalgae consisting of A. lagunensis and the three species clarified herein, the picocyanobacteria Crocosphaera sp. and <e2><80><98>Synechococcus<e2><80><99> sp., and the picochlorophyte Picochlorum sp., as well as Nannochloropsis oculata used as a control. To ensure clearance rates were indicative of consumption and assimilation, the microalgae were isotopically (15N) labeled prior to feeding experiments.

Copper water quality criteria in marine waters is often determined with bivalve embryo-larval toxicity tests which measure survival and normal development as endpoints. Gene expression data is increasingly incorporated into such assays as a complementary and sensitive marker of contaminant exposure or toxicity. Here we measured the impacts of copper on Mytilus californianus larval transcriptional profiles, and identified sensitive biomarkers of copper exposure. Key functional categories that were identified among these genes include biomineralization/shell formation, metal binding, and development. Finally, we compared the transcriptional response of larvae to that of adult gill tissue, and show in both datasets that patterns of declining transcript expression occur at lower copper concentrations than those required to induce increases in transcript expression, suggesting that down-regulated genes serve as the most sensitive marker of copper exposure.},

As such, it is considered as a promising <e2><80><98>blue growth<e2><80><99> potential and promoted within the European Union. To expand mussel aquaculture, new regions have to be considered because there are multiple marine usages, and spatial limitations occur in coastal areas. The brackish Baltic Sea might be considered for expansion of mussel aquaculture. This study focusses on estimated production potential, economic profitability and nutrient remediation potential of mussel farming at different salinities. Four experimental mussel farms were set up along the German Baltic coast at salinities ranging from 7 to 17 psu. Collected growth data was used to calibrate and validate a Dynamic Energy Budget model and to predict the potential mussel production at twelve sites along the German coast. The estimated production and nutrient removal was used to assess economic profitability, assuming two usages of the harvest: human consumption and mussel meal production. Measured mussel specific growth rates increased with salinity from 0.05 mm d-1 in Greifswald Bay to 0.11 mm d-1 in Kiel Fjord. Within 6 months, a one-hectare farm could produce from 1 t (Darss-Zingst-Bodden-Chain) to 51 t (Flensburg) fresh mussels and remove 1.1 to 27.7 kg P and 24.7 to 612.7 kg N, respectively.

abstract={We evaluated how eutrophication and humification impacted nutrient cycles and the efficiency of carbon transfer in the planktonic food webs of 12 lakes in north-eastern Poland that differed in trophic state. Our results indicated that the effectiveness of carbon transfer between phytoplankton and zooplankton varied from 0.0005% to 0.14%, which is much lower than the theoretical 10%. The highest efficiency of carbon transfer occurred in the mesotrophic lakes due to the higher hypolimnetic zooplankton production, while the lowest efficiency was observed in the dystrophic lakes and in one eutrophic lake that was dominated by cyanobacteria. Inedible algae (e.g. Gonyostomum semen) and cyanobacteria appeared to be the main factors reducing the efficiency of the transfer of matter in pelagic food webs. The results of our study showed that plankton communities are a key component of the nutrient cycle in freshwater food webs. Phytoplankton were a very effective nitrogen sink, and in the mesotrophic lakes, up to 99% of the total nitrogen was sequestrated in phytoplankton. As a result, there was a depletion of inorganic nitrogen in the upper water layer. Furthermore, zooplankton were an important phosphorus sink, thus significantly influencing the nutrient cycles.},

abstract={Researchers worldwide are studying the environmental distribution and impacts of manufactured or environmentally fragmented small pieces of plastics, so called microplastics (<5 mm). These microplastics eventually build up in the marine environment, threatening marine ecosystems. The magnitude, fate and effects of these microplastics across the food web are largely unknown. Here, we measured digested microplastics in a top predator and critically endangered species, the North-East Atlantic Porbeagle shark (Lamna nasus), and compared this with general health conditions. A method for quantifying microplastics in spiral valves of porbeagle sharks was developed. Microplastics were detected in all spiral valves, up to 10.4 particles per g wet weight (w.w.) content and 9.5 particles per g w.w. tissue. This equates to individual microplastics loads as high as 3850 particles per spiral valve, most likely a result of trophic transfer. No statistically significant correlations were found between the average number of plastic particles in spiral valve content and tissue and the Condition and Hepatosomatic Index of porbeagle sharks. The results of this research show that North-East Atlantic porbeagle sharks ingest and digest microplastics and that there is a potential for microplastic biomonitoring using this species. More research is needed to detect possible health effects of microplastic contamination in these apex predators.},

Here, we highlight how improved approaches could rapidly advance mechanistic understanding. We find that, to the best of our knowledge, no study has yet collected the data required to test this hypothesis well, and 71% of studies fail to define a baseline. Experiments that clearly link timing to fitness and test extremes, integration across approaches and null models would aid robust predictions of shifts with climate change.Phenological shifts due to climate change can desynchronize the timings of life history events between species, but predicting the consequences is challenging.

A statistical regionalization was performed with monthly level KDI using k-means clustering to subdivide the Great Lakes into regions with similar temporal variability in water clarity. The KDI was then used to assess the relationship between water clarity and atmospheric circulation patterns and stream discharge. An artificial neural-network-based self-organized map data reduction technique was used to classify atmospheric patterns using four atmospheric variables: mean sea level pressure, 500-hPa geopotential heights, zonal and meridional components of the wind at 10 m, and 850-hPa temperature. Stream discharge was found to have the strongest relationship with KDI, suggesting that sediments and dissolved matter from land runoffs are the key factors linking the atmosphere to water clarity in the Great Lakes. Although generally lower in magnitude than stream discharge, atmospheric circulation patterns associated with increased precipitation tended to have stronger positive correlations with KDI. With no long-range forecasts of stream discharge, the strong relationship between atmospheric circulation patterns and stream discharge may provide an avenue to more accurately model water clarity on a subseasonal-to-seasonal time scale.},

Nutrient-laden influx from agricultural practices accounted for the increase in nitrate, phosphate and the relatively low silicate. Hypoxic conditions during the two bloom episodes reflected the vulnerability of this lagoon ecosystem. The cyanobacterial blooms were dominated by potentially toxic species; Anabaena circinalis, A. flos-aquae, A. limnetica and A. spiroides. A comparison of ambient nutrient ratios with the Redfield ratio (N/P/Si<e2><80><89>=<e2><80><89>16:1:16) showed clear temporal variations that coincided with phytoplankton dynamics and the bloom regime. Low N/P ratios were recorded during the first 8<c2><a0>months, and there was a shift to higher ratios during the subsequent 8<c2><a0>months, followed by low N/P ratios in the last 2<c2><a0>months. Higher silicate values coincided with decreased cyanobacterial biomass, cyanobacteria bloom collapse and proliferation of diatoms during the first annual cycle. Cyanobacterial abundance exceeded the alert level 1 and almost reached alert level 2 which call for continuous environmental monitoring and management of coastal waters.},

title={Molluscan genomics: the road so far and the way forward},
abstract={Mollusca is the second most species-rich phylum within the metazoans, displaying critical economic, ecological and scientific importance. Yet, they are still largely underrepresented with respect to genomic resources. The emergence of next-generation sequencing technologies has revolutionized deep-scale genomic characterization of non-model organisms, and molluscs are slowly entering this transformative era. Here, we provide a historical contextualization of the Genome Revolution in molluscs with a tour de force revision of key research trends observed over the past decade. Omic approaches such as RAD-seq, transcriptome, mitogenome and whole-genome sequencing represent the most significant resources produced for this phylum. Importantly, the molecular mechanisms underscoring multiple biological novelties and adaptations observed in molluscs are starting to be unravelled. In contrast, compared to other metazoan lineages the genomic resources currently available for this lineage still lag far behind. We put forward that to fully grasp the evolutionary and adaptive roads of this tantalizing group of organisms crucially depends on the full embracement of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies in the near future.},

title={Moving Toward an Agenda on Ocean Health and Human Health in Europe},
abstract={The integrated study of ocean health and human health is an emerging area of increasing global importance. Growing evidences demonstrate that the health of the ocean and the health of humans have always been and will continue to be, inextricably linked. Our actions towards the oceans will significantly influence the future of the whole planet and, in turn, our own health. The current review of these issues arose from a summer school in San Sebastian (Spain), from 5th-7th June, 2019. An interdisciplinary group of researchers discussed key risks (e.g. microbial pollution, pharmaceuticals, harmful algal blooms, plastic pollution) and benefits (e.g. bathing waters, recreation, tourism) of the seas and global ocean for humanity; and debated the future priorities and potential actions for a joint Oceans and Human Health research and governance programme in Europe. The aim of this review is to contribute to the emerging scientific agenda on ocean health and human health, as well as coordinate efforts with stakeholders, policy makers and the general public. This agenda operates within the larger context of the upcoming United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development: 2021-2030, which strives to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), including healthy (human) lives and well-being (SDG3) and conserving and sustainably using the oceans (SDG14), among others. In addition to summarising some of the key risks and benefits, therefore, we describe the governance of oceans and health interactions (especially in Europe), and we finish by proposing a list of elements for potential future research priorities on oceans and human health.},

title={Experimental evidence for the adaptive response of aquatic invertebrates to chronic predation risk},
abstract={As acute stress induced by predation risk can generate significant oxidative damage, prey organisms are forced to balance their defence reaction and the cost of activating the cellular defence system. Stress tolerance differs significantly among species; therefore predator pressure indirectly shapes the community structure. To test adaptation abilities of amphipod crustaceans (Dikerogammarus villosus and Gammarus jazdzewskii) we exposed them to acute (35<c2><a0>min.) and chronic (1 or 7<c2><a0>days) predation risk (the Eurasian perch). We measured respiration (related to metabolic rate), cellular defence systems (antioxidant enzyme (catalase) activity and heat shock protein (Hsp70) concentration), and the level of oxidative damage (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) concentration). Both amphipods increased their respiration rate in the presence of predation cues, irrespective of the duration of their pre-exposure to danger. This increase in D. villosus was initiated more quickly (immediately vs. after 10<c2><a0>min. of the test) and lasted for a longer time (20 vs. 10<c2><a0>min.) than in G. jazdzewskii. However, only G. jazdzewskii after a short exposure to predation risk exhibited an increase in its catalase activity, Hsp70 concentration and oxidative damage. No changes in these parameters were exhibited by D. villosus or after a chronic exposure of G. jazdzewskii to predation cues. Our results show that prey organisms are able to reconfigure their physiology to maintain increased metabolic rate under prolonged predator pressure and, at the same time, reduce oxidative damage as well as costs related to anti-oxidant defence.},

title={Removal of Heavy Metals in Contaminated Soil by Phytoremediation Mechanism: a Review},
abstract={The rapid development of industrial sector has increased the heavy metal pollution issue recently, as the need of various metals is increasing for manufacturing purpose. These metals are the natural components that can be found in soil, but contamination happens when the concentration of these metals are high in soil due to anthropogenic activities. Several remediation techniques such as physical method, thermal desorption, chemical, and electrokinetic remediation are used to remediate the soil contaminated by heavy metals recently. As these remediation technologies have limitation on cost, effectiveness, and environmental friendly remediation issue, phytoremediation is then attracting the attention from various researchers due to its advantages of efficient, cost-effective, and eco-friendly remediation method. The mechanisms of phytoremediation are phytoextraction, phytostabilization, phytovolatilization, phytodegradation, phytodesalination, rhizofiltration, rhizodegradation, and phytoevaporation. However, these mechanisms were affected by several factors such as the plant species, properties of medium, bioavailability of metal, and the addition of chelating agent. The type of plant utilized for phytoremediation (metallophytes) is categorized as metal indicators, metal excluders, and metal hyperaccumulators. This review article comprehensively discusses the source and effect of heavy metal on human health as well as phytoremediation techniques and mechanism during the heavy metal removal.},

Macroinvertebrate cadavers were exposed to three suspended sediment concentrations (control 3.5, low 83.7 and high 404.0<c2><a0>mg<c2><a0>l<e2><88><92>1) at two velocities (low 0.19<c2><a0>m<c2><a0>s<e2><88><92>1 and high 0.37<c2><a0>m<c2><a0>s<e2><88><92>1), for 6<c2><a0>h in a recirculating flume. Tracheal gill surfaces were subsequently examined for evidence of physical damage using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. Physical damage predominantly consisted of fine sediment coverage of gill surfaces, appearing as a deposited layer of sediment obscuring and potentially clogging the gill. For E. venosus, suspended sediment concentration influenced gill cover, but velocity had no significant effect. Coverage of H. siltalai gill surfaces increased significantly between low and high sediment concentrations but only at the higher flow velocity. Gill coverage of E. danica did not differ across any sediment concentration. The results were consistent with reported species sensitivities to fine sediment, despite the use of cadavers. However, we found limited evidence of physical abrasion as a direct physical effect of fine sediment under the experimental conditions used.},

abstract={This study aimed to assess the effects of major ecotoxic heavy metals accumulated in the Buriganga and Turag River systems on the liver, kidney, intestine, and muscle of common edible fish species Puntius ticto, Heteropneustes fossilis, and Channa punctatus and determine the associated health risks. K was the predominant and reported as a major element. A large concentration of Zn was detected in diverse organs of the three edible fishes compared with other metals. Overall, trace metal analysis indicated that all organs (especially the liver and kidney) were under extreme threat because the maximum permissible limit set by different international health organizations was exceeded. The target hazard quotient and target cancer risk due to the trace metal content were the largest for P. ticto. Thus, excessive intake of P. ticto from the rivers Buriganga and Turag could result in chronic risks associated with long-term exposure to contaminants. Histopathological investigations revealed the first detectable indicators of infection and findings of long-term injury in cells, tissues, and organs. Histopathological changes in various tissue structures of fish functioned as key pointers of connection to pollutants, and definite infections and lesion types were established based on biotic pointers of toxic/carcinogenic effects. The analysis of histopathological alterations is a controlling integrative device used to assess pollutants in the environment.},

abstract={In this article, we describe the use of diagnostic timescales as simple tools for illuminating how aquatic ecosystems work, with a focus on coastal systems such as estuaries, lagoons, tidal rivers, reefs, deltas, gulfs, and continental shelves. Intending this as a tutorial as well as a review, we discuss relevant fundamental concepts (e.g., Lagrangian and Eulerian perspectives and methods, parcels, particles, and tracers), and describe many of the most commonly used diagnostic timescales and definitions. Citing field-based, model-based, and simple algebraic methods, we describe how physical timescales (e.g., residence time, flushing time, age, transit time) and biogeochemical timescales (e.g., for growth, decay, uptake, turnover, or consumption) are estimated and implemented (sometimes together) to illuminate coupled physical-biogeochemical systems. Multiple application examples are then provided to demonstrate how timescales have proven useful in simplifying, understanding, and modeling complex coastal aquatic systems. We discuss timescales from the perspective of â€œholismâ€, the degree of process richness incorporated into them, and the value of clarity in defining timescales used and in describing how they were estimated. Our objective is to provide context, new applications and methodological ideas and, for those new to timescale methods, a starting place for implementing them in their own work.},

abstract={As the primary energy and carbon source in aquatic food webs, phytoplankton generally display spatial heterogeneity due to complicated biotic and abiotic controls; however our understanding of the causes of this spatial heterogeneity is challenging, as it involves multiple regulatory mechanisms. We applied a combination of field observation, numerical modeling, and remote sensing to display and interpret the spatial gradient of phytoplankton biomass in a Dutch tidal bay (the Eastern Scheldt) on the east coast of the North Sea. The 19<c2><a0>years (1995<e2><80><93>2013) of monitoring data reveal a seaward increasing trend in chlorophyll-a (chl<c2><a0>a) concentrations during the spring bloom. Using a calibrated and validated three-dimensional hydrodynamic<e2><80><93>biogeochemical model, two idealized model scenarios were run: switching off the suspension feeders and halving the open-boundary nutrient and phytoplankton loading. Results reveal that bivalve grazing exerts a dominant control on phytoplankton in the bay and that the tidal import mainly influences algal biomass near the mouth. Satellite data captured a post-bloom snapshot that indicated the temporally variable phytoplankton distribution. Based on a literature review, we found five common spatial phytoplankton patterns in global estuarine<e2><80><93>coastal ecosystems for comparison with the Eastern Scheldt case: seaward increasing, seaward decreasing, concave with a chlorophyll maximum, weak spatial gradients, and irregular patterns. We highlight the temporal variability of these spatial patterns and the importance of anthropogenic and environmental influences.},

The means of Jout and Jnet were much more variable than those for Jin, but several species by target SO42<e2><88><92> concentration combinations for Jout and Jnet, were negative, which suggests the net excretion of SO42<e2><88><92> by the animals.

title={Zooplankton Community Responses to Oxygen Stress},
abstract={Recent changes in climate and eutrophication have caused increases in oxygen depletion in both freshwater and marine ecosystems. However, the impact of oxygen stress on zooplankton, which is the major trophic link between primary producers and fish, remains largely unknown in lakes. Therefore, we studied 41 lakes with different trophic and oxygen conditions to assess the role of oxygen stress on zooplankton communities and carbon transfer between phytoplankton and zooplankton. Samples were collected from each lake at the peak of summer stratification from three depth layers (the epilimnion, metalimnion, and hypolimnion). Our results revealed that freshwater zooplankton were relatively tolerant to anoxic conditions and the greatest changes in community structure were found in lakes with the highest oxygen deficits. This caused a switch in dominance from large to small species and reduced the zooplankton biomass in lower, anoxic layers of water, but not in the upper layers of water where the oxygen deficits began. This upper anoxic layer could thus be a very important refuge for zooplankton to avoid predation during the day. However, the reduction of zooplankton in the lower water layers was the main factor that reduced the effectiveness of carbon transfer between the phytoplankton and zooplankton.},

Absolute daily growth rates were compared among control and treatment group mussels. Growth rates were positive for ><e2><80><89>98% of mussels and no mortality occurred.

In concert, summertime biological production is projected to shift earlier and become larger. These changes have potentially important consequences for stakeholders with interests in shipping, coastal habitability, fishing, water quality, and recreation.

title={Changes in benthic community composition associated with the outbreak of the corallimorph, <i>Rhodactis howesii</i>, at Palmyra Atoll},
abstract={Few studies have documented the spatial and temporal dynamics of highly invasive species in coral reef benthic communities. Here, we quantified the ecological dynamics of invasion by a corallimorph, Rhodactis howesii, at Palmyra Atoll in the central Pacific. A localized outbreak of this species was first observed following a shipwreck at Palmyra in 1991 and has subsequently spread across hectares, reaching 100% cover in some areas. We examined the spatial and temporal dynamics of this invasion, and its impact on the benthic community, using a combination of permanent photoquadrats and large-scale photomosaic imagery. Our data revealed two distinct patterns in the spatial dynamics of R. howesii on the reef. First, following the removal of the shipwreck in 2013, the cover of the corallimorph in the immediate vicinity of the wreck decreased markedly, with crustose coralline algae (CCA), an important reef-builder, dominating the newly available substrate. However, in contrast to the decline at the epicenter of the invasion, the corallimorph has spread to additional sites around the atoll where increases in abundance have been associated with decreases in hard coral cover. Reductions in percent cover and corallimorph patch size near the epicenter of the outbreak, coupled with increases in cover and patch size and appearance of the corallimorph at other locations around Palmyra, demonstrate the dynamic nature of this â€œinvasion.â€ Further, we found that the corallimorph settled disproportionately often on patches of turf or CCA cover, but can then overgrow all benthic competitors following establishment. This study provides evidence that R. howesii has the capacity to be highly invasive on coral reefs and highlights the importance of large-scale, long-term monitoring efforts to capture the dynamic nature of such invasions.},

abstract={Contamination status of coastal areas of Finland (northern Baltic Sea) markedly affected by anthropogenic activities (harbours, shipyards and maritime activity, industry, municipal and agricultural inputs, legacy contamination) was assessed for the first time using the weight of evidence (WOE) approach. The key element of the study was the caging (transplantation) of Baltic mussels (Mytilus trossulus) for the measurement of tissue accumulation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and applying a suite of biomarkers of biological effects of contaminants. Additional variables included in the assessment were trace metals in seawater, macrozoobenthos, near-bottom oxygen levels and eutrophication indicators. The chemical parameters were supported by passive sampling of PAHs and organotins at the study sites. The integrated approach combining all the line of evidence (LOE) variables into the WOE showed separation of some sites as more affected by hazardous substances than others, with the most contaminated areas found around harbour and ship yard areas. The contaminant levels measured in the different matrices were not alarmingly high at none of the areas compared to many other areas within or outside the Baltic Sea under more heavy anthropogenic impact, rarely exceeding any given threshold values for Good Environmental Status of the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive. However, significant biological effects were recorded in mussels in the most contaminated sites, signifying that the combined effects caused by the contaminants and other environmental factors are disturbing the health of marine organisms in the area. The results of this successful combined application based on the mussel transplantation method and the WOE approach are highly encouraging for further trials in developing the monitoring of chemical contamination in the Baltic Sea.},

While modeling efforts have been able to describe expanded potential of these services, only a single commercial pilot scale, real-world demonstration, has been documented. Over two production seasons (2017-2018), the optimization of nutrient extractive potential of mussels (Mytilus edulis) at full commercial-scale was evaluated by first testing multiple density configurations of conventional longline-spat collector setups and potential harvest times, then by comparing different cultivation technologies at three farms. Potential biomass volumes of 770-1700 t with longlines and 2100-2600 t on nets was demonstrated in full-scale production (18.8 ha), yielding 0.6-1.27 t N ha-1 and 0.04-0.1 t P ha-1, and 1.63-2.0 t N ha-1 and 0.1-0.12 t P ha-1 respectively. In general, 1 t of harvested mitigation mussels will yield 13.7 kg N and 0.9 kg P. Winter harvests exhibited higher yields (103-124%) than early spring harvests on optimized configurations, favoring an abbreviated production season. Production potential was similar between sites, despite differing environmental conditions, indicating eutrophic waters are suitable for expanded mitigation production.

Pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) observed in tissues of snails collected during summer were greater than those measured in snails collected during winter. Catalase activities observed during autumn were greater than those observed during other seasons. Activities of catalase were greater at all sites near sources of contamination than in snails from the reference site (S6). Lactate dehydrogenase activity was also greater at all sites relative to the location designated as the reference (S6), at which activities did not exceed 8.10 U/L. Patterns of genomic DNA in snails, as determined by use of OPA-02 primer, were significantly different among sites. Location S1 (Belshay village) exhibited 11 bands, followed by S2 (El-Demer zone) and S5 (Rosetta branch) which exhibited 6 bands. In contrast, all sites exhibited greater numbers of bands when the OPA-08 primer was used. Thus, DNA fingerprinting, lactate dehydrogenase, and catalase offer useful biomarkers in ecotoxicology and risk assessment programs.},

abstract={The Pine River downstream of the Velsicol Superfund site has been contaminated with various hydrophobic organic pollutants for more than 50 years. Remediation and sediment dredging near the site began in spring of 1999, and was completed in 2006. In 2011, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality completed a baseline assessment report long-term monitoring plan for the Pine River. However, there has been limited assessment of the benthic community since this evaluation. The objective of this research was to evaluate the risk of Pine River sediment to aquatic macroinvertebrates downstream from the Superfund site after decades of degradation and dredging using the Triad approach. Three sites were selected downstream from the Superfund site, and an upstream reference site was used. At each site, macroinvertebrates surveys were conducted and sediments were collected for chemical analysis of DDT (1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis (4-chlorophenyl) ethane) and its degradation products and for laboratory toxicity testing for mortality and sublethal effects using Hyalella azteca and Chironomus dilutus. Sediment concentrations of DDT, DDD, and DDE were below levels expected to cause toxicity, and there was no observed toxicity in laboratory tests. Additionally, there were no statistically significant differences in richness, richness of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) species, total EPT abundance, percent EPT, or percent dominant taxa between the reference site and the downstream sites. There was an observed decrease in abundance of macroinvertebrate taxa at all downstream sites and a shift in macroinvertebrate structure when comparing the reference with most impaired sites. Although the sites downstream of the Superfund site remain different than the upstream control, there are improvements in species composition and abundance. However, more research is needed to evaluate the potential effects on ecosystem function.},

abstract={In aquatic ecosystems, natural processes that remove nitrogen from the biologically available pool (e.g. denitrification) have been intensively studied as an ecosystem function that reduces eutrophication. The quantity of sediment organic matter is a key driver of denitrification with percent organic content positively related to rates of nitrogen removal; however, few studies have investigated the influence of the quality of organic matter on nitrogen cycling in estuarine sediments despite shifts in primary producers with eutrophication. This laboratory study using intact benthic communities investigates the influence of various organic detritus sources, which vary in their C:N ratio, on nitrogen gas (N2) and solute fluxes and extracellular enzyme activity in estuarine sediments. A custom-built tank with a removable front plate was used with a planar optode film to image sediment oxygenation. Mangrove leaf detritus significantly increased the net N2 production in sediments, while the deposition of other detrital sources and control sediments produced net N2 consumption. Sulfatase activity was significantly reduced in the mangrove leaves and seagrass treatments, suggesting alteration of heterotrophic microbial activity with reducing oxygen conditions. Leucine aminopeptidase activity, indicating nitrogen cycling, was reduced in all treatments, suggesting the organic detritus provided a nitrogen supplement or reduced the activity of extracellular enzymes producing microbes. Bivalve biomass increased net nitrogen gas fluxes in some treatments. Our results indicate different detrital sources may have varying impacts on the removal of bioavailable nitrogen through denitrification and show that feedbacks in biogeochemical cycles may occur with changes in organic detrital source pools.},

title={Biochemical responses of freshwater mussel <i>Unio tumidus</i> to titanium oxide nanoparticles, Bisphenol A, and their combination},
abstract={Multiple interactions between different pollutants in the surface waters can cause unpredictable consequences. The aim of the study was to evaluate the combined effect of two widespread xenobiotics, titanium oxide nanoparticles (TiO2) and bisphenol A (BPA), on freshwater bivalve Unio tumidus. The specimens were exposed for 14 days to TiCl4 (Ti, 1.25<e2><80><89><c2><b5>M), TiO2 (1.25<e2><80><89><ce><bc>M), BPA (0.88<e2><80><89>nM), or their combination (TiO2<e2><80><89>+<e2><80><89>BPA). Every type of exposure resulted in a particular oxidative stress response: TiO2 had antioxidant effect, decreasing the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and phenoloxidase (PhO) activity, and doubling reduced glutathione (GSH) concentration in the digestive gland; Ti caused oxidative changes by increasing levels of ROS, PhO and superoxide dismutase; BPA decreased the GSH level by a factor of two. In the co-exposure treatment, these indices as well as lysosomal membrane stability were not affected. All Ti-containing exposures caused elevated levels of metalated metallothionein (Zn,Cu-MT), its ratio to total metallothionein protein, and lactate/pyruvate ratio. Both BPA-containing exposures decreased caspase-3 activity. All exposures, and particularly co-exposure, up-regulated CYP450-dependent oxidation, lipid peroxidation and lipofuscin accumulation, lysosomal cathepsin D and its efflux, as well as alkali-labile phosphates in gonads and caused DNA instability (except for TiO2). To summarize, co-exposure to TiO2<e2><80><89>+<e2><80><89>BPA produced an overlap of certain individual responses but strengthened the damage. Development of water purification technologies using TiO2 requires further studies of the biological effects of its mixtures. U. tumidus can serve as a sentinel organism in such studies.},

title={Short-term toxicity effects of <i>Prymnesium parvum</i> on zooplankton community composition},
abstract={Harmful algal blooms (HABs) can disrupt aquatic communities through a variety of mechanisms, especially through toxin production. Herbivorous and omnivorous zooplankton may be particularly susceptible to HAB toxins, due to their close trophic relationship to algae as grazers. In this study, the acute toxigenic effects of the haptophyte Prymnesium parvum on a zooplankton community were investigated under laboratory conditions. Total zooplankton abundances decreased during 48-h exposure, although species responses to P. parvum densities varied. Changes in community composition were driven by declines in Daphnia mendotae and Keratella spp. abundances, which resulted in an average shift in copepod abundance from 47.1 to 72.4%, and rotifer abundance from 35.0 to 7.1%. Total cladocerans were relatively unchanged in relative abundance (11.1<e2><80><93>10.4%), though the dominant cladoceran shifted from Daphnia mendotae (61.3% of cladocerans) to Bosmina longirostris (81.5% of cladocerans). Daphnia mendotae and Keratella spp. are known to be non-selective or generalist feeders and were likely harmed through a combination of ingestion of and contact by P. parvum. Proportional increases in copepod and Bosmina abundances in the presence of P. parvum likely reflect selective or discriminate feeding abilities in these taxa. This study corroborates previous field studies showing that P. parvum can negatively affect zooplankton, reflecting species-specific differences in zooplankton-P. parvum interactions. Such changes can alter zooplankton community composition, leading to substantial food-web consequences and potential long-term ecosystem-level impacts in lakes that experience blooms.},

title={The systems approach framework for collaborative, science-based management of complex systems},
abstract={Sustainable management of coastal systems can only be achieved with an effective science-policy interface that integrates the three pillars of sustainable development: environmental protection, social progress and economic growth. The Systems Approach Framework (SAF) provides a structure to guide such a process by embracing the challenge of assessing complex systems for scenario simulations to support potential policy decisions. Based on applications of the SAF in six Baltic Sea case studies within the BONUS BaltCoast project, the SAF was revisited and further developed. Two additional steps were introduced partly to enhance implementation and decision validation and partly to facilitate the reiterative process with the addition of monitoring and evaluation. The SAF now includes six steps (Issue Identification, System Design, System Formulation, System Assessment, Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation). A list of actions for each step clearly defines what needs to be done before progressing to the next SAF step. Activities within each step were improved to better integrate governance - citizen collaboration and improve the science-policy interface. Three auxiliary tools, developed in the BONUS BaltCoast project to support particular actions, were integrated in the different steps to facilitate application of the SAF by practitioners and scientists alike. The added focus on the stakeholder participation resulted in further actions being listed in the new steps to maintain stakeholder engagement and counteract stakeholder fatigue. The revised SAF is presented and discussed together with lessons learned from the different applications in five Baltic Sea study sites.},

title={Gonadal Histopathological Disorders in Mytilus galloprovincialis Male Exposed to Tars Used in Mussel Farms},
abstract={Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and trace metals are pollutants widely distributed in the marine environment with toxic effects on live organisms, but few laboratory studies have proved their causal relationship with histopathologic alterations from invertebrates. We analyse the histopathologic effects of a tar mixture used in mussel farms on the gonad of male mussels. Mussels were exposed to water-accommodated fractions from different sub-lethal concentrations of that tar mixture during different times. The accumulation of PAHs and metals in mussels was quantified in each one tar exposure condition, and a comparative histological and morphometric analysis of the male gonad was performed, as well as of the gametogenic disorders and the cellular pathologies induced. Spermatogenesis disruption and alterations of somatic and germinal cells were observed as a direct effect of treatment. The pathologies observed followed an increasing malignity sequence depending on dose and exposure time: spawning induction; arrest of spermatogenesis and spermiogenesis; suppression of immune response; dysplasia of Sertoli and connective cells and finally, severe disorders of germinal cells. We demonstrate for the first time that tar used in waterproofing of floating rafts from the mussel farms causes severe effects on male mussel gonad, constituting a direct risk to the health of these organisms, affecting gametogenesis, quality of gametes and, ultimately, the sustainability of this resource and their quality for human consumption. Moreover, we propose the pathologies described in mussel as biomarkers of marine pollution and the mussel gonad as study model of testicular toxicity mechanisms in male reproduction.},

title={Transcriptomic Analysis of the Onchidium reevesii Central Nervous System in Response to Cadmium},
abstract={Shellfish are widely used in coastal environments for biomonitoring of heavy metal pollution. Research on the sea slug Onchidium reevesii, an economically important benthic gastropod, is limited due to a lack of genomic resources. This study, based on Illumina sequencing, compared the transcriptomes of O. reevesii before and after cadmium exposure, and used time-series expression analysis. The molecular level stress response mechanism operating in this organism in environmental stress conditions was investigated. De novo assembly of the O. reevesii transcriptome yielded 51,007 unigenes, of which 14,774 were annotated. Time-series expression analyses resulted in clustering of most responsive transcripts into 16 statistically significant expression profiles. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis based on time-series expression identified metal ion binding, synaptic transmission, and oxidative stress as important biological processes, and expression analysis identified genes related to invertebrate responses to environmental stress. Furthermore, we have generated the first transcriptome of O. reevesii, and the extensive sequence data produced will provide valuable molecular resources for study of the response of O. reevesii to cadmium exposure.},

title={The lampenflora in show caves and its treatment: an emerging ecological problem},
abstract={The artificial lighting of caves adapted for touristic visits, leads to the appearance and propagation of a complex community of phototrophic organisms known as "lampenflora". Formed mainly by algae and cyanobacteria, they produce the degradation of the colonized substrates and decrease the show value of the caves. This phenomenon became famous worldwide in the 1960s due to the damage caused to the paintings in the Lascaux Cave (France). Since then it has become an issue of serious concern to both managers of show caves and to the international scientific community. Over time, the problem has been approached following two complementary strategies: preventing colonization by the invading organisms or eliminating them once they have become established through the use of chemical products, mainly biocides and strong oxidants. This kind of treatment generates pollutant effluents that can move the problem from the walls of the caves to the groundwater. This paper presents a critical literature review of the problem and the proposed solutions, and emphasizes the need for further study of the optimal doses of treatment chemicals and to develop quantitative methods to determine their effectiveness.},

abstract={Research on Lake Pend Oreille, Idaho, has focused on the influence of two potential limiting factors for kokanee Oncorhynchus nerka (Walbaum, 1792): competition for food with Mysis diluviana (Loven, 1862, hereafter Mysis) and predation by lake trout Salvelinus namaycush (Walbaum, 1792). Population fluctuations of Mysis and lake trout have resulted in substantial heterogeneity in food web conditions, apparently altering both bottom-up and top-down dynamics. Therefore, relative importance of predation and competition were evaluated as drivers of kokanee abundance, biomass, and production. A series of general linear models was used to evaluate relative influences of Mysis and lake trout on kokanee. Kokanee production was a density-dependent process and the collapse of Mysis corresponded to an increase in the modeled maximum annual production of kokanee from 224 tonnes to 408 tonnes. Lake trout also negatively influenced kokanee biomass. A Mysis-mediated, predator-induced kokanee biomass collapse occurred when lake trout and Mysis abundances were both high. Sustainable management of this fishery requires recognition that competition with Mysis will define the scope of kokanee production and therefore the scope of sustainable predation.},

title={Alternative host identity and lake morphometry drive trematode transmission in brook charr},
abstract={Both biotic and abiotic factors have been invoked to explain the large variations observed in the prevalence and abundance of parasites in aquatic ecosystems. However, we have only a poor knowledge of the potential interplay among these factors in natural systems. It is, therefore, important to analyze the effects of multiple potential environmental drivers together to get an integrated view of their influence on the prevalence and abundance of parasites. To this end, we selected two genera of digenean trematode parasites that require at least two hosts to complete their life cycle and use two different transmission strategies. Crepidostomum moves through a trophic pathway via consumption of infected prey by the host, while Apophallus infects its hosts via direct penetration of their skin. This study was conducted in 23 Canadian Shield lakes exhibiting orthogonal gradients of biotic (fish species richness and biomass) and abiotic (morphometry, physico-chemical) variables. We quantified prevalence and abundance of these parasites in the skin and intestine of brook charr (Salvelinus fontinalis). Our results show that biotic factors are key drivers of parasite abundance and prevalence, with Apophallus being negatively associated with the fish species richness<e2><80><93>biomass gradient, and Crepidostomum responding more to identity of host than to the diversity gradient. Among the abiotic variables, lake area<c2><a0>was found to be positively related to both prevalence and abundance in Apophallus. Our results suggest that taking into account the interplay of both biotic and abiotic factors is crucial for understanding patterns of parasite transmission success in boreal lakes.},

title={Combining biomarker and community approaches using benthic macroinvertebrates can improve the assessment of the ecological status of rivers},
abstract={Indices based on community structure provide a global ecological status of the biological communities but they are of limited value as early-warning indicators of contamination. Almost two decades after the Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) was adopted, we reviewed publications that measured biomarkers in benthic macroinvertebrates in biomonitoring programmes of fluvial systems. The focus was on studies that attempted to incorporate both biomarkers and community-based approaches in the evaluation of the ecological status of rivers and streams. Overall, the data showed that biomarker measurements in benthic macroinvertebrate species can offer complementary information on the factors threatening these communities. This information is particularly useful for water authorities, in order to take actions before a system collapses into a state from which recovery is difficult or impossible. Gaps in need to be addressed for rapid and efficient implementation of biomarkers in benthic macroinvertebrates in routine wide-scale monitoring are discussed. In particular, site-specific baselines have to be defined, taking into account the influence of biotic and abiotic factors on these biochemical responses. Further studies, including different biomarkers, environmental stressors, macroinvertebrate taxa and river types, will provide crucial information on how to establish adequate biomarker strategies to indicate future ecological damage.},

abstract={Shallow lowland lakes are critical components of the water cycle, providing an essential service function. However, the impacts of microcystin from phytoplankton communities on benthic macroinvertebrate community diversity and structure have seldom been investigated. During 2008-2012, the impacts of water environmental variables on the diversity of macrobenthic communities, including water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, transparency, conductivity, the permanganate index, Chlorophyll a, total phosphorus, total nitrogen, and microcystin-LR (L for leucine and R for arginine), were measured in a typical shallow lowland lake, Ge Lake. The results of the present study demonstrated that there were 31 benthic macroinvertebrate taxa in Ge Lake, including 7 oligochaetes, 7 Mollusca, 14 chironomids, and 3 other taxa. Among the macrobenthic taxa in the benthic community, opportunistic taxa such as Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri are present and can occur at greater densities in disturbed habitats. However, a significant reduction/disappearance of sensitive and clean taxa was observed among the benthic macroinvertebrates. Water temperature, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, ammonia nitrogen, transparency and total phosphorus were the main environmental variables influencing macrobenthic community structure, while water temperature, conductivity, ammonia nitrogen, Chlorophyll a, the permanganate index, total phosphorus and total nitrogen were the main factors that influenced macrobenthic community diversity indices (the numbers of taxa, Shannon's diversity index, Margalef's richness index, and Pielou's evenness index). Our results underscore the severity of the effects of human activity on Ge Lake and strongly suggest that restoring the benthic invertebrate community to previous conditions would require the control and reduction of environmental pollutants and nutrients in Ge Lake.},

abstract={Seagrass beds are vulnerable to eutrophication (nutrient loading) and declining worldwide. To quantify the fate of nitrogen (N) inputs, intact sediment cores were incubated in a continuous-flow system with 15N enrichments to compare N consumption and efflux pathways within and near seagrass (Thalassia testudinum) beds in St. Joseph Bay, Florida. Sediment oxygen demand and total ammonium (NH4+) efflux were greater (p<e2><80><89><<e2><80><89>0.001) in vegetated versus unvegetated sediments, suggesting that seagrasses enhance organic matter remineralization. Denitrification rates were 2<e2><80><93>20<c3><97> greater than estimates of potential dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA). The effect of vegetation on denitrification rates was inconsistent. Direct denitrification of overlying water nitrate and N fixation rates were low, suggesting tight coupling between remineralization, nitrification, and denitrification. DNRA rates were lower than denitrification and consistently greater in vegetated sediments. DNRA rate measurements are conservative if sediment cation exchange decreases the fraction of 15NH4+ reaching overlying water, especially in vegetated sediments, where rates of nitrate-induced ammonium fluxes were observed. Coupled nitrification-denitrification was the major N loss pathway in this system, as evidenced by the lack of 15N-labeled N2 production in isotope-enriched cores. Using measured sediment oxygen demand and NH4+ fluxes as an indicator of organic matter quality and quantity, these results are consistent with previous work showing that labile organic matter helps regulate the balance between N removal and internal recycling pathways in seagrass systems, which has implications for coastal management strategies to address eutrophication.},

title={Comparison of some epigean and troglobiotic animals regarding their metabolism intensity. Examination of a classical assertion},
abstract={This study determines oxygen consumption (R), electron transport system (ETS) activity and R/ETS ratio in two pairs of epigean and hypogean crustacean species or subspecies. To date, metabolic characteristics among the phylogenetic distant epigean and hypogean species (i.e., species of different genera) or the epigean and hypogean populations of the same species have been studied due to little opportunity to compare closely related epigean and hypogean species. To fill this gap, we studied the epigean Niphargus zagrebensis and its troglobiotic relative Niphargus stygius, and the epigean subspecies Asellus aquaticus carniolicus in comparison to the troglobiotic subspecies Asellus aquaticus cavernicolus. We tested the previous findings of different metabolic rates obtained on less-appropriate pairs of species and provide additional information on thermal characteristics of metabolic enzymes in both species or subspecies types. Measurements were done at four temperatures. The values of studied traits, i.e., oxygen consumption, ETS activity, and ratio R/ETS, did not differ significantly between species or subspecies of the same genus from epigean and hypogean habitats, but they responded differently to temperature changes. Higher Q10-values for oxygen consumption of N. stygius than N. zagrebensis in the temperature range 10-20C and higher Ea indicated higher thermal sensitivity in the subterranean species. On the other hand, lower Q10 and Ea-values for ETS activity of N. stygius than N. zagrebensis indicated more thermally stable enzymatic machinery in N. stygius than N. zagrebensis. In Asellus, we observed a similar trend of lower Ea for oxygen consumption and higher Ea for ETS activity in epigean than the troglomorphic subspecies, but the values did not differ significantly between the two. Our most important conclusion is that the low metabolic rate is not a universal property of troglobiotic animals, and the degree of metabolic adaptation is not necessarily in agreement with the degree of morphological adaptation (troglomorphy).},

abstract={PurposeThe construction of riparian buffer strips has become increasingly important due to the effective phosphorus (P) retention of the strips, thus preventing eutrophication in freshwater ecosystems. The key mechanism is P sorption in soils. To provide some suggestions for increasing the sorption ability of P, the relationships between P sorption behavior and both land use patterns and distance from the shoreline were determined.Materials and methodsIn April, July, and October 2013, field investigations were carried out along the shoreline of Lake Chaohu. Eleven sections, including 36 sampling sites at different distances from the shoreline, were chosen, and these sections contained different types of riparian buffer strips, such as grassland, farmland, forest, wetland, and forest/grassland. The P species, sorption parameters, and dominant vegetation species were analyzed.Results and discussionThe total P (TP) and P sorption maximum (Qmax) showed no recognizable seasonal variation and were closely correlated with the distance from the shoreline. The further the distance from the shoreline, the higher the TP and Qmax values, suggesting that soil traits could determine the P sorption extent. However, the Olsen-P content and equilibrium P concentration (EPC0) fluctuated greatly, with the peak occurring in spring and the minimum occurring in summer in the majority of the sampling sites. In addition, positive relationships existed between the TP content and the Qmax value as well as the Olsen-P content and the EPC0 value. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) further showed that the Olsen-P content and EPC0 values were closely related to the dominant vegetation species, indicating that land use patterns played a decisive role in regulating the P sorption strength and the level of available P.ConclusionsTo effectively adsorb P (increase Qmax) and prevent P leaching (reduce the EPC0), we recommend changing the land use patterns (more constructed wetlands and forests with grass) in riparian buffers.},

title={Bioreactivity and Microbiome of Biodeposits from Filter-Feeding Bivalves},
abstract={Bivalves serve an important ecosystem function in delivering organic matter from pelagic to benthic zones and are important in mediating eutrophication. However, the fate of this organic matter (i.e., biodeposits) is an important consideration when assessing the ecological roles of these organisms in coastal ecosystems. In addition to environmental conditions, the processing of biodeposits is dependent on its composition and the metabolic capacity of the associated microbial community. The objectives of this study were to compare the biological reactivity, potential denitrification rates, and microbial communities of biodeposits sourced from different bivalve species: hard clam (Mercenaria mercenaria), eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica), and ribbed mussel (Geukensia demissa). To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate and compare the microbiome of bivalve biodeposits using high-throughput sequencing and provide important insight into the mechanisms by which bivalves may alter sediment microbial communities and benthic biogeochemical cycles. We show that clam biodeposits had significantly higher bioreactivity compared to mussel and oyster biodeposits, as reflected in higher dissolved inorganic carbon and ammonium production rates in controlled incubations. Potential denitrification rates were also significantly higher for clam biodeposits compared to oyster and mussel biodeposits. The microbial communities associated with the biodeposits were significantly different across bivalve species, with significantly greater abundances of Alteromonadales, Chitinophagales, Rhodobacterales, and Thiotrichales associated with the clam biodeposits. These bioreactivity and microbial differences across bivalve species are likely due to differences in bivalve physiology and feeding behavior and should be considered when evaluating the effects of bivalves on water quality and ecosystem function.},

title={Managing Eutrophication in the Szczecin (Oder) Lagoon-Development, Present State and Future Perspectives},
abstract={High riverine nutrient loads caused poor water quality, low water transparency and an unsatisfactory ecological status in the Szczecin (Oder) Lagoon, a trans-boundary water at the southern shore of the Baltic Sea. Total annual riverine N (P) loads into the lagoon raised at the 20th century from approx. 14,000~t~TN (1,000~t~TP) to 115,000~t~TN (10,500~t~TP) in the 1980ties and declined to about 56,750~t~TN (2,800~t~TP) after 2010. Nutrient concentrations, water transparency (Secchi depth) and chlorophyll-a showed a positive response to the reduced nutrient loads in the Polish eastern lagoon. This was not the case in the German western lagoon, where summer Secchi depth is 0.6 m and mean chlorophyll-a concentration is four times above the threshold for the Good Ecological Status. Measures to improve the water quality focused until now purely on nutrient load reductions, but the nutrient load targets and Maximal Allowable Inputs are contradicting between EU Water Framework Directive and EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive. According to the HELCOM Baltic Sea Action Plan, the thresholds of the annual riverine nutrient inputs to the lagoon would be about 48,850~t~N (1,570~t~P). Actions in the river basins that would allow meeting these targets are hardly achievable. Even if the load targets would be fully implemented, they are not sufficient to transfer the lagoon into a non-eutrophic state. The implementation of EU Water Framework Directive is further hampered, as consistent water quality thresholds for the two parts of Szczecin Lagoon are missing. An approach to harmonize them is presented, which incorporates the spatial differences. By implementing consistent water quality targets, Szczecin Lagoon could serve as blueprint for other trans-boundary waters. In the western lagoon, nutrient load reductions in the past decades had no effect on the water quality. High water residence times, frequent sediment resuspension and the missing submerged vegetation inhibit the load reduction effects on the water quality. Internal measures in the western lagoon are necessary, which aim at removing nutrients and$\/$ or increasing water transparency to overcome the hysteresis effect and to initiate a recovery of macrophytes. The most promising approach seems the cultivation of zebra mussels.},

title={Do native white-clawed crayfish impact macroinvertebrate assemblages in Mediterranean limestone headwaters?},
abstract={Crayfish are among the largest aquatic macroinvertebrates in rivers and streams. Their trophic ecology is important for the understanding of the functioning of benthic communities. This is relevant in key areas, such as headwaters, as they partly condition the processes occurring downstream. To shed light on the effects of native white-clawed crayfish, Austropotamobius pallipes, on local macroinvertebrate assemblages from running headwaters, a three-month mesocosm-based field study was designed. Collection and subsequent analysis of benthic samples under different crayfish density levels yielded a set of metrics indicative of short-term impacts at general and taxonomic scales. Neither significant positive nor negative effects on the community were evident in terms of richness, diversity, dominance and biomass. A combination of highly patched distributions of macroinvertebrates along with a weak impact of crayfish foraging activity is considered to explain this lack of effects. Only temporal changes associated with particular biological cycles appeared for some of the main taxa. Based on the results, we are not able to determine whether the white-clawed crayfish perceptibly disturbs the structure and composition of the local macroinvertebrate assemblages in the short-term. Thus, its use in future restocking projects is supported.Alternate abstract: Les <c3><a9>crevisses sont parmi les plus gros macroinvert<c3><a9>br<c3><a9>s aquatiques dans les rivi<c3><a8>res et les ruisseaux.

title={Diets and Trophic Structure of Fish Assemblages in a Large and Unexplored Subtropical River: The Uruguay River},
abstract={The Neotropics represent a hotspot for freshwater biodiversity with vast number of fish species of scarce ecological knowledge. This holds true for the Uruguay River, where fish assemblages and their diets remain unexplored. Fish assemblages were surveyed in 14 sites along the river main course, from headwaters to mouth (approximately 1800 km), with the aim to identify the trophic roles of fishes and to describe trophic structure of these assemblages, following standardized sampling campaigns and laboratory procedures. One hundred species (2309 gut contents) were analysed and classified into four trophic groups subdivided into eight lower-level groups: Piscivore, piscivore-invertivore, detritivore, omnivore-detritivore, omnivore-invertivore, omnivore-planktivore and omnivore-herbivore. The trophic structure of the assemblages varied along the river, with the relative species richness of fish consuming terrestrial invertebrates increasing towards the middle river section, probably driven by the large floodplains in that areas, supporting global theories such as the flood pulse concept. This study describes the feeding habits of fish along the Uruguay River, being the first dietary description for 29 species. This knowledge is essential for management and conservation, serving as baseline in the context of future environmental changes while generating novel evidence on the functioning of ecosystems in this scarcely studied climatic region.},

title={Phosphorus Availability and Growth of Benthic Primary Producers in Littoral Lake Sediments: Are Differences Linked to Induced Bank Filtration?},
abstract={Submerged macrophytes and periphyton are benthic primary producers that play an important role for several ecosystem functions of lakes. Their growth often depends on the availability of phosphorus (P) in sediments and overlying water. This P availability is assumed to potentially be affected by induced bank filtration (IBF), a cost-effective method for drinking water production. In this study, we tested whether littoral sediments sampled at sites with high and low influence of IBF in a temperate eutrophic lake used for bank filtration since more than 100 years affects periphyton and macrophyte growth. Sediments differed in aerobic desorbed water-soluble phosphorus (PH2O) and iron (Fe) content and the growth of macrophytes in sediments with a high impact of IBF was lower compared to sediments with low impact of IBF. We also found that P addition to the nutrient solution increased periphyton growth and that periphyton limited macrophyte growth. While these results point to a potential impact of IBF on P availability in sediments that can cascade to benthic primary producers, we could not prove mechanistic links between high rates of IBF and the lower macrophyte growth. Additional research to assure a sustainable application of this valuable drinking water production method is therefore needed.},

abstract={Since its introduction from North America in the 1970s, the American razor clam Ensis leei (M. Huber, 2015) has successfully spread throughout North Sea coasts from Spain to Norway and the United Kingdom to the western Baltic. We investigated the distribution and abundance of this non-indigenous bivalve species as a potential novel food resource for common scoter Melanitta nigra (Linnaeus, 1758) along the eastern German North Sea coast. Highest densities of flightless moulting and wintering common scoters coincided with areas of high E. leei abundance. Other European studies showed common scoters extensively feed on E. leei. Even with these findings, it remains difficult to demonstrate convincingly that E. leei constitutes a major food source for common scoter in the German North Sea during their non-breeding season. However, our study suggests that E. leei has become an important prey item for internationally important concentrations of common scoters at large spatial scales.},

title={Outbreak of avian botulism and its effect on waterbirds in the Wilderness Lakes, South Africa},
abstract={Avian botulism has been reported in many areas worldwide, particularly in North America, where at times it has resulted in die-offs of hundreds of thousands of waterbirds. By contrast, there are few reported cases in wild waterbird communities in South Africa. Mass die-offs of waterbirds in the Wilderness Lakes, South Africa, were first observed in January 2015, raising concerns about the effect of disease on the status of waterbird communities in this Ramsar site. Surveys of bird carcasses were undertaken between 2015 and 2017. An estimated 1115 individuals from 23 species were affected, with sick individuals displaying symptoms of avian type C, C and D or E botulism. The highest mortality was amongst red-knobbed coot ( Fulica cristata ), Cape shoveler ( Anas smithii ) and yellow-billed duck ( Anas undulata ), respectively comprising 60%, 18% and 9% of affected individuals. Cape shoveler was found to be particularly susceptible to the disease. Deaths occurred mainly during summer and autumn (November<e2><80><93>April). No mortalities were recorded amongst 44 waterbird species, of which common moorhen ( Gallinula choropus ), African purple swamphen ( Porphyrio madagascariensis ) and reed cormorant ( Phalacrocorax africanus ) are widespread and abundant. The reasons for the outbreaks remain elusive, as environmental changes characteristic of a botulism outbreak, notably a decline in water level and dissolved oxygen, did not differ substantially from earlier years when no disease outbreaks were observed. The role of fish, and in particular the recently introduced common carp ( Cyprinus carpio ) in the progression of the disease, remains speculative, although worthy of investigation. The removal of carcasses for disease control should be continued. Conservation implications: The long-term effect of repeated outbreaks of avian botulism on the abundance of susceptible waterbird species in the Wilderness Lakes is of concern. The previous regular high abundance of duck species, particularly yellow-billed duck and Cape shoveler, was the initial reason for the Wilderness Lakes being declared a Ramsar site. The effect of ongoing high disease-related mortalities may, in part, prevent these wetlands from continuing to regularly support globally significant populations of some waterbird species. The containment of the disease must be attempted by the regular collection and removal of dead birds and fish during the outbreak periods of November<e2><80><93>June, and carcasses should be disposed of off-site. Further testing of affected individuals should be undertaken and the monitoring of environmental variables and affected individuals continued to improve the understanding of the drivers and progression of the disease.},

title={A conservation palaeobiological approach to assess faunal response of threatened biota under natural and anthropogenic environmental change},
abstract={Palaeoecological records are required to test ecological hypotheses necessary for conservation strategies as short-term observations can insufficiently capture natural variability and identify drivers of biotic change. Here, we demonstrate the importance of an integrated conservation palaeobiology approach when making validated decisions for conservation and mitigating action. Our model system is the Razimâ€“Sinoie lake complexÂ (RSL) in the Danube Delta (Black Sea coast, Romania), a dynamic coastal lake system hosting unique Pontocaspian mollusc species that are now severely under threat. The Pontocaspians refer to an endemic species group that evolved in the Black Sea and Caspian Sea basins under reduced salinity settings over the past few million years. The natural, pre-industrial RSL contained a salinity gradient from fresh to mesohaline (18 ppm) until human intervention reduced the inflow of mesohaline Black Sea water into the lake system. We reconstruct the evolution of the RSL over the past 2000Â years from integrated sedimentary facies and faunal analyses based on 11 age-dated sediment cores and investigate the response of mollusc species and communities to those past environmental changes. Three species associations (â€œmarineâ€, â€œPontocaspianâ€ and â€œfreshwaterâ€) exist and their spatio-temporal shifts through the system are documented. Variable salinity gradients developed, with marine settings (and faunas) dominating in the southern part of the system and freshwater conditions (and faunas) in the northern and western parts. Pontocaspian species have mostly occurred in the centre of the RSL within the marineâ€“freshwater salinity gradient. Today, freshwater species dominate the entire system, and only a single Pontocaspian species (Monodacna colorata) is found alive. We show that the human-induced reduced marine influence in the system has been a major driver of the decline of the endemic Pontocaspian biota. It urges improved conservation action by re-establishing a salinity gradient in the lake system to preserve these unique species.},

title={Miocene syn-rift lacustrine sediments in the Mecsek Mts. (SW Hungary)},
abstract={The Pannonian Basin, a major back-arc basin in the Alpineâ€“Carpathian orogenic belt, experienced its syn-rift phase during the Earlyâ€“Middle Miocene. Studying coeval sediments can provide important information on the initiation of the extension. This paper investigates syn-rift deposits in the Mecsek Mts. in SW Hungary from a tectono-sedimentary aspect, using stratigraphy, palaeontology and structural observations to constrain palaeoenvironments and their tectonic background. Our study shows that in the Mecsek area the widespread Early Miocene fluvial sedimentation was not directly followed by inundation by the Central Paratethys sea, instead, a phase of lacustrine deposition in the Karpatianâ€“Early Badenian (late Burdigalianâ€“early Langhian) preceded the marine flooding. The lake sediments have a low-diversity but abundant, endemic mollusc and ostracod fauna, dominated by the bivalve Congeria boeckhi and the gastropod Ferebithynia vadÃ¡szi. Identical faunas at various sites indicate that â€œLake Mecsekâ€ was a single water body, covering the present-day Mecsek Mts. and their surroundings. Wedge-shaped clastic bodies along faults, fault scarp breccias and semi-soft sediment deformations suggest that extensional tectonic activity related to the rifting of the Pannonian Basin played a role in lake basin formation. The accumulation of lakes was probably also enhanced by increased precipitation during the Miocene Climatic Optimum. The Central Paratethys flooded the area in the Badenian (Langhian) and deposited normal marine sediments over the lacustrine ones. Considering the fauna, the sedimentary succession, the structural background and evolution history, the Mecsek area seems to be part of the Illyrian bioprovince and related to the Dinaride Lake System.},

abstract={This study investigates the potential of bioturbating Tubificidae to alter biogeochemical processes by sediment aeration in order to enhance ecosystem development in eco-engineering projects. We introduced Tubificidae in three different densities (5000, 15,000, and 30,000 individuals m<e2><88><92>2) in clay-rich sediment from lake Markermeer (The Netherlands). Redox potential, nutrients and major elements were measured from the water column and porewater at different depths. Mineral phase and redox transfers were chemically modelled and oxygen concentrations in bioturbated sediments for each density were mathematically predicted. The measured results of this experiment showed that Tubificidae oxygenated the upper 15<c2><a0>mm of the sediment. This resulted in decomposition of sedimentary organic matter with an associated sixfold increase in NH4 and NOx concentrations in the porewater and the water column. However, phosphorus concentrations were declining in the upper 16<c2><a0>mm, likely as a result of immobilization by pyrite oxidation and production of iron oxides. These bioturbation effects were highest in the treatment with an intermediate density of Tubificidae (15,000 worms m<e2><88><92>2) as aeration effects in the treatment with the highest density of Tubificidae (30,000 worms m<e2><88><92>2) was impeded by high respiration rates. Furthermore, with a two dimensional diffusion model, simulated effects of respiration and aeration on the oxygen concentration in the sediment suggest that the bioturbation effect is strongest at a density of 12,000 worms m<e2><88><92>2. In ecological engineering projects where fast ecosystem development is important, introducing Tubificidae to aquatic sediments to optimal densities might enhance initial ecosystem development due to improved availability of nitrogen as nutrient.},

title={Spatial Subsidies and Mortality of an Estuarine Copepod Revealed Using a Box Model},
abstract={Mortality of planktonic populations is difficult to determine because assumptions of the methods are rarely met, more so in estuaries where tidal exchange ensures violation of the assumption of a closed or spatially uniform population. Estuarine plankton populations undergo losses through movement from productive regions, creating a corresponding subsidy to regions that are less productive. We estimated mortality rates of the copepod Pseudodiaptomus forbesi in the San Francisco Estuary using a vertical-life-table approach with a Bayesian estimation method, combined with estimates of spatial subsidies and losses using a spatial box model with salinity-based boundaries. Data came from a long-term monitoring program and from three sample sets for 1991<e2><80><93>2007 and 2010<e2><80><93>2012. A hydrodynamic model coupled with a particle-tracking model supplied exchange rates between boxes and from each box to several sinks. In situ mortality, i.e., mortality corrected for movement, was highly variable. In situ mortality of adults was high (means by box and sampling program 0.1<e2><80><93>0.9<c2><a0>day<e2><88><92>1) and appeared invariant with salinity or year. In situ mortality of nauplii and copepodites increased from fresh (~<e2><80><89>0) to brackish water (means 0.4<e2><80><93>0.8<c2><a0>day<e2><88><92>1), probably because of consumption by clams and predatory copepods in brackish water. High mortality in the low-salinity box was offset by a subsidy which increased after 1993, indicating an increase in mortality. Our results emphasize the importance of mortality and spatial subsidies in structuring populations. Mortality estimates of estuarine plankton are feasible with sufficient sampling to overcome high variability, provided adjustments are made to account for movement.},

abstract={Thiamine deficiency complex (TDC) is a disorder resulting from the inability to acquire or retain thiamine (vitamin B1) and has been documented in organisms in aquatic ecosystems ranging from the Baltic Sea to the Laurentian Great Lakes. The biological mechanisms leading to TDC emergence may vary among systems, but in fishes, one common outcome is high mortality among early life stages. Here, we review the causes and consequences of thiamine deficiency in fishes and identify potential solutions. First, we examine the biochemical and physiological roles of thiamine in vertebrates and find that thiamine deficiency consistently results in impaired neurological function across diverse taxa. Next, we review natural producers of thiamine, which include bacteria, fungi, and plants, and suggest that thiamine is not currently limiting for most animal species inhabiting natural aquatic environments. A survey of historic occurrences of thiamine deficiency identifies consumption of a thiamine-degrading enzyme, thiaminase, as the primary explanation for low levels of thiamine in individuals and subsequent onset of TDC. Lastly, we review conservation and management strategies for TDC mitigation ranging from evolutionary rescue to managing for a diverse forage base. As recent evidence suggests occurrences of thiamine deficiency may be increasing in frequency, increased awareness and a better mechanistic understanding of the underlying causes associated with thiamine deficiency may help prevent further population declines.},

abstract={Eutrophic systems are stressful for zooplankton species, especially for small organisms (<<e2><80><89>1000<c2><a0><ce><bc>m) that are inefficient in consuming large colonies or filaments of cyanobacteria. Certain mechanisms, however, enable organisms to coexist in spite of the stress related to poor food quality or manageability of the diet. The present work suggests that coprophagy is recurrent behavior in cladocerans that may facilitate the survival and growth of some species in eutrophic systems. We chose three clones of Moina macrocopa that inhabit eutrophic systems. The species selected as possible facilitators were the cladocerans Simocephalus vetulus and Daphnia similis, and the ostracod Heterocypris incongruens, because they are cosmopolitan, have high rates of cyanobacterial filtration and in some cases coexist with Moina. The design used for the demographic experiments of the three clones of M. macrocopa was based on the source of nutrition and consisted of a control diet of Scenedesmus acutus (1<e2><80><89><c3><97><e2><80><89>106 cells<c2><a0>ml), a diet of undigested cyanobacteria (10<e2><80><89><c3><97><e2><80><89>106 cells<c2><a0>ml), and this same diet after digestion by D. similis, S. vetulus or H. incongruens. The excreta of the cladocerans was a deficient diet for Moina, whose populations decreased by more than 1 individual per day. On the contrary, fecal pellets of the ostracod were a diet that allowed Moina to have positive population growth (0.3<c2><a0>day<e2><88><92>1). Our results help to explain the high densities achieved by cladocerans in eutrophic tropical water bodies where cyanobacterial blooms are normal.},

abstract={Recruitment patterns of sessile species often do not reflect the composition of the local propagule pool. This is, among other processes, attributed to the stimulation or inhibition of settlement by resident species. In an experimental study, we evaluated the effects of different densities of the ascidian Diplosoma listerianum on the settlement of the hydrozoan Obelia sp. For this, we monitored the cover of the dominant fouler Obelia sp. on vertically orientated PVC tiles, which were either bare or pre-seeded with two different densities (sparse or dense) of Diplosoma colonies, over the course of 8<c2><a0>weeks. The settlement tiles were deployed at two study sites in La Herradura Bay, Chile. The presence of D. listerianum enhanced the settlement or the growth or both of the colonial hydrozoan, but this effect disappeared within 4<e2><80><93>8<c2><a0>weeks. Furthermore, we tested whether the initial enhancement of Obelia sp. by Diplosoma colonies goes back to the fact that larvae, which reject the ascidian tunic as a settlement substratum after a first contact, colonize nearby surfaces because of their limited mobility. However, we found no support for this assumption. We rather suggest that D. listerianum facilitated colonization indirectly by the accumulation of organic material in its vicinity and/or by its pumping activity. Initial resident-mediated enhancement of the hydrozoan was overridden by processes such as competition between later colonizers within the course of weeks and we could not detect any lasting effects of D. listerianum on the structure of the developing communities.},

abstract={The Curonian Lagoon is Europe<e2><80><99>s largest lagoon and one of the most seriously impacted by harmful blooms of cyanobacteria. Intensive studies over the past 20 years have allowed us to identify the major drivers determining the composition and spatial extent of hyperblooms in this system. We summarize and discuss the main outcomes of these studies and provide an updated, conceptual scheme of the multiple interactions between climatic and hydrologic factors, and their influence on internal and external processes that promote cyanobacterial blooms. Retrospective analysis of remote sensed images demonstrated the variability of blooms in terms of timing, extension and intensity, suggesting that they occur only under specific circumstances. Monthly analysis of nutrient loads and stoichiometry from the principal tributary (Nemunas River) revealed large interannual differences in the delivery of key elements, but summer months were always characterized by a strong N (and Si) limitation, that depresses diatoms and favors the dominance of cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria blooms result in transient (night-time) hypoxia, which stimulates the release of iron-bound P, producing a positive feedback for blooms of N-fixing cyanobacteria. Other biotic factors, such as dreissenid mussels, chironomid larvae, cyprinids and large bird colonies, may also promote P recycling during summer, but their role as drivers of cyanobacteria blooms is understudied.},

abstract={Recently, the use of Daphnia magna has been proposed in on-line and real-time biomonitoring programmes as an early warning system for evaluating the effluent quality of sewage treatment plants (STPs). These systems are based on recording behavioural changes in the test organism resulting from the stress caused by the effluents. Indeed, altered behavioural signals could be induced at sublethal concentrations that are significantly lower than the corresponding EC50. However, at present, it is unknown whether the sensitivity of D. magna can be representative of that of other aquatic organisms, particularly benthic macroinvertebrates. An experiment was designed to verify whether D. magna can be employed in biomonitoring programmes for STPs located in alpine areas as a surrogate for cold freshwater best-adapted species. The responses of survival and behaviour alteration to exposure to the effluent of the Tonale Pass plant (Trentino, Italian Alps, 46<c2><b0>N, 10<c2><b0>E; 1799 m a.s.l.) were compared in a laboratory population of D. magna and a wild population of the chironomid Diamesa cinerella. These larvae were collected from the Vermigliana stream 50 metres upstream of the effluent input. Both organisms were exposed for 24 and 48 hrs to the effluent as it is and to three dilutions (/10, /100, /1000). The mortality rate and behavioural responses (using video tracking systems) were recorded. No significant mortality or change in behaviour was observed in the two species when exposed to the undiluted effluent. Exposure to serial dilutions of the treated effluent did not affect the survival of either species but notably altered their behaviour at both exposure times (e.g., the time spent in activity in D. magna and the average speed of movement and the cumulative distance travelled in both), especially when exposed to the ten-times-diluted effluent. Overall, the findings of this study emphasize that even though D. magna and D. cinerella use different behavioural strategies to cope with adverse environmental conditions, their overall sensitivity to treated effluents is similar. Accordingly, the use of D. magna in biological early warning systems protocols seems to also be sufficiently protective for local, cold-adapted species of alpine freshwater ecosystems.},

abstract={We combined a mass balance approach with measurements of air<e2><80><93>water and sediment<e2><80><93>water nitrogen (N) exchange to better understand the mechanisms attenuating N throughputs in a eutrophic coastal lagoon. We were particularly interested in how seasonal shifts in external versus internal N fluxes and the transition from diatom- to cyanobacteria- dominated phytoplankton communities influence N storage and loss to the atmosphere. We found that on an annual basis almost all of the N removed by the lagoon was due to sediment storage following the spring diatom bloom. This period was characterized by high riverine inputs of dissolved inorganic nitrogen, high rates of assimilatory conversion to particulate nitrogen (PN), and net accrual of N in sediments. By contrast, the larger summer bloom was associated with low sediment N storage, which we attribute in part to the presence of positively-buoyant cyanobacteria. Low settling rates during cyanobacteria blooms favored export of PN to the Baltic Sea over sediment accrual in the lagoon. In addition, summer dinitrogen (N2) fixation by cyanobacteria largely offset annual N2 losses via denitrification. These findings show that cyanobacteria blooms diminish N attenuation within the lagoon by altering the balance of N exchange with the atmosphere and by promoting export of particulate N over sediment burial.},

Increasing anthropogenic impacts in Szczecin Lagoon caused an overall decrease ecological status which may influence the system<e2><80><99>s ability to provide services. Assessing ES changes semi-quantitatively via 39 indicators and 22 services, we show a decrease in provisioning and regulating and maintenance and an increase of cultural services<e2><80><99> provision. According to 15 expert valuations, the Curonian Lagoon displays no changes in provisioning but an increase in regulating and maintenance and cultural service provision. We discuss how these results can serve different marine management approaches and support different polices. Through our application we show how the tool can be used to assess ES changes over time and thus provide key information on sustainable use and ES for future generations.},

title={Seasonal multi-annual trends in energy densities of the midges (genus <i>Chironomus</i>) in a Mediterranean temporary wetland (Natural Regional Reserve of the Isonzo River Mouth, Northeast Italy)},
abstract={The present study is an attempt to deepen the knowledge about energy patterns in a detritus-based ecosystem located within a temporary wetland, where changes of water level can affect productivity, turnover of organic matter and the flow-through energy. Energy density was directly measured using an adiabatic bomb calorimeter in samples collected in autumn, spring and summer. Dipterans belonging to the genus Chironomus were the most common and representative invertebrates within the study area. Starting from these measures, a predictive model based on the relationship between energy density and percentage of dry weight was developed, validated and applied to build a multi-annual dataset. This model was used to investigate seasonal energy density trends on longer time-scale, in relation to physical and chemical features, weather conditions and decomposition dynamics. The used approach allowed to build a 3-year dataset and to identify clear seasonal trends; moreover, the application of the model highlighted patterns in relation to precipitation regime, decomposition dynamics and the effects due to variations of these features in the investigated temporary detritus-based system over a multi-annual scale.},

DDx and Hg contamination deriving from past industrial activities in the Pallanza Basin still exceeded SQGs in sediments and QSs in fish, with potential risks for the ecosystem. Banned in Europe in 1985, PCBs showed low residual values, while recent PBDE peaks resulted in the exceedance of the QSs for biota in both lakes, probably due to current industrial activities.

title={Biological characteristics of the rafting bivalve <i>Gaimardia trapesina</i> in the Southern Ocean},
abstract={Rafting invertebrate species represent an important link for the dispersal and colonisation of islands in the Southern Ocean. They are sensitive to changes in hydrodynamics through effects on transport and food availability, particularly in the case of filter-feeding species. This gives them the potential to act as sentinels of environmental change. The rafting kelp-associated Gaimardia trapesina is one such species, widely distributed in the Southern Ocean. In 2015 and 2016, the size structure, diet, and distribution of G. trapesina were examined around the Sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Islands (PEI) to establish benchmark data and explore their potential use for monitoring long-term change. Gaimardia trapesina and its potential food sources were collected and analysed for size structure, attachment strength, and diet, using stable isotope and fatty acid analyses. The populations examined were dominated by relatively small individuals. The strength of attachment to kelp blades was low and the byssal threads showed high elasticity. The PEI lie in the path of the west<e2><80><93>east flowing Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the highest abundances of G. trapesina were found on the downstream sides of both islands, while the species was absent from the western, upstream coasts. Both diet analyses and SIAR mixing models indicated that G. trapesina feeds on suspended particulate matter, while kelp particles contribute minimally to the diet. Considering the wide distribution of G. trapesina, its importance as food for birds and fish, and its sensitivity to environmental conditions, there is good potential to use this species as an indicator of environmental change in the Southern Ocean.},

abstract={The extensive use of copper and booster biocides in antifouling (AF) paints has raised environmental concerns and the need to develop new AF agents. In the present study, 18 alkaloids derived from terrestrial plants were initially evaluated for AF activity using laboratory bioassays with the bryozoan Bugula neritina and the barnacle Balanus albicostatus. The results showed that 4 of the 18 alkaloids were effective in inhibiting larval settlement of B. neritina, with an EC50 range of 6.18 to 43.11<c2><a0><ce><bc>M, and 15 of the 18 alkaloids inhibited larval settlement of B. albicostatus, with EC50 values ranging from 1.18 to 67.58<c2><a0><ce><bc>M. Field trials that incorporated five alkaloids respectively into paints with 20% w/w indicated an in situ AF efficiency of evodiamine, strychnine, camptothecin (CPT), and cepharanthine, with the most potent compound being CPT, which also exhibited stronger AF efficiency than the commercial antifoulants cuprous oxide and zinc pyrithione in the field over a period of 12<c2><a0>months. Further field trials with different CPT concentrations (0.1 to 20% w/w) in the paints suggested a concentration-dependent AF performance in the natural environment, and the effective concentrations to significantly inhibit settlement of biofoulers in the field were <e2><89><a5><e2><80><89>0.5% w/w (the efficiency of 0.5% w/w lasted for 2<c2><a0>months). Moreover, CPT toxicity against the crustacean Artemia salina, the planktonic microalgae Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Isochrysis galbana, was examined.

title={Differences in the respiratory response to temperature and hypoxia across four life-stages of the intertidal porcelain crab <i>Petrolisthes laevigatus</i>},
abstract={For aquatic breathers, hypoxia and warming can act synergistically causing a mismatch between oxygen supply (reduced by hypoxia) and oxygen demand (increased by warming). The vulnerability of these species to such interactive effects may differ during ontogeny due to differing gas exchange systems. This study examines respiratory responses to temperature and hypoxia across four life-stages of the intertidal porcelain crab Petrolisthes laevigatus. Eggs, megalopae, juveniles and adults were exposed to combinations of temperatures from 6 to 18<c2><a0><c2><b0>C and oxygen tensions from 2 to 21<c2><a0>kPa. Metabolic rates differed strongly across life-stages which could be partly attributed to differences in body mass. However, eggs exhibited significantly lower metabolic rates than predicted for their body mass. For the other three stages, metabolic rates scaled with a mass exponent of 0.89. Mass scaling exponents were similar across all temperatures, but were significantly influenced by oxygen tension (the highest at 9 and 14<c2><a0>kPa, and the lowest at 2<c2><a0>kPa). Respiratory responses across gradients of oxygen tension were used to calculate the response to hypoxia, whereby eggs, megalopae and juveniles responded as oxyconformers and adults as oxyregulators. The thermal sensitivity of the metabolic rates (Q10) were dependent on the oxygen tension in megalopae, and also on the interaction between oxygen tension and temperature intervals in adults. Our results thus provide evidence on how the oxygen tension can modulate the mass dependence of metabolic rates and demonstrate changes in respiratory control from eggs to adults. In light of our results indicating that adults show a good capacity for maintaining metabolism independent of oxygen tension, our study highlights the importance of assessing responses to multiple stressors across different life-stages to determine how vulnerability to warming and hypoxia changes during development.},

In the present study, the concentrations of ten metals were determined in mussels (Unio elongatulus eucirrus) and crayfish (Astacus leptodactylus) collected from the Keban Dam Reservoir in Turkey. The significant spatial differences in concentrations of studied metals except As in mussels were not found. However, Co, Cr, Cu, and Zn concentrations in mussels and As, Co, Cu, Fe, Pb, and Zn concentrations in crayfish showed significant seasonal differences. As, Cd, and Mn levels in mussels were about nine times higher than those in crayfish. The concentrations of Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Zn, and inorganic As in crayfish and mussels were lower than maximum permissible levels. When compared with other biomonitoring studies using mussels and crayfish, high concentrations of As, Cd, Co, Cr, and Ni in mussels and Cr and Ni in crayfish were observed due to lithogenic sources and anthropogenic activities in the basin. Bioconcentration factor values of Fe, Mn, Cd, and Zn in mussels and Zn, Cu, Fe, and Co in crayfish were ><e2><80><89>1000, which indicates that both U. e. eucirrus and A. leptodactylus have potential to bioaccumulate these metals.

title={Multi-year succession of cyanobacteria blooms in a highland reservoir with changing nutrient status, Guizhou Province, China},
abstract={Over the last 22 years significant phytoplankton changes in Hongfeng lake reservoir have been observed with multiple years of harmful cyanobacteria blooms (cHABs). Fish farming and other anthropogenic activities from 1994-2001 triggered the harmful blooms. Nine years after the cessation of aquaculture, a conversion from problematic species (Microcystis spp, Aphanizomenon flos-aquae) to the less problematic species P. limnetica and other associated non-cyanobacteria taxa was recorded. Through this period of change, trophic factors (bottom-up) were re-examined, and correlations between cHABs and selected environmental variables were observed. Higher temperatures, nutrients (TN, TP) and available light significantly favored the development of Microcystis spp blooms. With declining nutrient loads, and a decline in TP relative to TN there was a competitive shift from Microcystis summer blooms to the growth of Pseudanabaena limnetica and other non-cyanobacteria. Pseudanabaena limnetica was favored over Microcystis spp when temperatures were <20<c2><b0>C and TP was <0.03 mg L-1. The apparent species succession to P. limnetica was enhanced by a competitive advantage under varied light conditions. Multiple environmental and biotic conditions (not always nutrients) were driving cHABs. Although only a selected number of environmental variables were examined, the CCA analysis supports observations that temperature and nutrients were associated with the species shift. The replacement of cHABs with the growth of less toxic cyanobacteria like P. limnetica, and other algae creates an interesting scenario (new community condition) for the removal of problematic taxa in reservoir systems. Diverting or controlling blooms will have direct implications on water quality and economic remediation initiatives in reservoir and lake management.},

abstract={Pinna nobilis is an endangered species of fan mussel found along coastal Mediterranean waters requiring special attention for conservation. Populations are restricted in number, due to anthropogenic disturbances, disease, and in some areas, low rates of recruitment. To date, the difficulties associated with the identification of planktonic stages have prompted the use of benthic collectors as a proxy for quantifying larval supply, despite important information being lost regarding planktonic processes. We present evidence of spawning utilizing a qPCR assay developed for detecting genomic DNA of P. nobilis to enable specific identification of planktonic stages to augment knowledge of P. nobilis life history. In the Ebro Delta, Spain, it has been used to study what might be limiting their reproduction locally. We demonstrate the ability to differentiate DNA of P. nobilis from other bivalve mollusks and distinguish between fertilized and unfertilized eggs of P. nobilis, which may be a crucial point for understanding the low level of recruitment seen in this natural population. We also show evidence of larval presence during the expected spawning period, although abundance in positive samples were so low that they pose new questions about factors controlling the availability of planktonic stages of P. nobilis.},

These analyses were conducted to determine whether (A) anthropogenic enrichment could be observed and (B) whether enrichment had decreased following the enactment of Clean Water Act legislation in the 1970s. Collections archived in museums allowed comparison of the pre-Columbian period, the mid-20th century, and the early 21st century. The element Cu was consistently elevated above pre-Columbian baselines, while the elements As, Cd, Fe, and Zn were elevated in some collections. Although higher than baseline, concentrations Zn consistently declined from the mid-20th century to modern times, although differences occurred at individual sites. There was evidence for food web influence: the element Mn was significantly negatively correlated to sediment primary productivity as indexed by shell <ce><b4>13C and Cu was positively correlated to trophic position as reflected by shell <ce><b4>15N. Zn correlated to stream order across all time periods. We conclude that a mixture of historic factors affecting pollution control and land use patterns in the watershed led to sometimes conflicting effects on trace element bioaccumulation in mussel shells.},

abstract={Bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) and silver carp (H. molitrix), collectively known as Asian carp, are planktivorous fishes that have invaded aquatic ecosystems throughout the Mississippi River Basin of North America. Consequently, Asian carp management plans (including contractual harvest) have been implemented to prevent range expansion into vulnerable systems such as the Great Lakes. Asian carp harvest also provides an opportunity to assess if control efforts can benefit native fishes. To answer this question, 26<c2><a0>years of standardized electrofishing data were analyzed, focusing on gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum) body condition (Wr) and abundance (catch-per-unit-effort, CPUE) from the Illinois River (Illinois, USA). Gizzard shad data were categorized into pre-Asian carp establishment (1990<e2><80><93>1999), after Asian carp establishment (2000<e2><80><93>2009), and harvest (2010<e2><80><93>2014) periods. Gizzard shad Wr and small gizzard shad CPUE decreased in the entire river after Asian carp invasion, and Wr and large gizzard shad CPUE rebounded where harvest occurred. Contrastingly, small gizzard CPUE has not yet exhibited a positive response to harvest. These mixed results indicate a time-lag may exist between management action and ecosystem response. Ultimately, Asian carp removal may be facilitating improvements in gizzard shad body condition (by increasing forage availability), which may portend a future gizzard shad population rebound.},

title={Production of Calcium-Binding Proteins in Crassostrea virginica in Response to Increased Environmental CO2 Concentration},
abstract={Biomineralization is the complex process by organisms produce protective and supportive structures. Employed by mollusks, biomineralization enables creation of external shells for protection against environmental stressors. The shell deposition mechanism is initiated in the early stages of development and is dependent upon the concentration and availability of calcium carbonate ions. Changes in concentrations of the critical ions required for shell formation can result in malformation of shells. As pCO2 concentrations in the atmosphere continue to increase, the oceans are becoming more acidified. This process, known as ocean acidification (OA), has demonstrated adverse effects on shell formation in calcifying organisms across taxa. Although OA is known to inhibit the shell deposition in mollusks, the impact of OA on the gene regulation of calcium deposition remains unknown. Here we show the responses of four calcium-binding protein genes, caltractin (cetn), calmodulin (calm), calreticulin (calr), and calnexin (canx), to CO2-derived OA using a Crassostrea virginica mantle cell (CvMC) culture model and a larval C. virginica model. These four genes were cloned from C. virginica and the three-dimensional structures of the proteins encoded by these four genes were fully characterized using homologue modeling methods. Although an acidified environment by increased atmospheric pCO2 (1000 ppm) did not result in significant effects on CvMC proliferation and apoptosis, lower environmental pH induced upregulations of all four calcium-binding protein genes in CvMCs. Similarly, increased pCO2 did not affect the growth of larval C. virginica in the early stages of development. However, elevated pCO2 concentrations enhanced the expression of these calcium-binding protein genes at the protein level. The four calcium-binding protein genes demonstrated responsive expression profiles to an acidified environment at both cellular and individual levels. Further investigation of these genes may provide insight into the molecular regulation of mollusk biomineralization under OA stress.},

The objective of our mesocosm study was to investigate and contrast the roles of juvenile common and bighead carp in structuring planktonic invertebrate assemblages, with focus on rotifers. We examined whether predation by juvenile carp was indiscriminate or size-selective with respect to prey size. Furthermore, we examined how changes to large and small prey influenced the potential for compensatory increases of some taxa within prey assemblages. Both species of juvenile carp reduced large zooplankton taxa. However, rotifer responses were variable depending on the taxon and predator combination. Juvenile common carp enhanced abundance for Polyartha and Squatinella, but most taxa were unaffected. Juvenile bighead carp had a more varied effect on rotifer abundance, having no effect on most, reducing Keratella and enhancing Anuraeopsis. We also estimated net filtration volume of the zooplankton community for each of the treatments and found partial compensation in net filtration because of the increased abundance of a few rotifer taxa, but this reduction did not match the depletion of macrozooplankton. Rotifers that benefitted from the presence of fish predators likely responded positively because of reduced predation by mesopredators, because of their short generation times, and/or from reduced competition.},

abstract={Shell damage left by predators constitutes an important source of information on predator<e2><80><93>prey interactions. However, recognition of the origins of shell damage can often be controversial, and needs to be assessed cautiously. More specifically, differentiation between predation- and abiotic-induced shell damage remains challenging. Here, we show the results of tumbling experiments using a bivalve species Dreissena polymorpha in order to determine rates and patterns of shell damage induced by physical forces in high-energy conditions. It is demonstrated that, in contrast to durophagous fish and crab predation, abiotic-induced fragmentation and damage are typically characterized by the presence of distinct abrasive scratches and wear scars on the surface of shell fragments. Furthermore, fragmented shells typically reveal a wide size distribution, and a different degree of sphericity and roundness resulting from abrasion. Importantly, large shell fragments commonly display smooth edges. These data suggest that durophagous predation, which typically induces fragmentation into large and angular shell fragments bearing no wear scars, can be reliably recognized both in present-day environments and in the fossil record.},

title={Water quality impacts of small-scale hydromodification in an urban stream in Connecticut, USA},
abstract={IntroductionConstruction activities in and along urban streams increase the sediment input into surface waters, causing an overall decline in water quality and aquatic ecosystems. In this case study, we investigate the water quality impacts of local hydromodification in an urban stream (discharge 0.4<c2><a0>m3/s). At the site of interest, workers removed a stream crossing consisting of an embankment with culverts and replaced it with a small bridge (single span of 25<c2><a0>m) in an effort to improve flow capacity.MethodsWater samples were taken at four sites along the North Branch Park River in Connecticut, Northeastern United States. Turbidity and dissolved oxygen (DO) were measured in situ, and nitrate and total phosphorus (TP) were measured in the laboratory. Benthic macroinvertebrate samples were also collected and analyzed for taxon richness and Shannon-Weaver species diversity. Data were compared between upstream and downstream sites and before, during, and after hydromodification. We used one-way ANOVA combined with the post hoc Turkey test to derive statistical significance.ResultsDuring construction, turbidity increased temporarily by 60.9% [from 2.48 Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU) over ambient to 4.00<c2><a0>NTU]. Once construction was completed, DO increased locally from 11.0 to 13.0<c2><a0>mg/L. Benthic macroinvertebrate taxon richness and species diversity declined by 61.6 and 32.6% respectively, with no recovery observed in the year following construction. Water quality was only affected within 50<c2><a0>m downstream. Nitrate and TP concentrations were unaffected.ConclusionsSmall-scale hydromodification temporarily increased the turbidity as a result of increased sediment input, approaching the maximum level for clean water (5<c2><a0>NTU). Benthic macroinvertebrate communities declined in the immediate downstream vicinity of construction but are expected to recover soon given that turbidity recovered to pre-construction levels, and DO increased. These outcomes emphasize that environmental assessment is important not only for large-scale hydromodification but also for smaller scale stream modifications.},

title={Signature of postglacial colonization on contemporary genetic structure and diversity of <i>Quadrula quadrula</i> (Bivalvia: Unionidae)},
abstract={Contemporary species distributions and geographic patterns of genetic structure largely reflect pre-historic events, often with subsequent alterations from human influences. The geographic genetic structure of a relatively common and widespread unionid species, Quadrula quadrula, was investigated to reconstruct its postglacial history. Hypotheses regarding colonization routes of Q. quadrula into the Great Lakes basin after the most recent glacial retreat were tested. Samples were collected from Q. quadrula at sites spanning hypothesized glacial refugia and postglacial expansion routes in the Mississippi River drainage, including the Ohio and Missouri rivers, and the Great Lakes. Broad-scale phylogeography and population structure were assessed by sequencing a fragment of the mitochondrial CO1 gene and genotyping eight microsatellites. Results of analyses showed marked differences among the Great Lakes, Mississippi River, and Ohio River drainages, and suggested colonization of the Great Lakes basin from a Mississippian source. Populations showed patterns of isolation by distance: geographic and genetic distances were significantly correlated among Great Lakes populations based on colonization through the Chicago<e2><80><93>Illinois outlet, but not when following the Wabash<e2><80><93>Maumee outlet. All evidence indicates that postglacial colonization of the Great Lakes basin occurred almost exclusively through the Chicago<e2><80><93>Illinois outlet, with subsequent expansion into the lower Great Lakes.},

The effect of ultrasound and its sequential application with sodium hypochlorite (chlorination) upon marine bivalve Mytilus edulis (blue mussel), a massive fouling organism, has been studied and discussed here. The results obtained from the work carried out have shown that 42<c2><a0>kHz ultrasound is better than 28<c2><a0>kHz in accordance with veliger larvae mortality. The 42<c2><a0>kHz ultrasound has enhanced the mortality rate of veliger larvae than only free-residual chlorination up to 99%. On the other side, the 14-mm size mussel was less resistance than 25-mm size mussel to 42<c2><a0>kHz ultrasonication, among the studied two sizes (14 and 25<c2><a0>mm) of the blue mussel.

abstract={The degree of euryhalinity of cephalopod planktonic paralarvae potentially affects the dispersal capacity and distributional range of species. Herein, we tested the hypothesis that O. vulgaris Type II paralarvae would show some tolerance to seawater dilution, evaluated from integrated field and laboratory experiments. Paralarvae were collected from zooplankton samples (salinities of 30.3<e2><80><93>32.6), in the Paran<c3><a1> Bay Estuarine Complex (PBEC), Southern Brazil. In the laboratory, they were exposed to salinities of 28, 30, 33, 35 (control), and 37, from 15<c2><a0>min to 24<c2><a0>h. Survival ranged from 60 to 83%, 73<e2><80><93>100%, and 100% at salinity of 28, 30, and 33<e2><80><93>37, respectively. Body fluid osmolality (BFO), body water content (BWC), and ninhydrin-positive substances (NPS, amino acids) were quantified at salinities of 33, 35, and 37 (with 100% survival). BFO was always isosmotic to the external medium. BWC and the high NPS concentration remained unchanged in all salinities. Thus, these paralarvae tolerate some deviation from seawater salinity, displaying osmoconforming behavior, maintain body hydration, and show high ability of tissue volume/water regulation in short periods of time. Presumably, this physiological capacity of paralarvae might be one factor allowing their dispersal and survival along environments with moderate deviations from seawater salinity.},

title={Microscopy versus automated imaging flow cytometry for detecting and identifying rare zooplankton},
abstract={Many zooplankton surveys underestimate species richness owing to difficulties in detecting rare species. This problem is particularly acute for studies designed to detect non-indigenous species (NIS) when their abundance is low. Our goal was to test the difference in detection efficiency between traditional microscopy and image analysis (i.e., FlowCAM). We hypothesized that detection of rare species should become easier as they become abundant in a sample, if they are morphologically distinct, or if counting effort increased. We spiked different densities of Cladocera into zooplankton samples from Lake Ontario to simulate rarity, and assessed detection rate. Our results indicated that there was a positive relationship between the probability of finding at least one spiked NIS and its abundance, distinctiveness, and counting effort employed. FlowCAM processed more subsamples, though morphologically similar taxa were distinguished more readily with microscopy. The expected probability for detecting one individual spiked into a sample with ~<c2><a0>8000 individuals (300 counted) was 3.60%, though observed values were considerably lower using both classical microscopy (4.58<c2><a0><c3><97><c2><a0>10<e2><88><92>3 to 1.00%) and FlowCAM (0.10 to 3.00%).

title={Does Mussel Farming Promote Cost Savings and Equity in Reaching Nutrient Targets for the Baltic Sea?},
abstract={Mussel farming has been suggested as a low-cost option for reducing nutrient content in eutrophied waters. This study examines whether mussel farming contributes to reductions in total nutrient abatement cost and increases in equity for achieving nutrient load reduction targets to the Baltic Sea under different international policy regimes (cost-effective, country targets set by the Baltic Sea Action Plan (BSAP), and nutrient-trading markets). A cost-minimizing model is used to calculate the cost savings, and the analytical results show that mussel farming is a cost-effective option only when the marginal abatement cost is lower than for other abatement measures. The numerical cost-minimizing model of the Baltic Sea indicates that the largest abatement cost reductions from introduction mussel farming, approximately 3.5 billion SEK (9.36 SEK = 1 Euro), are obtained under the cost-effective and nutrient-trading systems. Equity, as measured by abatement cost in relation to affordability in terms of gross domestic product, is improved by mussel farming under the cost-effective regime but reduced under the BSAP country targets and nutrient-trading regimes.},

abstract={Post-settlement dispersal potential of four commercial bivalve species (Mytilus edulis, Pecten maximus, Venus verrucosa and Ruditapes philippinarum) were studied through the assessment of recruits' sinking velocities by using a sinking velocity tube of five meters height. In parallel, dynamics of shear stress were monitored for five months on a tidal habitat characterized by the presence and the dispersal of the four species. By coupling both datasets we propose first theoretical estimates of temporal windows of secondary migrations. These experiments revealed interspecific differences in migration potential relate to shell shapes and behaviour, especially to secretion of byssal threads. The sensitivity to passive and active post-settlement migrations seems to rely on the synchronisation between the arrival on the sediment, the tidal regime (spring tide, neap tide), but also the rate of growth of the recruits. The present study confirms that patterns of secondary migrations of bivalve recruits result from a close physical-biological coupling involving benthic boundary layer (BBL) hydrodynamics and shell morphology as well as eco-ethological responses to environmental conditions but clearly modulated by the growth dynamics until a threshold size when drifting is no longer possible.},

abstract={This is a review of over 400 published research papers on free-living, non-testate amoebae during the approximate last half century (1965-2017) particularly focusing on three topics: Biogeography, Ecology, and Physiology. These topics were identified because of the substantial attention given to them during the course of the last half century, and due to their potential importance in issues of local and global expanse, such as: aquatic and terrestrial stability of habitats, ecosystem processes, biogeochemistry and climate change, and the role of eukaryotic microbes generally in ecosystem services. Moreover, there are close epistemological and thematic ties among the three topics, making a synthesis of the published research more systematic and productive. The number of reviewed publications for each of the three individual topics is presented to illustrate the trends in publication frequencies during the historical period of analysis. Overall, the number of total publications reviewed varied somewhat between 1965 and early 2000 (generally less than 10 per year), but increased to well over 10 per year after 2000. The number of Biogeography and Ecology studies identified in the online citations increased substantially after the mid 1990s, while studies focusing on Physiology were relatively more abundant in the first decade (1965-1974) and less were identified in the 1985 to 2004 period. Citations to the literature are listed in tables for each of the three topics for convenience in retrieving references to specific aspects, and representative examples of the cited research in the tables are reviewed in the text under subheads dedicated to each of the three topics. Biogeographic studies largely focused on the geographic distribution and localized patterns of occurrence of amoebae, with more recent studies incorporating more attention to likely correlates with environmental and biotic factors in the distribution and community composition of amoebae. Ecological studies reviewed in the later decades tended to focus more on community dynamics, the effects of environmental variables on communities (including climate-related topics), a trend toward more physiological ecology studies, combined field-based and experimental studies, and incorporation of newer methodologies such as molecular genetics. In general, physiology studies in the first decades of the review tended to focus on topics of cell physiology such as basic biochemistry, enzyme assays, mechanisms of cell division and development, encystment, and motility. Later studies examined broader topics such as osmoregulation, nutrition, fine structure evidence of cellular changes during the life cycle (including encystment and excystment), and issues related to asexual and sexual reproduction, with increasing substantial evidence of evolutionary patterns and phylogenetics based on molecular evidence. A final section on Conclusions and Recommendations summarizes the findings and presents some potentially productive approaches to future research studies on Amoebozoa within the three designated topics of analysis.},

abstract={Chironomidae are a major group of littoral secondary producers whose spatial changes in assemblage structures are shaped by diverse variables. Using their subfossil remains, we aimed at disentangling the relative impact of environmental, topographic, littoral occupation and hydrodynamic variables on the littoral assemblages as well as identifying taxa and sites of primary importance for the <ce><b2>-diversity in a large lake (Lake Bourget). A redundancy analysis coupled with a variance partitioning indicated that 22<e2><80><89>% of the assemblage variability was explained by slope, carbonate concentration and littoral occupation. A non-negligible fraction of non-separable variance among these variables likely highlights the topographic constraint on anthropogenic development and environmental conditions. Taxonomic turnover overwhelmingly (93.2<e2><80><89>%) dominated the assemblage changes indicating site-specific taxonomic composition. The taxa contribution to <ce><b2>-diversity was positively correlated with their mean abundances. The local abundances were either positively or negatively correlated with local contribution of sites to <ce><b2>-diversity (LCBD) providing evidence for different contributions of taxa to <ce><b2>-diversity. A couple of taxa (i.e. Cricotopus spp., Microtendipes sp. and Cladotanytarsus sp.) and sites (i.e. LB57, LB31, LB2) clearly supported the major variations of <ce><b2>-diversity and are therefore identified as being of primary importance regarding conservation programs. Both LCBD variations and taxa spatial autocorrelations suggest that chironomid assemblages were the most variable at a spatial-scale ranging from 500<e2><80><89>m to 1<e2><80><89>km, characterizing the spatial successions of littoral contexts.

Bioindicators that primarily describe the total concentration of the respective pollutant are very useful tools to aid in the chemical analysis of water in order to obtain knowledge about the levels of pollutants in the environment. This study therefore used Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy (ESR) to detect the presence of transition metals (copper, iron and manganese) and possible radicals present in samples of Neoechinorhynchus curemai and its host tissues Prochilodus lineatus, as well in water and sediment of the Batalha River, at the same sample site where fish were collected. Spectral analysis of samples showed the presence of three metals (Cu2+, Fe3+ and Mn2+), in addition to nitric oxide (NO) and humic acid (HA). Quantification of the elements in the samples was possible only for Cu detected in the spectrum of parasites, which was equivalent to 2 ppm. ESR proved to be efficient in the detection of transition-metal ions (Cu2+, Fe3+ and Mn2+), in addition to NO and HA. However, the low concentration values of these compounds in P. lineatus tissues (liver, muscle and intestine) and in the water and sediment samples collected did not allow their quantification, as they were below the limit of detection.

title={Barriers to Effective Eutrophication Governance: A Comparison of the Baltic Sea and North American Great Lakes},
abstract={The Baltic Sea and the North American Great Lakes are two transboundary watersheds that are at risk from similar environmental stressors including nutrient enrichment, hydrologic modifications, chemicals of emerging concern, and the overarching stressor of climate change. Although located in different geographical regions of the world, both watersheds are governed in a multilevel governance setting with many layers of decision makers including global, national, governmental, regional, municipal, and community levels. Despite governance innovations, such as the Helsinki Convention in 1974 and the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement in 1972 and their updated versions, both transboundary waters are under increasing stress from eutrophication. There are provisions in both the Helsinki Convention and the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement for nutrient abatement measures, yet algal blooms abound in both waters, especially after precipitation events. This paper looks at the governance processes in both transboundary ecosystems, with the aim of highlighting governance barriers to eutrophication mitigation using four analytical lenses. A comparison of the two systems and the governance barriers shows that similar and unique challenges are faced in both regions, and the choice of analytical lens affects the perception of barriers and implementation actions. This is useful for policymakers in planning intervention strategies to tackle the stressor of nutrient enrichment in both regions.},

Integrated samples were analyzed for phytoplankton biovolume and nine water quality parameters. We conducted cluster analysis, principal components analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling methods for water quality and phytoplankton taxon-specific biovolume for the Great Lakes basin and for each lake separately. There were significant lake-to-lake differences, and based on lake-specific analyses, Lake Superior, Lake Michigan and Lake Erie were each divided into three zones; Lake Huron and Lake Ontario were each grouped into two zones. The zones identified by water quality and phytoplankton provide an understanding of spatial distributions for evaluating monitoring data.},

abstract={Mussel commercial production depends on wild populations to obtain the seed. Therefore, any new farming initiative needs deep knowledge on reproductive cycle of native mussel populations. The reproductive cycle of Mytilus galloprovincialis Lmk. from five sites, three estuarine and two coastal, along the coast of the Basque Country were assessed using gonad index and stereology over 2 consecutive years (2010 and 2011). Sex ratios, developmental stages of gonads , as well as reserve tissue cycle were analyzed. The onset of gametogenesis was observed from winter to spring, with spawning occurring from spring till summer. A resting phase followed with an increase in reserve tissues (adipogranular cells) was observed in fall. Mussels stayed ripe during winter until favorable environmental conditions were met in spring. Differences in reproductive cycles were found among populations, and also, year-to-year variability was observed within each population. In two of the studied sites asynchrony in the timing of spawning was observed between genders. These timing differences, however, did not prevent mussels at those sites from reproducing successfully. The Bidasoa estuary points to the potential of such studied sites for becoming the main source of wild mussel spats for future expected commercial mussel farming in the Basque Country. To ensure year-to-year maximum reproductive output, however, wild mussels harvest should be avoided from spring to the end of summer in this region.},

abstract={Microcystins produced by freshwater cyanobacteria pose serious threats to human health and are a growing problem in drinking water supplies worldwide. Toxin detection and identification in water reservoirs when cyanobacterial density is still low is a key step to predict harmful algal blooms and to allow the safe use of the resource. For this purpose, developing sensitive and rapid methods of analysis is crucial. Adopting a strategy that couples the use of a filter-feeder organism (Unio elongatulus, Pfeiffer 1825 (Bivalvia: Unionidae)) with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization<e2><80><94>time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) technology, effective microcystin detection was achieved. The performances of MALDI-TOF MS, high-liquid-performance chromatography with diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) test were compared. The results obtained in this study suggest that the exploitation of an efficient bio-accumulator organism, coupled with a rapid and sensitive analytical method, can be a very useful strategy in monitoring programs for early and prompt risk management.},

title={Modeling spring-summer phytoplankton bloom in Lake Michigan with and without riverine nutrient loading},
abstract={There were two phytoplankton blooms captured by remote sensing in Lake Michigan in 1998, one from March to May, and one during June. In this paper, those phytoplankton blooms were simulated by a coupled physical<e2><80><93>biological model, driven by observed meteorological forcing in 1998. The model reasonably reproduced the lake currents. The biological model results, with and without riverine nutrient loading, were compared with the remote sensing data. A 3-month-long donut-like phytoplankton bloom that appeared in southern Lake Michigan was reasonably well simulated only when riverine input was included, indicating the importance of riverine nutrient input for supporting the growth of phytoplankton in Lake Michigan. The model with riverine input also captured a second event-driven phytoplankton bloom during June with weaker magnitude that occurred in mid-south Lake Michigan, which lasted for about 20<c2><a0>days. The major reason for the weaker bloom in June was that vertical mixing in the hydrodynamic model was too weak (leading to a mixed-layer depth of 20<c2><a0>m) to bring the bottom nutrient-rich water up to the epilimnion. High chlorophyll concentration that persisted in Green Bay for almost a year was simulated with less intensity.},

Measuring stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes in Mytilus galloprovincialis to elucidate the sources of organic matter in three different nearshore marine environments. Journal ofCoastal Research, 33(5), 1172-1181. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes (S13C and S15N) in mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) were used to elucidate the sources of sedimentary organic matter in nearshore marine environments at three different locations: (1) Naples harbour, (2) Formia harbour, and (3) Gulf of Gaeta (Tyrrhenian Sea). The sites showed different environmental characteristics, with the latter one considered as the control site, because it hosts "mussel farms" cultivated for human food. Significant differences in both S13C and S15N were found at Naples harbour compared to the other two sites. In particular, the lowest S15N (>4%o) and the highest S13C (>1.6%) values were found in mussels collected in Naples harbour, while similar S13C and S15N values were detected in Formia harbour and in the Gulf of Gaeta. As shown by a Stable Isotope Analysis in R (SIAR)-mixing model, 15N-depleted and 13C-enriched mussels highlight the influence of anthropogenic inputs on this area, particularly of organic fertilizers.},

abstract={Diverse measurements of nutrient status indicators were used to test the severity of physiological phosphorus (P) limitation of phytoplankton among lake systems ranging from oligotrophic to eutrophic, based on P and chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations. Metabolic assays and particulate nutrient ratios were used to estimate nutrient status at sites located in Lake Erie, Lake Ontario and Lake Huron. Variable fluorescence ratios (F v/F m), relative electron transport rates and their response to irradiance were measured by the pulse-amplitude-modulated fluorometer. Under summer stratified conditions, P deficiency was strongest in the oligotrophic sites and nitrogen (N) status indicators and Chl a variable parameters revealed no severe N deficiency. Nutrient amendment assays showed positive associations with P additions and Chl a fluorescence parameters at P-deficient sites. In the most oligotrophic sites, N additions revealed a modest increase only detected by the Chl a fluorescence parameters. Phytoplankton communities were also associated with nutrient status, where chrysophytes and cryptophytes were important in P-deficient sites and cyanobacteria, phyrrophyta, and diatoms were prevalent in nutrient-rich sites. The results confirmed that Chl a fluorescence parameters can reveal P deficiency and indicate its severity among the range of trophic status in aquatic systems.},

abstract={To evaluate the potential of Branchinella kugenumaensis for cyanobacterial bloom control relative to Daphnia, we conducted several feeding experiments on microcystin-free and microcystin-containing unicellular strains of Microcystis aeruginosa and colonial forms of Microcystis using B. kugenumaensis and Daphnia magna in a laboratory. Branchinella kugenumaensis showed higher filtration rates than those of D. magna in all treatments. In particular, the microcystin-containing unicellular strain supported the highest filtration rates of B. kugenumaensis among treatments. Daphnia magna reduced colonies less than 75<c2><a0>[mu]m in length, whereas B. kugenumaensis could graze colonies less than 100<c2><a0>[mu]m. The middle-sized group of B. kugenumaensis had a higher filtration rate than the small and large sized groups in a continuous feeding experiment for 4 days. In survival experiments, survivorships were not different between the two species, whereas ages at the beginning of the experiments affected their survival time. Our results showed that B. kugenumaensis grazed on toxic and colonial cyanobacteria at relatively high rates, indicating that locally abundant grazers like Branchinella may offer a better potential for bloom control than Daphnia.},

abstract={Organochlorine contaminants were measured in livers of wild mink (Neovison vison) trapped in the lower Great Lakes basin from 1998 to 2006. To assess exposure and potential risk in mink feeding on Great Lakes biota, concentrations of contaminants were compared in mink trapped within 7.8 km of the shoreline as well as at inland sites (i.e., 8-40 km). Overall, significant spatial variation in mean hepatic concentrations of sum PCBs and seven other organochlorines was found in mink from 13 Great Lakes sites, many of which are within the Great Lakes Areas of Concern. Mean sum PCB concentrations, on a lipid weight basis, ranged from 2<c2><a0>[mu]g/g in mink from inland Lake Ontario sites to 44<c2><a0>[mu]g/g in mink from western Lake Erie. Concentrations of other organochlorines in mink were generally low. Mink from western Lake Erie had the highest mean cumulative organochlorine burdens dominated largely by PCBs. A significant age effect was found with 1-year-old mink having significantly higher PCB burdens than mink less than 1 year in age. With respect to published PCB threshold effect concentrations, some mink exceeded those associated with effects on reproduction and survival as well as the presence of jaw lesions. This was most consistently found in western Lake Erie where the health of populations of wild mink may be adversely affected and where no mink 2 years of age or older were collected.},

abstract={Biotic interactions are particularly relevant in stable environments, such as the High Antarctic areas. Among them, predation has a key role in structuring community and population variables, including size-frequency distribution. This study aims to quantify the impact of predation by the notothenioid fish Trematomus bernacchii on the Antarctic scallop Adamussium colbecki-size distribution. We developed a model of this impact that estimates the size distribution of the preyed scallop population, taking into account for the predator-size distribution, sex structure, and daily consumption. Comparing this size distribution of the preyed A. colbecki with the living populations at Terra Nova Bay (Ross Sea, Antarctica), we were able to detect a relevant impact of fish predation. Fish-size frequency resulted to be the major factor shaping prey-size structure, with significant differences between predation by males and females. Our findings, given the key role of the two species in the littoral ecosystem of Terra Nova Bay (Antarctic Special Protected Area 161), fall into the framework of ecosystem management of High Antarctic coastal areas, particularly in the actual context of climate change, and increasing anthropogenic impact.},

title={Neutral Evolution and Dispersal Limitation Produce Biogeographic Patterns in Microcystis aeruginosa Populations of Lake Systems},
abstract={Molecular observations reveal substantial biogeographic patterns of cyanobacteria within systems of connected lakes. An important question is the relative role of environmental selection and neutral processes in the biogeography of these systems. Here, we quantify the effect of genetic drift and dispersal limitation by simulating individual cyanobacteria cells using an agent-based model (ABM). In the model, cells grow (divide), die, and migrate between lakes. Each cell has a full genome that is subject to neutral mutation (i.e., the growth rate is independent of the genome). The model is verified by simulating simplified lake systems, for which theoretical solutions are available. Then, it is used to simulate the biogeography of the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa in a number of real systems, including the Great Lakes, Klamath River, Yahara River, and Chattahoochee River. Model output is analyzed using standard bioinformatics tools (BLAST, MAFFT). The emergent patterns of nucleotide divergence between lakes are dynamic, including gradual increases due to accumulation of mutations and abrupt changes due to population takeovers by migrant cells (coalescence events). The model predicted nucleotide divergence is heterogeneous within systems, and for weakly connected lakes, it can be substantial. For example, Lakes Superior and Michigan are predicted to have an average genomic nucleotide divergence of 8200 bp or 0.14%. The divergence between more strongly connected lakes is much lower. Our results provide a quantitative baseline for future biogeography studies. They show that dispersal limitation can be an important factor in microbe biogeography, which is contrary to the common belief, and could affect how a system responds to environmental change.},

title={Passive transport of a benthic bivalve (Corbicula fluminea) in large lakes: implications for deepwater establishment of invasive species},
abstract={Once introduced into a new ecosystem, the benthic bivalve Corbicula fluminea (Asian clam) will spread rapidly through both active and passive transport. In Lake Tahoe, CA-NV, where C. fluminea was introduced in 2002, populations have been found to thrive at shallow depths, where individuals are reproductive, but also at deeper depths where the only possible mechanism of population growth is downslope recruitment. This study used a variety of field and laboratory measurements to parameterize a hydrodynamic drag force model to predict passive clam transport under varying flow conditions. Laboratory results for clam shells ranging from 5 to 20 mm in length under flow conditions from 10 to 25 cm s-1 were used to solve for drag and lift coefficients. Field results are presented during weak stratification (September 2010-March 2011) when cooler water temperatures acted as a potential stressor for buried individuals to rise to the surface and be subjected to flows from which they would otherwise be isolated. During episodic wind events throughout this time period, peak horizontal water velocities of 25 cm s-1 and peak vertical (downwards) water velocities of 4 cm s-1 were measured in which all size classes of adult C. fluminea were potentially transported. Using a fundamental hydrodynamic drag force model approach to predict passive transport, the results of this study can be extended to other bivalve species for a wide array of flow conditions.},

Over 90% of the lake's annual water input enters from tributaries to this basin. Southern areas of the western basin are strongly influenced by nutrient-rich waters from the Maumee River and the Sandusky River, whereas the northern portion is largely influenced by nutrient-poor waters from Lake Huron and Lake St. Clair via the Detroit River.

We identified a total of 647,174 individual helminths from 40 taxa, including 20 trematodes, 14 cestodes, 4 nematodes and 2 acanthocephalans parasitizing lesser scaup within the study area. Lesser scaup were each infected with 2-23 helminth taxa. One digenean, Plenosoma minimum, is reported for the first time in lesser scaup and in the Midwest. Mean trematode abundance and total helminth abundance was significantly less in 2015 than 2014, and we suspect that colder weather late in 2015 impacted the intermediate host fauna and caused the observed differences. Brillouin's species diversity of helminths was greatest in the northernmost region of the study area, which coincides with the range of a non-indigenous snail that indirectly causes annual mortality events of lesser scaup. While host age and size were not determined to be influential factors of helminth infracommunity structure, non-parametric ordination and permutational analysis of co-variance revealed that year and region of collection explained differences in helminth infracommunities. Our results suggest that spatiotemporal variations play an important role in the structure of intestinal helminth infracommunities found in migrating lesser scaup hosts, and may therefore impact host ability to build endogenous reserves at certain stopover locations in the Midwest.},

The diagnostic ratios of individual PAHs and principal component analysis indicate both petrogenic and pyrogenic sources with significant dominance of pyrogenic source. The first PAHs biota-sediment accumulation factors and relative biota-sediment accumulation factors data for short-neck clam were obtained in this study, indicating a preferential accumulation of lower molecular weight PAHs. Evaluation of PAH levels in sediments and short-neck clams indicates that short-neck clam could be introduced as a good biomonitor in mudflats. The results also demonstrated that under environmental conditions, the sedimentary load of hydrocarbons appears to be one of the factors controlling their bioavailability to biota.},

abstract={It is particularly difficult to identify bivalve species at early development stages (larvae and spat) by morphological examination. Targeting genetic marker commonly used for species identification, we developed a cheap and user friendly tool for bivalve identification through High-Resolution Melting (HRM) analysis. Based on the polymorphism of the nuclear 18S ribosomal RNA gene among 11 orders of bivalve, the 18S-HRM method allowed discriminating species of the Ostreida, Mytilida and Pectinida orders. In this study, this method proved to be a very sensitive tool able to authenticate one species that differed by only one mutation from another one. We applied the method by identifying bivalve species in spat collections from different benthic substrates moored at subtidal and intertidal areas in euhaline conditions. This field survey showed that the settlement of the invasive species Crassostrea gigas was limited vertically to intertidal substrates. In conclusion, the 18S-HRM analysis is a fast, closed-tube method with high resolution and cost effectiveness, and is thus a good alternative method to identify bivalve species. This HRM assay can by applied for species identification of bivalves in the context of ecological management as well as food traceability for bivalves with economical interests.},

Treatment with the highest concentration of SDS elicited two types of alarm response. In a second set of tests, the bivalves were exposed for 6 h to a selected concentration of each chemical. Only SDS led to a dramatic alteration of valve opening, resulting in alarms. This system would have limited applications for monitoring drinking water influent.},

abstract={Mussels have the ability to control biomineral production and chemical composition, producing shells with a range of functions. In addition to biological control, the environment also seems to influence the process of biomineralization; thus, shells can be used as archives of ambient water parameters during the calcium carbonate deposition. Past and present environmental conditions are recorded in the shells in the form of various proxies including Mg/Ca or Sr/Ca ratios. For such proxies to be accurate and robust, the influence of biological effects including the size of studied organism must be examined and eliminated or minimized, so that the environmental signal can be efficiently extracted. This study considers mineralogy and elemental composition of shells representing four size classes of Mytilus trossulus from the Baltic Sea. Obtained results suggest that mineralogy and chemical composition change throughout the shell development due to most likely a combination of environmental and biological factors. The content of aragonite increases with increasing shell size, while the bulk concentrations of Na, Cd, Cu, U, V, Zn and Pb were found to decrease with increasing height of the shells. Therefore, using mussels for environmental monitoring requires analysis of individuals in the same size range.},

abstract={Water bodies of West Siberia mainly belong to the Ob River basin, which is not connected to other basins by shipping canals. The relative isolation of the basin predetermined the major role of industrial fisheries and aquarium trade in alien invertebrate transfer into the basin reservoirs. About 60% of the alien species were introduced into water bodies of West Siberia through industrial fisheries, and about 40% through aquarium fisheries. This paper is the first attempt to supplement a list of alien aquatic invertebrates from the Ob River basin. The data on the spread of 21 known non-indigenous species of invertebrates in this area are available. It should be noted that 7 species were deliberately introduced to enhance food reserves for fish, 8 were released by aquarists, 5 were inadvertently released during fish and forage organism introduction, and 1 (a crayfish) was imported for human consumption. For species with a known establishment period, there was a prolonged lag time in cases of both intentional and inadvertent introduction. The high invasion rate in the relatively isolated water bodies of the Ob River basin is comparable to that in Europe; hence, establishment of control over fishery-induced movement of alien invertebrates is required.},

abstract={An understanding of the environmental factors that determine how clam growth varies in space and time improves effective mariculture and shellfish management. We examined the importance of temperature, salinity and chlorophyll-a in controlling the spatial pattern of Mya arenaria growth, the commercially important soft-shell clam, in the Plum Island Sound estuary in northeastern Massachusetts, USA. We collected clams (>5.08 cm) monthly during the April to November growing season from which we determined growth rate, maximum size (L-infinity), and time to reach a harvestable size. We also surveyed selected sites along the estuary to estimate the relationship between clam size and weight. We collected environmental data along the estuary, and our data were complemented with data collected and maintained by the Plum Island ecosystems long-term ecological research project. Clams reached harvestable size fastest and had the greatest L-infinity at the most oceanic site (Yacht Club) in the estuary. Clams had the smallest L-infinity and were slowest to reach the harvestable size at the least oceanic site (Railroad Meander). The spatial patterns of clam growth were best explained by a positive distribution of salinity. Salinity significantly accounted for 95 % of the spatial variation of clam growth in the estuary. Snow melt in spring increases freshwater input to the estuary and results in the lowest spring salinity during a year, and this explained the upper estuary limit of clam distribution. IPCC-projected climate change will cause sea-level rise and increasing precipitation in the northeastern USA, which will modify the spatial pattern of salinity in the region's estuaries. Our research therefore suggests that future management of M. arenaria, an important economic resource for the local economy, should be concerned with the changes of salinity distribution under climate and land-use change.},

Here, we investigated the effects of Ca2+ on shell formation and element composition of the freshwater bivalve, Corbicula fluminea. Our results showed that increasing aqueous Ca2+ levels from 3 to 6 mM did not facilitate shell production. However, the amounts of Mn, Cu, and Pb incorporated into the shells significantly decreased, indicating the potential competition with Ca2+ in the same transport pathways. Furthermore, blocking the Ca2+ channels by lanthanum and Verapamil significantly reduced Mn, Cu, Zn, and Pb incorporation into the shells, and Mn/Cashell and Cu/Cashell decreased simultaneously when inhibiting the Ca2+-ATPase by ruthenium red. However, the amounts of Mg, Sr, and Ba incorporated into the shells were virtually unaffected, implying that intracellular Ca2+ transport mechanisms are not responsible for their incorporation into the shells. These findings help decipher underlying mechanisms responsible for the element partitioning between the ambient water and the shells.},

title={The effects of environment on Arctica islandica shell formation and architecture},
abstract={Mollusks record valuable information in their hard parts that reflect ambient environmental conditions. For this reason, shells can serve as excellent archives to reconstruct past climate and environmental variability. However, animal physiology and biomineralization, which are often poorly understood, can make the decoding of environmental signals a challenging task. Many of the routinely used shell-based proxies are sensitive to multiple different environmental and physiological variables. Therefore, the identification and interpretation of individual environmental signals (e.g., water temperature) often is particularly difficult. Additional proxies not influenced by multiple environmental variables or animal physiology would be a great asset in the field of paleoclimatology. The aim of this study is to investigate the potential use of structural properties of Arctica islandica shells as an environmental proxy. A total of 11 specimens were analyzed to study if changes of the microstructural organization of this marine bivalve are related to environmental conditions. In order to limit the interference of multiple parameters, the samples were cultured under controlled conditions. Three specimens presented here were grown at two different water temperatures (10 and 15<c2><b0>C) for multiple weeks and exposed only to ambient food conditions. An additional eight specimens were reared under three different dietary regimes. Shell material was analyzed with two techniques; (1)<c2><a0>confocal Raman microscopy (CRM) was used to quantify changes of the orientation of microstructural units and pigment distribution, and (2)<c2><a0>scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to detect changes in microstructural organization. Our results indicate that A. islandica microstructure is not sensitive to changes in the food source and, likely, shell pigment are not altered by diet. However, seawater temperature had a statistically significant effect on the orientation of the biomineral. Although additional work is required, the results presented here suggest that the crystallographic orientation of biomineral units of A. islandica may serve as an alternative and independent proxy for seawater temperature.},

title={Applications and perspectives on microfluidic technologies in ships and marine engineering: a review},
abstract={More than 71% of the earth's surface area is occupied by ocean, and the shipping has become one of the most common forms of transportation. There are many applications for rapid on-site detection in ships and marine engineering in general. However, owing to the limited space and environmental conditions, large-scale laboratory equipment cannot be utilized on ships and offline examination methods cannot meet the needs for rapid detection and analysis of problems. Microfluidic technologies provide an excellent platform where various biological and chemical reactions can be completed on very small microfluidic chips. The combination of microfluidic technologies and ship and marine engineering will have important theoretical significance and practical value. These applications mainly include ballast water analysis, lubricating oil analysis, monitoring oil spill, ship exhaust gas detection and ship sewage detection. Therefore, in this paper, we have summarized the current applications of microfluidic technologies in ships and marine engineering and suggested prospects for the potential research directions in the future.},

title={The Hydra regeneration assay reveals ecological risks in running waters: a new proposal to detect environmental teratogenic threats},
abstract={The regenerative ability of Hydra vulgaris was tested as potential biomarker for the development of a new eco-toxicological index. The test is based on the regeneration rate and the aberration frequency of the columna (body and adhesive foot) after separation from head and tentacles by a bistoury. Particularly, 45 columnae were submerged in the rearing solution (that is Hydra medium) to have control, and 285 in potential contaminated waters to have treatments, collected from 19 sites along 10 rivers in central Italy. ANCOVA and chi-square tests were used to compare values from each site to a laboratory control. Subsequently the values on regeneration rate and aberration frequency were inserted in a double entry matrix, where the match of the two entries in the matrix provides the score of the proposed Teratogenic Risk Index (TRI). Each score corresponded to one of the 5 teratogenic risk classes, to which a risk level was associated: from 1 (no risk) to 5 (very high risk). On the whole, 32% of the studied sites were classified as no teratogenic risk while the remaining showed a variable risk level from low to very high. This study proposed for the first time an early warning system to detect the presence of teratogens in running waters, providing a rapid and cost-effective evaluation method. Therefore, TRI may contribute to initiate adequate measures to manage riverine habitats, and to monitor the running water teratogenic status. Specifically, this index may provide the opportunity to identify the disturbance sources and then to drive the decisions, together with competent authorities, on the catchment and landscape management and on the possible use of waters for urban, agricultural, and industrial activities, since they may show significant effects on the human health.},

title={Rare but large bivalves alter benthic respiration and nutrient recycling in riverine sediments},
abstract={(ProQuest: ... denotes formulae and/or non-USASCII text omitted; see image) Bioturbation studies have generally analyzed small and abundant organisms while the contribution to the benthic metabolism by rare, large macrofauna has received little attention. We hypothesize that large, sporadic bivalves may represent a hot spot for benthic processes due to a combination of direct and indirect effects as their metabolic and bioturbation activities. Intact riverine sediments with and without individuals of the bivalve Sinanodonta woodiana were collected in a reach with transparent water, where the occurrence of the mollusk was clearly visible. The bivalve metabolism and its effects on sedimentary fluxes of dissolved gas and nutrients were measured via laboratory incubations of intact cores under controlled conditions. S. woodiana contributed significantly to O2 and TCO2 benthic fluxes through its respiration and to ......, SRP and SiO2 regeneration via its excretion. The bivalve significantly stimulated also microbial denitrification and determined a large efflux of CH4, likely due a combination of bioturbation and biodeposition activities or to anaerobic metabolism within the mollusk gut. This study demonstrates that a few, large individuals of this bivalve produce significant effects on aerobic and anaerobic benthic metabolism and nutrient mobilization. Random sediment sampling in turbid waters seldom catches these important effects due to low densities of large fauna.},

abstract={Arsenic (As) is found in waters such as seawater, warm springs, groundwater, rivers, and lakes. In aquatic environments, As occurs as a mixture of arsenate and arsenite, with arsenate usually predominating. The unrestricted application of As pesticides, industrial activities, and mining operations has led to the global occurrence of soluble As above permissible levels of 0.010 mg/L. Continuous exposure of freshwater organisms including fish to low concentrations of As results in bioaccumulation, notably in liver and kidney. As a consequence As induces hyperglycemia, depletion of enzymatic activities, various acute and chronic toxicity, and immune system dysfunction. Here we review arsenic chemistry, the occurrence of arsenic in aquatic system, the transformation and metabolism of arsenic; arsenic bioaccumulation and bioconcentration; behavioral changes; and acute and other effects such as biochemical, immunotoxic, and cytogenotoxic effects on fish.},

title={Quantitative assessment of the reliability of chironomid remains in paleoecology: effects of count density and sample size},
abstract={Random distributions for a wide range (1-100,000) of chironomid head capsules (HC) were simulated on a 1-m2 surface. The number of HC found in circular surfaces equivalent to standard core diameters (90 and 63 mm) was estimated 1000 times, over the range of tested densities. For each number of HC found in the samples, the range of simulated densities was estimated using a threshold probability (p > 0.95). This enabled us to develop equations to infer HC density from sample counts. Because of the threshold probability for comparable sample counts, the equations yield higher estimated densities under a random distribution than for a regular distribution. The probability of sampling at least one HC was >0.95 for densities of 900 HC m-2 for the 90-mm core and 1400 HC m-2 for the 63-mm core. For a specific sample count, the range of actual densities was ~10 times higher for the 63-mm core than the 90-mm core. Comparison with field larval densities revealed that most densities were too low to be suitable for annually resolved reconstruction of a quantitative signal, using current corer sizes, although a large number of populations can support sub-decadal analyses. Nonetheless, some lakes exhibit population sizes large enough to reconstruct robust quantitative estimates of past chironomid abundances. This work provides guidance to reconstruct species dynamics and fine-scale time series analyses in paleoecology.},

abstract={Mussels are typical macrofouling organisms in the world. In this study, the interaction between the settlement of Mytilus coruscus plantigrades and bacterial community on coloured substrata was determined. Bacterial communities in biofilms developed on seven coloured substrata were analysed by Illumina Miseq sequencing. The mussel settlement response to coloured substrata with no biofilms was also examined. Flavobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria were the first, second and third most dominant groups in seven biofilm samples. The results suggest that the inducing activities of these biofilms on plantigrade settlement varied with coloured substrata and the lowest percentage of settlement was observed on biofilms on the green substratum. High-throughput sequencing showed that bacterial community in biofilms also changed with the substratum colour. No significant difference in the inducing activity on plantigrade settlement was observed between the coloured substrata with no biofilms. Thus, difference in plantigrade settlement response may be correlated to the changes in bacterial community on coloured substrata. This finding extends current knowledge of interaction among mussel settlement and bacterial community variability.},

abstract={Aim: We investigated the spatial and temporal patterns of abundance and diversity of planktonic ciliate community, in the last undammed stretch of the Upper Paran<c3><a1> River, Brazil. Methods: In order to reach this result, seven field campaigns were performed over two years. Plankton samples were collected from 10 transects through this stretch of the river (230 Km), near the banks and on the center, as well on seven of its tributaries. Results: 118 ciliate species were identified, among which the peritrichs were the most abundant while the order Hymenostomatida was the most specious group. We recorded a remarkable increase in abundance and species richness along the river, especially in the rainy period. Moreover, in this period we found an increase in the beta-diversity along the river, which consists in a remarkable distinction among the low, middle and high stretch ofthe river. In this way, continuous changes in the community structure of planktonic ciliates were evidenced, highlighting the importance of the precipitation and tributaries in the maintenance of the highest regional diversity in the studied area. Conclusion: Our results strongly suggest the requirement for conservation actions with the purpose to maintain those tributaries undammed, in order to avoid biotic homogenization processes and the consequent reduction of aquatic biodiversity in this important neotropical ecosystem.Alternate abstract:Objetivo: Investigaram-se no presente estudo os padr<c3><b6>es espaci<c3><a1>is e temporais da abundancia e diversidade de esp<c3><a9>cies da comunidade de ciliados planct<c3><b3>nicos, no <c3><ba>ltimo trecho livre de barramentos da planicie de inunda<c3><a7><c3><a2>o do alto rio Paran<c3><a1>, Brasil.

abstract={Aim: To verify the temporal dynamics of Limnoperna fortunei larval stages and to identify the main environmental variables driving the larval density patterns in an area highly impacted by reservoirs. Methods: Samplings were performed quarterly, from February to December 2014, in 10 transects along to the Paran<c3><a1> River main channel. For each sample site, 100 L of water were filtered. The filtrated was fixed in alcohol 80%, and the larval stages were counted and classified under the optical microscope. Concomitant to biological collections we took some of the main water variables. We performed a Redundancy Analysis (RDA) in order to summarize the variations in densities of larval stages in relation to the main physical and chemical water variables. Results: We found a total of200,590 L. fortunei larvae, in which 83.6% were identified as the initial stages. The most abundant months in L. fortunei larvae were December and February. The first two axes of RDA sum up 96% of the total data variation, and the most significant environmental variables explaining variations in larval densities were: water temperature, total nitrogen, electrical conductivity, phosphate, dissolved oxygen, depth and ammoniac ion. The warmer months were influenced by the major values of water temperature and depth, besides the higher densities of all larval stages. Conclusions: Our results indicate that L. fortunei reproduction follows a general pattern throughout the upper Paran<c3><a1> River floodplain, what seems to occur mainly between February and December.

abstract={Lake surface water temperatures are warming worldwide, raising concerns about the future integrity of valuable lake ecosystem services. In contrast to surface water temperatures, we know far less about what is happening to water temperature beneath the surface, where most organisms live. Moreover, we know little about which characteristics make lakes more or less sensitive to climate change and other environmental stressors. We examined changes in lake thermal structure for 231 lakes across northeastern North America (NENA), a region with an exceptionally high density of lakes. We determined how lake thermal structure has changed in recent decades (1975<e2><80><93>2012) and assessed which lake characteristics are related to changes in lake thermal structure. In general, NENA lakes had increasing near-surface temperatures and thermal stratification strength. On average, changes in deepwater temperatures for the 231 lakes were not significantly different than zero, but individually, half of the lakes experienced warming and half cooling deepwater temperature through time. More transparent lakes (Secchi transparency >5 m) tended to have higher near-surface warming and greater increases in strength of thermal stratification than less transparent lakes. Whole-lake warming was greatest in polymictic lakes, where frequent summer mixing distributed heat throughout the water column. Lakes often function as important sentinels of climate change, but lake characteristics within and across regions modify the magnitude of the signal with important implications for lake biology, ecology and chemistry.},

abstract={A variety of bivalve mollusks (phylum Mollusca, class Bivalvia) constitute a prominent commodity in fisheries and aquacultures, but are also crucial in order to preserve our ecosystem<e2><80><99>s complexity and function. Bivalve mollusks, such as clams, mussels, oysters and scallops, are relevant bred species, and their global farming maintains a high incremental annual growth rate, representing a considerable proportion of the overall fishery activities. Bivalve mollusks are filter feeders; therefore by filtering a great quantity of water, they may bioaccumulate in their tissues a high number of microorganisms that can be considered infectious for humans and higher vertebrates. Moreover, since some pathogens are also able to infect bivalve mollusks, they are a threat for the entire mollusk farming industry. In consideration of the leading role in aquaculture and the growing financial importance of bivalve farming, much interest has been recently devoted to investigate the pathogenesis of infectious diseases of these mollusks in order to be prepared for public health emergencies and to avoid dreadful income losses. Several bacterial and viral pathogens will be described herein. Despite the minor complexity of the organization of the immune system of bivalves, compared to mammalian immune systems, a precise description of the different mechanisms that induce its activation and functioning is still missing. In the present review, a substantial consideration will be devoted in outlining the immune responses of bivalves and their repertoire of immune cells. Finally, we will focus on the description of antimicrobial peptides that have been identified and characterized in bivalve mollusks. Their structural and antimicrobial features are also of great interest for the biotechnology sector as antimicrobial templates to combat the increasing antibiotic-resistance of different pathogenic bacteria that plague the human population all over the world.},

The deployed set can be entirely hidden under water, which is an advantage in crowded areas. The set is composed of single units, each composed of a tray filled with a substrate, four-legged bridles, and a hanging rope with a removable marker float fixed on top by means of a carabiner clip. The float provides information on the location of deployed trays, and permits proper distribution of next trays to be deployed. After deployment from a boat, the units are connected with a rope, extended on one end by a sinking retrieval rope. The floats are removed immediately after deployment. Any number of units can be deployed to the bottom. It depends on the experimental design and the number of replicates. Retrieval of the set starts with locating the trays by means of GPS, and searching for the retrieval rope by means of a grappling hook dragged behind the boat.

title={Escape Burrowing of Modern Freshwater Bivalves as a Paradigm for Escape Behavior in the Devonian Bivalve Archanodon catskillensis},
abstract={Many freshwater bivalves restore themselves to the sediment water interface after burial by upward escape burrowing. We studied the escape burrowing capacity of two modern unionoids, Elliptio complanata and Pyganodon cataracta and the invasive freshwater venerid Corbicula fluminea, in a controlled laboratory setting varying sediment grain size and burial depth. We found that the relatively streamlined E. complanata is a better escape burrower than the more obese P. cataracta. E. complanata is more likely to escape burial in both fine and coarse sand, and at faster rates than P. cataracta. However, successful escape from 10 cm burial, especially in fine sand, is unlikely for both unionoids. The comparatively small and obese C. fluminea outperforms both unionoids in terms of escape probability and escape time, especially when body size is taken into consideration. C. fluminea can escape burial depths many times its own size, while the two unionoids rarely escape from burial equivalent to the length of their shells. E. complanata, and particularly P. cataracta, are morphological paradigms for the extinct Devonian unionoid bivalve Archanodon catskillensis, common in riverine facies of the Devonian Catskill Delta Complex of the eastern United States. Our observations suggest that the escape burrowing capability of A. catskillensis was no better than that of P. cataracta. Archanodon catskillensis was likely unable to escape burial of more than a few centimeters of anastrophically deposited sediment. The long (up to 1 meter), vertical burrows that are associated with A. catskillensis, and interpreted to be its escape burrows, represent a response to episodic, small-scale sedimentation events due to patterns of repetitive hydrologic or weather-related phenomena. They are not a response to a single anastrophic event involving the influx of massive volumes of sediment.},

title={An Analysis of Ship-Source Marine Pollution in Nigeria Seaports},
abstract={Existing studies indicate that marine pollution control in the ports of developing economies is marred by a lack of administrative control and inadequate provision of waste reception facilities. In Nigeria ports, ship generated waste control services and provision of waste reception facilities are outsourced to private companies with no requirement for an activity audit. Apart from the port authority, other government agencies are also involved in pollution monitoring and control. Hence, functions are duplicated and effective regulation is arguably weakened by conflicts of interest. A scientific based integrated model is therefore proposed to address the managerial problem posed in the control of marine pollution in Nigerian ports. In this paper, we conduct a physico-chemical and microbiological analysis of samples of ships<e2><80><99> wastewater to determine the status of marine pollution in the port environment. The samples were collected from randomly selected ships at berths in seaport locations. The outputs from the analysis are then integrated as inputs into an administrative framework model. The integrated model developed is proposed as an alternative administrative tool for monitoring and controlling pollution in seaports. The policy implications of the developed model are discussed.},

abstract={The Asian clam (Corbicula sp.) is an invasive freshwater bivalve native to Asia, the Middle East, Australia, and Africa. It is now widely distributed around the world producing large ecological and economic impacts. Three well-described invasive lineages form a cryptic species complex with asexual reproduction based on androgenesis. In this study, we collected 175 individuals from different Iberian, European, and North American locations to genetically study Corbicula invasion in the Iberian Peninsula using COI and 28S genes. The use of mitochondrial and nuclear markers allows us to characterize both maternal and paternal inheritance from androgenetic Corbicula locations and to deal with the incongruences caused by egg parasitism. We identified 7 COI and 10 28S haplotypes that grouped individuals within the three invasive Corbicula lineages. Haplotype distribution of mitochondrial and nuclear markers detected genetic divergence between the Ebro Delta location and the rest of Iberian sites, suggesting that at least two invasion episodes occurred in the Iberian Peninsula. Haplotype distribution also suggested secondary contacts between Iberian and other European invaded regions. Additionally, results revealed that nuclear hybridization, a feature more widespread than previously reported, contributes to retain gene diversity in the Corbicula invasion.},

title={Changing agricultural practices: potential consequences to aquatic organisms},
abstract={Agricultural practices pose threats to biotic diversity in freshwater systems with increasing use of glyphosate-based herbicides for weed control and animal waste for soil amendment becoming common in many regions. Over the past two decades, these particular agricultural trends have corresponded with marked declines in populations of fish and mussel species in the Upper Conasauga River watershed in Georgia/Tennessee, USA. To investigate the potential role of agriculture in the population declines, surface waters and sediments throughout the basin were tested for toxicity and analyzed for glyphosate, metals, nutrients, and steroid hormones. Assessments of chronic toxicity with Ceriodaphnia dubia and Hyalella azteca indicated that few water or sediment samples were harmful and metal concentrations were generally below impairment levels. Glyphosate was not observed in surface waters, although its primary degradation product, aminomethyl phosphonic acid (AMPA), was detected in 77% of the samples (mean = 509<c2><a0>[mu]g/L, n = 99) and one or both compounds were measured in most sediment samples. Waterborne AMPA concentrations supported an inference that surfactants associated with glyphosate may be present at levels sufficient to affect early life stages of mussels. Nutrient enrichment of surface waters was widespread with nitrate (mean = 0.7 mg NO3-N/L, n = 179) and phosphorus (mean = 275<c2><a0>[mu]g/L, n = 179) exceeding levels associated with eutrophication. Hormone concentrations in sediments were often above those shown to cause endocrine disruption in fish and appear to reflect the widespread application of poultry litter and manure. Observed species declines may be at least partially due to hormones, although excess nutrients and herbicide surfactants may also be implicated.},

title={Ecology of nonnative Siberian prawn (Palaemon modestus) in the lower Snake River, Washington, USA},
abstract={We assessed the abundance, distribution, and ecology of the nonnative Siberian prawn Palaemon modestus in the lower Snake River, Washington, USA. Analysis of prawn passage abundance at three Snake River dams showed that populations are growing at exponential rates, especially at Little Goose Dam where over 464,000 prawns were collected in 2015. Monthly beam trawling during 2011-2013 provided information on prawn abundance and distribution in Lower Granite and Little Goose Reservoirs. Zero-inflated regression predicted that the probability of prawn presence increased with decreasing water velocity and increasing depth. Negative binomial models predicted higher catch rates of prawns in deeper water and in closer proximity to dams. Temporally, prawn densities decreased slightly in the summer, likely due to the mortality of older individuals, and then increased in autumn and winter with the emergence and recruitment of young of the year. Seasonal length frequencies showed that distinct juvenile and adult size classes exist throughout the year, suggesting prawns live from 1 to 2 years and may be able to reproduce multiple times during their life. Most juvenile prawns become reproductive adults in 1 year, and peak reproduction occurs from late July through October. Mean fecundity (189 eggs) and reproductive output (11.9 %) are similar to that in their native range. The current use of deep habitats by prawns likely makes them unavailable to most predators in the reservoirs. The distribution and role of Siberian prawns in the lower Snake River food web will probably continue to change as the population grows and warrants continued monitoring and investigation.},

title={Cardiac performance: a thermal tolerance indicator in scallops},
abstract={Thermal tolerance has become an active research area in marine poikilotherms due to the influence of increased sea temperature caused by global warming. Previous indicators of thermal tolerance in bivalves are generally laborious and time-consuming and even require killing the specimens. In this study, we demonstrated that heart rate (HR) was a stable and reliable indicator for scallop physiological status by applying an infrared-based cardiac performance monitoring system. The feasibility of HR-based Arrhenius break temperatures (ABTs) as a scallop thermal tolerance indicator was evaluated by investigating ABTs of four species with different thermal limits, including the Yesso scallop (Patinopecten yessoensis), the Zhikong scallop (Chlamys farreri), the bay scallop (Argopecten irradians), and the Catarina scallop (Argopecten ventricosus). In accordance with the thermal limits, ABTs of the Yesso scallop, Zhikong scallop, bay scallop, and Catarina scallop were 22.03<c2><a0><c2><b1><c2><a0>0.19, 29.10<c2><a0><c2><b1><c2><a0>0.25, 32.20<c2><a0><c2><b1><c2><a0>0.25, and 34.09<c2><a0><c2><b1><c2><a0>0.19<c2><a0><c2><b0>C, respectively, suggesting that the ABT could indicate thermal limits in interspecific scallops. Variations in the ABTs were observed among intraspecific scallops with different sizes, weights, and ages, suggesting that smaller and younger scallops tend to have higher thermal limits. Significant differences in ABT were also observed between pre- and post-spawning individuals, implying that spawning behavior could decrease scallop thermal limits. The above results suggest that HR-based ABT can detect not only interspecific but also intraspecific thermal tolerance in scallops. This study reports the feasibility of infrared-based cardiac performance as a rapid, efficient, and noninvasive indicator for bivalve thermal tolerance.},

title={Symbiotic bacteria of helminths: what role may they play in ecosystems under anthropogenic stress?},
abstract={Symbiotic bacteria are a common feature of many animals, particularly invertebrates, from both aquatic and terrestrial habitats. These bacteria have increasingly been recognized as performing an important role in maintaining invertebrate health. Both ecto- and endoparasitic helminths have also been found to harbour a range of bacterial species which provide a similar function. The part symbiotic bacteria play in sustaining homeostasis of free-living invertebrates exposed to anthropogenic pressure (climate change, pollution), and the consequences to invertebrate populations when their symbionts succumb to poor environmental conditions, are increasingly important areas of research. Helminths are also susceptible to environmental stress and their symbiotic bacteria may be a key aspect of their responses to deteriorating conditions. This article summarizes the ecophysiological relationship helminths have with symbiotic bacteria and the role they play in maintaining a healthy parasite and the relevance of specific changes that occur in free-living invertebrate-bacteria interactions under anthropogenic pressure to helminths and their bacterial communities. It also discusses the importance of understanding the mechanistic sensitivity of helminth-bacteria relationships to environmental stress for comprehending the responses of parasites to challenging conditions.},

title={Simulation of the Contribution of Phosphorus-Containing Minerogenic Particles to Particulate Phosphorus Concentration in Cayuga Lake, New York},
abstract={Phosphorus (P) associated with minerogenic particles delivered from watersheds can interfere with the common use of total P (TP) concentration as a trophic state metric in lacustrine systems, particularly proximate to tributary entries, because of its limited bioavailability. The concentration of unavailable minerogenic particulate P (PPm/u), where it is noteworthy, should be subtracted from TP in considering primary production potential and trophic state levels. A first mass balance model for PPm/u is developed and tested here for Cayuga Lake, New York. This is supported by a rare combination of detailed information for minerogenic particle level dynamics for the tributaries and lake, the bioavailability of tributary particulate P (PP), and previously tested hydrothermal/transport and minerogenic particle concentration submodels. The central roles of major runoff events and localized tributary loading at one end of the lake in driving patterns of PPm/u in time and space are well simulated, including (1) the higher PPm/u concentrations in a shallow area ("shelf") adjoining the inputs, relative to pelagic waters, following runoff events, and (2) the positive dependence of the shelf increases on the magnitude of the event. The PPm/u component of P was largely responsible for the higher summer average TP on the shelf vs. pelagic waters and the exceedance of a TP water quality limit on the shelf. The effective simulation of PPm/u allows an appropriate adjustment of TP values to avoid overrepresentation of potential primary production levels.},

abstract={The force required to dislodge mussels from the substrate is known as attachment strength. This feature has been mostly studied in mytilids inhabiting the intertidal of consolidated rocky substrates, whereas it has been less studied in sedimentary substrates. The aim of this study was to evaluate the attachment strength and the number of byssal threads of Brachidontes rodriguezii in two sites with mobile substrates in San Antonio Bay, Argentina [Punta Verde (PV) and Punta Delgado (PD)]. PV has relatively higher current velocities and coarser grain size than PD. Along coastal line transects at two different levels of the mid-intertidal of each site, the attachment strength was measured. The number of byssal threads in collected mytilids and the weight of the sediment adhered to them were recorded in the lab. The attachment strength, the number of byssal threads and the sediment adhered to the byssus differed significantly between levels and sites. Mytilids from the mid-level of both sites where the density was relatively lower, had a significantly greater number of byssal threads and higher weight of sediment adhered. This study reveals that a high amount of coarse sediment adhered to the byssus affects the attachment strength of B. rodriguezii in ecosystems relative to unstable substrates. We underline the importance of mobile substrates in understanding attachment features (attachment strength and byssal threads) of mytilids in this unstable ecosystem.},

The effect of sublethal concentrations of MET was also analysed by assessing biochemical changes and swimming parameters in tadpoles. The LC50 value in P. canaliculata was as 0.50 mg L-1 and in R. arenarun tadpoles, 229.7 mg L-1 at 48 h. The intestine of MET-exposed P. canaliculata exhibited a significant reduction in CbE and CAT activities, but not in AChE activity; hepatopancreas of GAS showed a decreased GST activity decreased with respect to control individuals. In addition, a significant reduction of CbE activities was detected in R. arenarum tadpoles exposed to MET, and AChE presented lower values than the control but without statistical differences. Antioxidant enzymes (GST and CAT) were significantly reduced in tadpoles exposed to MET compared with the control group. In addition, MET had a significant effect on the swimming behaviour of R. arenarum. Finally, since amphibian tadpoles and P. canaliculata often co-occur, other native amphibian species should be studied to elucidate the ecological risk of MET to amphibian populations.},

Using submerged plants (Hydrilla verticillata) as a refuge for Chinese bitterling (Rhodeus sinensis), a native fish, we conducted a series of laboratory experiments to test the impact of structural complexity and prey density on predation rate. We found that the number of Chinese bitterling eaten by alien crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) decreased with the increasing structural complexity and increased with prey density. Similar reductions in predation rate with increased habitat complexity occurred at all three different prey densities. Our study indicates that structural complexity can decrease the crayfish predation on freshwater fishes.},

title={The cycle of mussels: long-term dynamics of mussel beds on intertidal soft bottoms at the White Sea},
abstract={Dense blue mussel assemblages are unstable, their structure changing from year to year. Three types of models can be used to describe this instability: (1) "exogenous" model based on regional temperature fluctuations, (2) "endogenous" deterministic model associated with negative impact of adult mussels on juveniles and (3) "density-linked stochasticity" model based on positive feedbacks resulting in overcrowding and destabilizing the settlement. We compared predictions deduced from these models with a time series based on the results of long-term (18 years) monitoring of abundance and demographic structure of three mussel beds at the White Sea. Most of our findings agreed well with the predictions deduced from the endogenous model. In particular, (1) long-term changes in mussel abundance and demographic structure were strictly cyclic, with non-matching periods (5-9 years) at different sites; (2) stages with the dominance of old mussels alternated with those where juveniles dominated and (3) some signals of delayed density dependence were revealed. However, the time series also contained elements of long-term trends, which may testify to the involvement of some exogenous factors (probably long-term climate changes).},

abstract={Since the 1960s, little has been done to improve and simulate the use of short-duration chronic bioassays of bivalve embryos, particularly in mussels. However, these test organisms offer great advantages in relation to other groups, due to the ease of obtaining breeders in cultivation systems, in the environment and any time, and due to their high sensitivity to chemicals or contaminants. To contribute some methodological aspects, this study uses techniques to stimulate spawning or improve the obtaining of gametes for use in bioassays with the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. It also evaluates different criteria for determining the effect on the larvae, for estimation of EC 50 and NOEC values, based on morphological analysis of developmental delay and the biometrics of the larvae. KCl proved to be a reliable inducer of spawning, with positive responses in 10 of the 12 months of the year tested. Moreover, this chemical, in association with NH 4Cl, demonstrated the capacity to activate immature oocytes obtained from extirpated gonads, enabling an improvement in fertilization rates. The different criteria adopted to determine the effects on the larvae in the assays with reference toxicants (SDS and K 2Cr2O7) resulted in EC50 and NOEC values without significant differences, indicating reliability in the results and freedom in the choice of criteria of effect to be adopted in the trials.},

Here, we studied the large Klang mudflat (Straits of Malacca) from September 2011 to September 2014 to determine the fish species that utilize it and the abiotic factors that influence species composition and abundance, to evaluate the ecological role of the mudflat in support of coastal fisheries. The spatial and temporal assemblage of fish species and their abundance was examined at two sites, during two monsoon seasons, and under the effect of period (wet/dry), moon phase (full/new moon), and diel cycle (day/night). Fish were sampled during ebb tide by a stationary large barrier net that enclosed a calculable area of sampling. A total of 119 species belonging to 46 families of mainly small-sized and juvenile fish made regular ingressions into the mudflat throughout the year. Fish abundance varied spatially and temporally, suggesting site preference and variability in juvenile recruitment. Higher fish abundance due to recruitment occurred during the northeast monsoon season (NEM), as compared to the southwest monsoon. Fish composition but not total fish abundance during the NEM differed between wet/dry periods and diel cycles. Ariidae and Sciaenidae were dominant families during the wet period, whereas Engraulidae dominated during the dry period. Predatory fish species (e.g., Lagocephalus lunaris, Otolithes ruber, and Hexanematichthys sagor) were recorded during the daytime, whereas planktivorous and detrivorous species (e.g., Ambassis gymnocephalus and Liza subviridis) were more abundant during the night.},

title={CYANOCOST special issue on cyanobacterial blooms: synopsis--a critical review of the management options for their prevention, control and mitigation},
abstract={Nuisance, toxic cyanobacterial blooms are a persistent and globally expanding problem. Prevention of blooms requires that external and internal sources of nutrients are managed to levels where development of cyanobacterial blooms is restricted. Control of blooms, in which their presence is reduced to a level where they no longer pose a risk through additional measures such as biomanipulation or artificial mixing, demands that three elements come together: (1) understanding of the key ecological traits of the dominant cyanobacteria taxa, (2) system analysis of the lake, in particular its morphometry, water and nutrient balance, (3) adequate design and execution of the management methods of choice. All three elements are important for choosing effective management interventions and predicting their outcome. Mitigation of blooms reduces the risks and harmful effects of blooms if they cannot be prevented or sufficiently controlled, methods such as harvesting of surface scums or application of cyanocides may be used in those cases where water quality improvement is urgent. Ultimately, managing cyanobacterial blooms is most effective in the context of developing a Water Safety Plan. This is a risk assessment and management approach developed by the World Health Organization and provides a platform for bringing together the stakeholders who have a say about activities in the catchment causing eutrophication. Together, they can develop and implement control measures in the chain from catchment to drinking-water offtake which effectively mitigate eutrophication and thus protect humans and the lake ecosystem services they rely on from effects of toxic cyanobacteria.},

title={Biomanipulation as a nature-based solution to reduce cyanobacterial blooms},
abstract={We considered the limnological literature for an overview of biomanipulation methods that were implemented to avoid or reduce cyanobacterial bloom development in ponds and lakes. For this purpose, we reviewed 48 publications representing 34 whole-lake and large-scale case studies of different biomanipulation approaches clearly mentioning the extent of a cyanobacteria bloom problem and the cyanobacteria taxa involved. This delivered complementary information to the suite of review papers already providing elaborated syntheses on biomanipulation and associated ecotechnological measures as a restoration tool for overall eutrophication reduction and control. We considered nature-based solutions such as fish removal and associated water drawdown, addition of piscivorous fish, filter-feeding planktivorous fish, Daphnia or bivalves, re-introduction of macrophytes and a combination of accompanying restoration methods. Reasons for success or failure to control cyanobacterial blooms of especially Anabaena, Pseudanabaena, Aphanizomenon, Aphanocapsa, Limnothrix, Microcystis, Oscillatoria or Spirulina spp. could be explained through bottlenecks encountered with fish removal, stocking densities, cascading effects, associated zooplankton grazing, diet shifts away from cyanobacteria, macrophyte recovery, nutrient or pH status. Threshold values to avoid failures are synthesized from experiments or monitoring studies and presented in a conceptual scheme about cyanobacteria reduction through (1) direct abatement of existing blooms and forcing/maximization of biotic key interactions (2) reducing risk of blooms and improving lake or pond multi-functionality and (3) avoiding blooms, balancing biotic communities and enhancing existing ecosystem services. More information will be required on temporal dynamics and abundances of cyanobacteria taxa in whole-lake pre- and post-biomanipulation conditions to better evaluate the applicability and effectiveness of such nature-based solutions.},

title={Personality, foraging behavior and specialization: integrating behavioral and food web ecology at the individual level},
abstract={Behavioral traits and diet were traditionally thought to be highly plastic within individuals. This view was espoused in the widespread use of optimality models, which broadly predict that individuals can modify behavioral traits and diet across ecological contexts to maximize fitness. Yet, research conducted over the past 15 years supports an alternative view; fundamental behavioral traits (e.g., activity level, exploration, sociability, boldness and aggressiveness) and diet often vary among individuals and this variation persists over time and across contexts. This phenomenon has been termed animal personality with regard to behavioral traits and individual specialization with regard to diet. While these aspects of individual-level phenotypic variation have been thus far studied in isolation, emerging evidence suggests that personality and individual specialization may covary, or even be causally related. Building on this work, we present the overarching hypothesis that animal personality can drive specialization through individual differences in various aspects of consumer foraging behavior. Specifically, we suggest pathways by which consumer personality traits influence foraging activity, risk-dependent foraging, roles in social foraging groups, spatial aspects of foraging and physiological drivers of foraging, which in turn can lead to consistent individual differences in food resource use. These pathways provide a basis for generating testable hypotheses directly linking animal personality to ecological dynamics, a major goal in contemporary behavioral ecology.},

abstract={We examine the relationship of biomass B and length L in the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica by focusing on the scaling exponent b in the allometric equation B = aLbusing four datasets: Delaware Bay, Chesapeake Bay, Galveston Bay and a regionally extensive compilation from the NOAA Mussel Watch Program. The average value of the scaling exponent in Delaware Bay and Chesapeake Bay is about 2. For Galveston Bay, the value is distinctly higher, near 2.6. Over all Mussel Watch sites, the value is again near 2. Within Delaware Bay, the salinity gradient exerts an important effect. Shells are longer for their meat weight at lower salinities. The range of scaling exponents revealed by Mussel Watch data is exceedingly large (b < 1 to >3). Scaling exponents below 2.5 are unusual in bivalves. Among bivalves, only other oyster taxa have comparably low scaling exponents averaging near 2. We propose that oyster biomass routinely scales nearer the square of the length rather than the cube and that this is a constraint imposed by the exigency of carbonate production for reef maintenance and accretion in the face of high rates of taphonomic degradation. The adaptation as a reef builder requires the formation of carbonate that rapidly breaks down, thus requiring that carbonate produced be maximized. A biomass-to-length scaling exponent of 2 provides a mechanism to maximize shell production relative to biomass, while at the same time providing maximum surface area for the all-important settling of oyster spat to maintain the population.},

Cover, species richness, and species composition of vegetation varied greatly across the 21 study sites, from nearly barren sites to densely vegetated sites. The flora was split about equally between native and nonnative species, and vines were especially well represented. Vegetation cover and composition were correlated with the age, slope, particle size, and roughness of revetments, as well as site exposure and local management practices. We suggest that the ecological functions provided by revetment vegetation vary enormously from site to site along the Hudson, and could be enhanced by deliberate design and management.},

abstract={Anadromous fishes are commonly thought to use inland waters for spawning and for rearing in the first growing season. Thereafter, they emigrate seaward to feed, grow, and mature. However, yearling (age 1+) alosine herrings have been observed in the Hudson River estuary during the spawning season. We quantified the frequency of this behavior for Blueback Herring (Alosa aestivalis) in two contrasting time periods: the 1980s-1990s, a period of relatively high abundance, and 2012-2013, a period of low abundance. Using otolith chemistry, we (1) assayed whether yearlings captured during the spawning run had egressed to sea and then returned to fresh water, and (2) examined adult spawners and retrospectively estimated the frequency of yearling returns to fresh water in these recruited fish. At least 36 % and up to 90 % of yearlings showed evidence of overwintering at sea or very far down the estuary prior to returning to fresh water with the spawning adults. Of the adults, 67-75 % showed evidence of returns up to fresh water as yearlings, despite large changes in population size and demographic characteristics. We conclude that this cryptic, "non-textbook" migratory behavior is common, and suggest that the importance of estuarine and freshwater nurseries may extend beyond the young-of-year period.},

title={Allometric size-scaling of biometric growth parameters and metabolic and excretion rates. A comparative study of intertidal and subtidal populations of mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis)},
abstract={Allometric relationships between biometric parameters (i.e., soft body and shell weights and shell organic content vs. shell length) as well as for routine and standard metabolic and ammonia excretion rates related to flesh weight and shell length were estimated and compared for subtidal and intertidal populations of Mytilus galloprovincialis in Galicia (NW Spain). This is the first report on allometric size-scaling of excretion and metabolic (both routine and standard) rates in this species. No evidences of differences in size exponent were found between physiological rates or between both populations for any physiological rate. Intercepts of regression lines were significantly higher in subtidal than in intertidal mussels, indicating greater levels of energy expenditure in the former. However, metabolic scope for feeding and growth was about two-fold in intertidal mussels, pointing to a reduced growth efficiency compared with subtidal mussels. Evolution of biometric parameters of body components with size indicated that subtidal mussels allocated energy resources preferably into flesh growth, achieving higher condition indices, while intertidal mussels put more effort on shell calcification and thickening which resulted in heavier shells of reduced organic content. These differentiated growth "strategies" of both populations could be related to their differences in growth efficiencies.},

title={Chemical Assessment of Ballast Water Exchange Compliance: Implementation in North America and New Zealand},
abstract={Fluorescence by naturally occurring dissolved organic matter (FDOM) is a sensitive indicator of ballast water source, with high FDOM in coastal ballast water decreasing typically dramatically when replaced by oceanic seawater during ballast water exchange. In this study, FDOM was measured in 92 ships arriving at Pacific ports on the US west coast and in New Zealand, and used to assess their compliance with ballast water regulations that required 95% replacement of port water to minimize invasive species risks. Fluorescence in many ships that reported ballast water exchange was significantly higher than is usual for oceanic seawater, and in several cases, significantly higher than in other ships with similar provenance and ballast water management. Pre-exchange source port conditions represented the largest source of uncertainty in the analysis, because residual coastal FDOM when highly fluorescent can significantly influence the fluorescence signature of exchanged ballast water. A meta-analysis comparing the intensities of FDOM in un-exchanged ballast tanks with calculated pre-exchange intensities assuming that ships all correctly implemented and reported ballast water exchange revealed notable discrepancies. Thus, the incidence of high-FDOM port waters was seven times lower in reality than would be expected on the basis of these calculations. The results suggest that a significant rate of reporting errors occur due to a combination of factors that may include inadequate ballast water exchange and unintentional or deliberate misreporting of ballast water management.},

The results suggest that the mean AVO was significantly decreased in C. fluminea exposed to 0.1 and 1 mg l^sup -1^, and decreased for H. cumingii and A. woodiana after exposure to 10 mg l^sup -1^. The mean FVA was significantly decreased in H. cumingii exposed to 1 and 10 mg l^sup -1^, while A. woodiana revealed lower frequencies only at 10 mg l^sup -1^.

abstract={Both coastal wetlands and tributaries of waterbodies provide important and distinct habitat for freshwater fishes. While diel migration into and out of these systems is known to occur for some species, the resulting changes in fish assemblage composition and dominance are less well understood. To evaluate diel changes in the fish assemblages of a coastal wetland and tributary, fish community surveys were completed at ten locations during the day (noon) and night (midnight) in Cooper's Marsh, a coastal wetland in the St. Lawrence River, and the Raisin River, a nearby tributary. Catch per unit effort (CPUE) and species richness were highest in the coastal wetland during the night sampling period. Species-specific differences were also apparent with high CPUE of Mimic Shiner in the marsh at night. Differences within the river were less pronounced, suggesting less diel variability in fish assemblage structure, possibly driven by the more constrained nature of fluvial systems. These results contribute to our understanding of diel movement patterns of fishes and the natural diel variability in species assemblages that can occur. These findings also emphasize that when engaged in environmental monitoring and assessment, it is important to consider how diel variation in fish assemblage structure will influence conclusions regarding the biotic components of a given aquatic ecosystem.},

title={A novel approach for the development of tiered use biological criteria for rivers and streams in an ecologically diverse landscape},
abstract={Water resource protection goals for aquatic life are often general and can result in under protection of some high quality water bodies and unattainable expectations for other water bodies. More refined aquatic life goals known as tiered aquatic life uses (TALUs) provide a framework to designate uses by setting protective goals for high quality water bodies and establishing attainable goals for water bodies altered by legally authorized legacy activities (e.g., channelization). Development of biological criteria or biocriteria typically requires identification of a set of least- or minimally-impacted reference sites that are used to establish a baseline from which goals are derived. Under a more refined system of stream types and aquatic life use goals, an adequate set of reference sites is needed to account for the natural variability of aquatic communities (e.g., landscape differences, thermal regime, and stream size). To develop sufficient datasets, Minnesota employed a reference condition approach in combination with an approach based on characterizing a stream's response to anthropogenic disturbance through development of a Biological Condition Gradient (BCG). These two approaches allowed for the creation of ecologically meaningful and consistent biocriteria within a more refined stream typology and solved issues related to small sample sizes and poor representation of minimally- or least-disturbed conditions for some stream types. Implementation of TALU biocriteria for Minnesota streams and rivers will result in consistent and protective goals that address fundamental differences among waters in terms of their potential for restoration.},

Knowledge of deep-sea sponge ecology is limited and this leaves us with a fragmented understanding of the ecological roles that sponges play in CWR ecosystems. We present the first study of faunal biodiversity associated with the massive demosponge Spongosorites coralliophaga (Stephens, 1915) that typically colonizes coral debris fields of CWRs. Our study focused on the sessile fauna inhabiting sponges mixed with coral rubble at two contrasting settings in the northeast Atlantic: the shallow inshore (120-190 m water depth) Mingulay Reef Complex (MRC) and the deep offshore (500-1200 m) Logachev Mound (LM) coral province. MRC is dominated by the scleractinian Lophelia pertusa, while LM is dominated by L. pertusa and Madrepora oculata. Nine sponge-coral rubble associations were collected from MRC and four from LM. Measurements of abundance, species richness, diversity, evenness, dry biomass, and composition of sessile fauna on sponge and coral rubble microhabitats were undertaken. Differences in community composition between the two regions were mainly a response to changes in fauna with depth. Fauna composition was also different between sponge and coral rubble within each region. Infauna constituted a minor component of the sponge-associated fauna in MRC but had a higher contribution in LM. Sponge and coral rubble sessile fauna in both regions was mainly composed of cnidarians and molluscs, similarly to some previous studies. Sponges' outer surfaces at MRC were colonized by a species-rich community with high abundance and biomass suggesting that S. coralliophaga at MRC acts as a settlement surface for various organisms but such a role is not the case at LM. This difference in the role of S. coralliophaga as a biological structure is probably related to differences in fauna composition with depth, bottom current speed, and the quantity/quality of food supplied to the benthos.},

abstract={Running waters of Central Europe are progressively invaded by the southwest European amphipod Echinogammarus berilloni--as currently observed in the karstic upper River Lippe catchment (Paderborn Plateau, northwest Germany). We tested experimentally whether the succession of the invader is favored by lower predation intensity of three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) compared to predation on the native gammarids Gammarus pulex and G. fossarum. Predation experiments were combined with two modifiers: species interaction (separate exposure of each species vs. joint exposure of each native species with the invader) and habitat structure (absence vs. availability of refuge structures as hideouts against predation). When the species were exposed separately to the predator and no refuges were offered, predation rates did not differ significantly. When refuges were present, predation success generally decreased, but was relatively lower on the invader E. berilloni than on the native species. When native and the invasive species were exposed jointly to predation, predation success decreased further in both species combinations. However, under both conditions, with and without refuge structures, survival of E. berilloni was significantly greater than in G. pulex. The findings corroborate our assumption that the invader E. berilloni profits from sympatric occurrence with native gammarid species, especially when hideout options are available. Whether this effect was caused by competition for refuges or simply by a relatively lower activity level of E. berilloni and smaller predator stimulus for the fish remains to be cleared. Without doubt, the difference in predation is a factor that contributes to the invader's success.},

The relationships are influenced by environmental conditions and should be applied within ecosystems and geographic regions similar to those for which they were estimated. However, very few relationships exist for littoral macroinvertebrates, and thus we provide length-mass relationships for macroinvertebrates from lakes of the Central European lowlands. We compared log-linear and nonlinear methods for fitting length-mass relationships and tested the smearing factor for removing bias in mass predictions from log-linear models. We also estimated conversion factors to correct for mass changes during ethanol preservation and assessed the transferability of our results to different geographical regions. We showed that the log-linear approach gave better results in fitting length-mass relationships, while residuals showed that nonlinear models over-predict the mass of small individuals. The smearing correction factor successfully removed bias introduced by log transformation, and relationships transferred well between lakes in the same and different geographical regions. In total, 52 bias-corrected length-mass relationships are provided for littoral macroinvertebrates that are applicable also to lakes in geographic regions with similar environmental conditions, such as the Central European lowlands or the temperate lowland zone of America.},

abstract={Nanoparticles have applications in a diverse range of products including medications, detergents, cosmetics, paint, sunscreen and electronics, with an economic worth projected to reach $2.5 trillion dollars in 2015. Research into the effects of manufactured nanomaterials on the environment, however, has failed to keep pace with the high volume of commercial production. Whereas a number of studies have examined the effects of nanoparticles on aquatic species, little work has focused on the way in which benthic marine species encounter, ingest and depurate these materials. The purpose of this study was to examine the ingestion and depuration of titania nanoparticles (anatase) by the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) and the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) during a spill scenario (an acute exposure to elevated concentrations). Bivalves were exposed to nanoparticles either incorporated into marine snow, an environmentally relevant medium for pollutants, or added directly to seawater at a concentration of 4.5 mg L-1 for 2 h. After feeding, the animals were transferred to filtered seawater and allowed to depurate. Faeces and tissues were collected at 0, 6, 24, 72 and 120 h, post-exposure, and analysed for concentrations of titanium by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Results indicated that the capture and ingestion of titania nanoparticles by both species was not dependent on the method of delivery (incorporated into marine snow or freely suspended). Additionally, greater than 90% of the titania nanoparticles, on average, were eliminated from the tissues after 6 h, and only trace amounts remained after 72 h. These data demonstrate that mussels and oysters readily ingest titania nanoparticles, but rapidly depurate the material within hours of an acute exposure suggesting that little would be transferred to secondary consumers including humans. Further research is required to determine if other species of suspension-feeders handle titania nanoparticles in a manner similar to bivalves.},

abstract={The rhythms and responses of animals to environmental factors are important issues for their adaptation to natural cycles. These rhythms assure an optimum synchrony between organisms and their environment. Bio-logging enables monitoring these activity cycles remotely. To characterize rhythms and responses of fan mussels (Pinna nobilis) to environmental factors, six individuals were monitored from April 2009 to October 2011. The study was conducted at a station in the western Mediterranean at 11 m depth in Tabarca Island Marine Reserve (Alicante, Spain). Sensors at the station monitored dissolved oxygen (mg l^sup -1^), turbidity (ntu), temperature (<c2><b0>C), chlorophyll a concentration (chl a) (mg m^sup -3^), current speed (cm s^sup -1^), and direction (<c2><b0>). One pattern of gaping activity (P1) occurred from mid-July-early August-early November, whereas another pattern (P2) occurred the rest of the time (i.e., from early November-mid-July-early August). The activity was synchronized among the fan mussels and showed autocorrelation peaks at a period of 21.9-24 h. In P1, the fan mussels opened their valves according to the position and illumination of the sun and moon. In P2, however, individuals did not track sun and moonlight, although their gaping activity was regular and synchronized. Likewise, individuals were unaffected by high-frequency (daily) variation in dissolved oxygen and (chl a). Gaping activity was directly influenced by current intensity and direction. The shift between the two patterns and the presence of similar periods of autocorrelation in the activity time series indicate that P. nobilis has an internal clock.},

All populations studied had a high prevalence of the parasitic morph of the oligochaete worm, Chaetogaster limnaei. This worm was also found to infect two native snails, Glyptophysa gibbosa and Austropeplea tomentosa, at lower prevalences. Seasonality and collection sites did not significantly influence the worm's infection dynamics, but strong positive correlations were found between the sizes of P. acuta individuals and both the likelihood of infection and infection intensity. The ectocommensal morph of C. limnaei was found in all three pulmonate species. Physa acuta was infected with two digenean trematode species which were also found in two native snails, Posticobia brazieri and G. gibbosa. One digenean, found within the renal gland of P. acuta, did not significantly influence the presence or infection intensity of the renal gland-dwelling C. limnaei parasitic morph. All parasites infecting P. acuta were also found to be infecting sympatric native freshwater snails. The effects that such host sharing by parasites may have upon the establishment of P. acuta as a successful invader merit further study.},

abstract={The sedentarism and wide global distribution of the blue mussel Mytilus edulis have made it a useful bioindicator to assess changes in the health status of the marine ecosystem in response to pollution and other environmental stresses. Effective biomonitoring of an ecosystem requires, however, that multiple biomarkers be used to obtain an accurate measure of the cumulative effects of different sources of environmental stress. Here, we provide a first integrated review of the biological, economical, and geographical characteristics of another species of mussels, the ribbed mussel Aulacomya ater. We discuss the use of Aulacomya ater as a complementary biomonitor to the blue mussel to assess the impact of pollutants and climate change. Recent findings have indeed shown that Mytilus edulis and Aulacomya ater have distinctive anatomy and physiology and respond differently to environmental stress. Monitoring of mixed beds containing blue and ribbed mussels may thus represent a unique opportunity to study the effect of environmental stress on the biodiversity of marine ecosystems, most notably in the Southern hemisphere, which is particularly sensitive to climate change and where both species often cohabitate in the same intertidal zones.},

It is presumed that these processes result in significant change of physicochemical indicators of aquatic medium.

abstract={The study of the joint effect of multiple anthropogenic stressors is important because the emerging consequences are often unpredictable on the basis of knowledge of single effects. We explored the joint impact of glyphosate and the invasive golden mussel Limnoperna fortunei on freshwater phytoplankton, bacterioplankton and periphyton, and on the physical and chemical properties of the water. We manipulated both stressors simultaneously in a 25-day experiment using outdoor mesocosms; we assayed technical-grade glyphosate acid at four concentrations: 0, 1, 3 and 6 mg gly L^sup -1^ under scenarios with and without mussels. The addition of the glyphosate significantly increased total phosphorus according to the concentration used; the high clearance rate of L. fortunei significantly decreased phytoplanktonic abundance leading to low values of turbidity. The mussel significantly stimulated the development of filamentous green algae (metaphyton). Interestingly, the combined effect revealed that L. fortunei accelerated the dissipation of glyphosate, which showed a 4-fold decrease in its half-life; this promoted the rapid bioavailability of glyphosate-derived phosphorus in the water. The interaction had a synergistic effect on soluble reactive phosphorus concentrations and was directly dependent on the concentration of glyphosate. A synergistic effect was also observed on bacterioplankton, water turbidity and metaphyton, thus inducing enhanced and rapid eutrophication. The ability of mussels to reduce glyphosate in water may be valued as positive, but our results allow us to predict that the invasion of Limnoperna fortunei in natural freshwater systems contaminated by glyphosate will accelerate the negative impact of the herbicide associated with eutrophication.},

abstract={The stock of European Eel (Anguilla anguilla L.) has reached an all-time low in 2011. Spawner quality of mature eels in terms of health status and fitness is considered one of the key elements for successful migration and reproduction. Dioxin-like Polychlorinated Biphenyls (dl-PCBs) are known persistent organic pollutants potentially affecting the reproductive capability and health status of eels throughout their entire lifetime. In this study, muscle tissue samples of 192 European eels of all continental life stages from 6 different water bodies and 13 sampling sites were analyzed for contamination with lipophilic dl-PCBs to investigate the potential relevance of the respective habitat in light of eel stock management. Results of this study reveal habitat-dependent and life history stage-related accumulation of targeted PCBs. Sum concentrations of targeted PCBs differed significantly between life stages and inter-habitat variability in dl-PCB levels and -profiles was observed. Among all investigated life stages, migrant silver eels were found to be the most suitable life history stage to represent their particular water system due to habitat dwell-time and their terminal contamination status. With reference to a possible negative impact of dl-PCBs on health and the reproductive capability of eels, it was hypothesized that those growing up in less polluted habitats have a better chance to produce healthy offspring than those growing up in highly polluted habitats. We suggest that the contamination status of water systems is fundamental for the life cycle of eels and needs to be considered in stock management and restocking programs.},

Some species -- Brachycentrus subnubilus and Lepidostoma hirtum -- disappeared from the dredged parts of the river, but significantly more appeared, and these were typical river species. This replacement of species can be linked to habitat changes and the uncovering of larger patches of sandy bottom. The recolonizing species included accidental (eurytopic) species, which is typical in ecological succession for periods immediately following disturbances. On balance, despite the replacement of species, there was no decrease in species diversity, and typical river species appeared in larger numbers. In Trichoptera, recolonization following dredging first takes place as a result of drift of larvae, and then via dispersion of adults.},

Individuals of the intermediate 100-200 mm length had a variable diet, changing depending on the season; in spring they mostly preyed on Macoma balthica, in summer - on polychaetes, while in autumn the contribution of Mytilus trossulus and fish considerably increased in their diet. Diet composition of individuals <e2><89><a5> 200 mm was relatively constant in the course of the study with substantial preference to M. balthica.

title={Dietary Reliance on Benthic Primary Production as a Predictor of Mercury Accumulation in Freshwater Fish and Turtles},
abstract={The feeding ecology of a species can affect the transfer and accumulation of contaminants such as mercury (Hg). Modeling the accumulation of Hg through food webs can help identify which animals are likely to be burdened by elevated Hg concentrations. In lakes, most of the Hg is sequestered in the sediments. Therefore, species ultimately relying on benthic primary production may experience a greater trophic transfer of Hg relative to species that rely on pelagic primary production. This hypothesis was tested in a simple food web using muscle tissue collected from three species of fish (Lepomis gibbosus, Notropis heterodon, and Labidesthes sicculus) and blood from two species of turtles (Sternotherus odoratus and Chrysemys picta) that differ in reliance on benthic primary production. Averaged multiple linear regression models were used to predict Hg concentrations in the five consumers with respect to reliance on benthic primary production, while controlling for other factors known to influence Hg accumulation (sex, size, lake, species identity, and trophic level). A positive and significant relationship was found between Hg burden and dietary reliance on benthic primary production, animal length, trophic level, and species identity in fish. In turtles, the relationship between Hg burden and dietary reliance on benthic primary production was not significant, but trophic level, animal length, and species identity significantly influenced Hg burden. Overall, reliance on benthic primary production was an important predictor of Hg burden for fish, but not for turtles. Future attempts to model Hg accumulation in similar study systems and/or fish species should include dietary reliance on benthic primary production as a predictor variable.},

L. wollei and its epiphytes constituted 36 and 24%, respectively, of the in situ diet of G. fasciatus, whereas chlorophytes, macrophytes, and associated epiphytes represented a less important fraction of its diet. Benthic cyanobacterial mats should be considered a good shelter and food source for small omnivorous invertebrates such as amphipods.},

More and larger burbot larvae were found in the St. Clair River than in the lower Detroit River, although this may be due to differences in sampling methods between the two rivers. Consistent with existing studies, larval burbot exhibited ontogenesis with a distinct transition from a pelagic zooplankton-based diet to a benthic macroinvertebrate-based diet.

The purpose of this study was to investigate differences in the bioaccumulation of metals in three mussel species during and after dredging operations. Mussels were caged for approximately 1 year during dredging and after, and then mussel condition index values and As, Cd, Cr, Pb, Ni, Se, Hg, U, Fe, Mg, Al, Sb, Ba, Be, Co, Cu, Mn, Mo, Ag, Sr, Tl, V, and Zn concentrations in soft tissue were determined via inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometery. Overall, the differences observed in metal bioaccumulation and mussel health suggest that mussels in the immediate downstream area of the dredging site may have been impacted, as evidenced by a significant decrease in mussel condition index values, but that this impact did not result in increased tissue concentrations of metals.},

title={Modelling dynamic ecosystems: venturing beyond boundaries with the Ecopath approach},
abstract={Thirty years of progress using the Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) approach in different fields such as ecosystem impacts of fishing and climate change, emergent ecosystem dynamics, ecosystem-based management, and marine conservation and spatial planning were showcased November 2014 at the conference "Ecopath 30 years-modelling dynamic ecosystems: beyond boundaries with EwE". Exciting new developments include temporal-spatial and end-to-end modelling, as well as novel applications to environmental impact analyses, in both aquatic and terrestrial domains. A wide range of plug-ins have been added to extend the diagnostic capabilities of EwE, and the scientific community is applying EwE to a diversified range of topics besides fishing impact assessments, such as the development of scientific advice for management, the analysis of conservation issues, and the evaluation of cumulative impacts of environmental and human activities in marine food webs (including habitat modification and the invasion of alien species). Especially promising is the new potential to include the EwE model in integrated assessments with other models such as those related to climate change research. However, there are still many challenges, including the communication of scientific results in management procedures. In addition, other important scientific issues are how to improve model result validation and perform model quality control. During the conference, the Ecopath International Research and Development Consortium was presented as a way for the EwE user community to become involved in the long-term sustainability of the EwE approach. Overall, exciting times are facing the ecosystem modelling scientific community, and as illustrated by the conference: synergistic cooperation is the future path for the EwE approach.},

title={Ontogenetic changes in isotopic signatures of an omnivorous fish Cultrichthys erythropterus in East Lake Taihu, China},
abstract={The relationship between body size and stable isotopic signatures of the omnivorous Redfin Culter (Cultrichthys erythropterus), commonly found in East Lake Taihu, was investigated. Previous analyses of C. erythropterus stomach contents have shown that this species undergoes a diet switch from being predominantly zooplanktivorous to piscivorous during its life history. This was confirmed by stable carbon isotopic signature (<ce><b4>^sup 13^C) in this study, in which <ce><b4>^sup 13^C was positively correlated with both standard length and weight. The importance of littoral-benthic resources in supporting C. erythropterus during its lifespan was also demonstrated using a two-source mixing model, the results of which showed a significant increasing trend in the contribution of littoral-benthic energy. However, the stable nitrogen isotopic signature (<ce><b4>^sup 15^N) exhibited an unusual pattern compared with previous studies. The <ce><b4>^sup 15^N of C. erythropterus showed no relationship with body size, even though dietary changes were observed. This indicated that <ce><b4>^sup 15^N alone cannot fully reflect a diet shift in a species and possible variability in isotopic signatures over its life history. This should be considered when using stable isotopic signatures to investigate intra-specific variations and the timing of life-history events, such as estimating the trophic positions of fish species.},

abstract={We used bioenergetics models to investigate temperature effects induced by climate change on the growth and consumption by Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, lake trout Salvelinus namaycush, and steelhead O. mykiss in Lakes Michigan and Huron. We updated biological inputs to account for recent changes in the food webs and used temperature inputs in response to regional climate observed in the baseline period (1964-1993) and projected in the future period (2043-2070). Bioenergetics simulations were run across multiple age-classes and across all four seasons in different scenarios of prey availability. Due to the increased capacity of prey consumption, future growth and consumption by these salmonines were projected to increase substantially when prey availability was not limited. When prey consumption remained constant, future growth of these salmonines was projected to decrease in most cases but increase in some cases where the increase in metabolic cost can be compensated by the decrease in waste (egestion and excretion) loss. Consumption by these salmonines was projected to increase the most during spring and fall when prey energy densities are relatively high. Such seasonality benefits their future growth through increasing annual gross energy intake. Our results indicated that lake trout and steelhead would be better adapted to the warming climate than Chinook salmon. To maintain baseline growth into the future, an increase of 10 % in baseline prey consumption was required for Chinook salmon but considerably smaller increases, or no increases, in prey consumption were needed by lake trout and steelhead.},

title={Length- and weight-dependent clearance rates of juvenile mussels (Mytilus edulis) on various planktonic prey items},
abstract={Filtration capacity and feeding behaviour has been intensely studied for adult mussels (Mytilus edulis), but less information is available for juvenile mussels (1.5-25 mm, <1 year), especially in natural sea water. The recent introduction of mussel seed collectors in the Netherlands prompted the need for more detailed information on juvenile mussel behaviour. To estimate the impact of juvenile populations on ecosystem carrying capacity, information on clearance rate as well as usage of different prey items is essential. Clearance rates were measured in an experimental study, incubating juvenile mussels in natural sea water. Rates were related to isometrics as well as specified for the prey items bacteria, picophytoplankton (<3 [mu]m), nanophytoplankton (3-20 [mu]m), and ciliates. Results showed that the clearance rate of juvenile mussels depends on shell length^sup 2^, while the relationship between clearance rate and weight was more variable. Length is thus a better parameter for estimating clearance rate than weight. Ciliates and nanophytoplankton were cleared at comparable, but variable rates, while picoalgae were cleared from the water at the rate of 11-64 % compared to nanophytoplankton. For bacteria, the clearance rate was on average 9 %. This study showed different retention of particles of similar size (picoalgae and bacteria) as well as variability in particle retention for the different prey items. This variable retention efficiency could not be related to seston concentration nor to dominance in cell size. The results from this study can be used to estimate the effect of mussel seed collectors on the carrying capacity of the Dutch Wadden Sea.},

Kinetic and concentration-response experiments were performed measuring in the exposed mussel the activities of three molecular biomarkers: glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE). The long term (30 days) exposure of mussels to all concentrations (2-15 <c2><b5>g L^sup -1^) of BDE-47 significantly inhibited the AChE and GST activities, a result that supports the suitability of these biomarkers in marine pollution monitoring programs.

title={From the laboratory to the wild: salinity-based genetic differentiation of the European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) using gene-associated and gene-independent microsatellite markers},
abstract={Convincing evidence reporting adaptive variation for physiologically and/or ecologically important traits in marine taxa is often derived from studies comparing field and laboratory observations and based on candidate-gene markers, mainly allozymes, responding to habitat selection. Likewise, patterns of genetic differentiation between sea and lagoon populations of the euryhaline European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) were shown to correlate with changes in allele frequencies recorded during experimental salinity challenges, suggesting potential role for local adaptation. However, there has been criticism of these past approaches, causing a need for further investigation. We reinvestigated this correlation in European sea bass using a set of 20 micro- and one minisatellite markers, some of which are associated with candidate genes. We used rigorous experimental settings to demonstrate that only one single gene-associated marker consistently reported significant genetic differentiation between fish raised in seawater compared to fish acclimated to freshwater (locus EIF3E; F ^sub ST^ = 0.060; p = 0.007, n = 268). A few other loci were shown to be false positive and did not respond to selection. Furthermore, a field study of sea-lagoon differentiation in wild European sea bass (n = 144) using the same loci reported marginally significant genetic differentiation at locus EIF3E (F ^sub ST^ = 0.0114, p = 0.068). This locus was identified as putatively under selection. Two other microsatellite loci associated with genes (DLA0070 and DLA0060, respectively) were found to significantly participate to sea-lagoon differentiation and deviate from neutral expectation. The evidence for sea-lagoon local adaptation in sea bass remains faint if not highly elusive.},

Three assemblages were identified: group 1, present in sediments that contain a high percentage of silt-clay, small median particle size and high organic matter content and located at the most external areas of both bays and in the central basin of Alfacs Bay; group 2, present in the shallow northern platform in Alfacs Bay and in both platforms in Fangar Bay, the locations which feature highly variable sediment characteristics; and group 3, present in the shallow areas of both bays, which are characterised by low silt-clay and organic matter content. In Alfacs Bay, the differentiation of these assemblages has persisted since 1987, independently of the increase in organic matter content and heavy metal concentrations and of the shift in macrofaunal composition that have occurred over the past 20 years, most likely the result of increased agricultural activity.},

abstract={Abalone (Haliotis) are economically important molluscs for fisheries and aquaculture industries worldwide. Despite this, genomic resources for abalone and molluscs are still limited. Here we present a description and functional annotation of the greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata) transcriptome. We present a focused analysis on the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) family of genes with putative functions affecting temperature stress and immunity. A total of ~38 million paired end Illumina reads were obtained, resulting in a Trinity assembly of 222,172 contigs with minimum length of 200 base pairs and maximum length of 33 kilobases. The 20,702 contigs were annotated with gene descriptions by BLAST. We created a program to maximise the number of functionally annotated genes, and over 10,000 contigs were assigned Gene ontologies (GO terms). By using CateGOrizer, immunity related GO terms for stressors such as heat, hypoxia, oxidative stress and wounding received the highest counts. Twenty-six contigs with homology to the HSP70 family of genes were identified. Ninety-one putative single-nucleotide polymorphisms were observed in the abalone HSP70 contigs. Eleven of these were considered non-synonymous. The annotated transcriptome described in this study will be a useful basis for future work investigating the genetic response of abalone to stress.},

abstract={We describe for the first time the distribution and abundance of Oculina patagonica along the coasts of the Northern Albor<c3><a1>n Sea (Andalusia Region, Southern Iberian Peninsula), which corresponds to the southernmost region of the known distribution range of the coral. After surveying 693 km of the Andalusia coastline, along three different depths, we showed that O. patagonica was restricted to the eastern shores of the Albor<c3><a1>n Sea. It was only present in 7 out of 195 sampling stations in the eastern region along the studied coasts and at the depth range of 0-3 m. Moreover, we observed that the distribution of the species along the northern coasts of the Albor<c3><a1>n Sea might be related to substrate availability and sea surface temperature. In the localities in which its presence was described, the annual mean sea water temperature was in the range of 18-21<c2><b0>C. In relation to substrate availability, it must be noted that the distribution of hard substrata - ideal for O. patagonica settlement and growth - along the sampling area, is not uniform in the study area; this might affect the continuity of the distribution of the species. Local studies such as this one are of importance as a starting point for delineating the species' relationship with its habitat, population boundaries and population ecology. Given the fast expansion of this species along the Mediterranean coasts, this study could serve as a basis for continuous monitoring of the spread of the species and its long-term effects on the ecosystem.},

abstract={Issue Title: Including a Special Feature on Unravelling ecological networks: complexity-stability relations and diversity of interaction types Resident natural enemies can impact invasive species by causing Allee effects, leading to a reduction in establishment success of small founder populations, or by regulating or merely suppressing the abundance of established populations. Epiphyas postvittana, the Light Brown Apple Moth, an invasive leafroller in California, has been found to be attacked by a large assemblage of resident parasitoids that cause relatively high rates of parasitism. Over a 4-year period, we measured the abundance and per capita growth rates of four E. postvittana populations in California and determined parasitism rates. We found that at two of the sites, parasitism caused a component Allee effect, a reduction in individual survivorship at lower E. postvittana population densities, although it did not translate into a demographic Allee effect, an impact on per capita population growth rates at low densities. Instead, E. postvittana populations at all four sites exhibited strong compensatory density feedback throughout the entire range of densities observed at each site. As we found no evidence for a negative relationship between per capita population growth rates and parasitism rates, we concluded that resident parasitoids were unable to regulate E. postvittana populations in California. Despite a lack of evidence for regulation or a demographic Allee effect, the impact of resident parasitoids on E. postvittana populations is substantial and demonstrates significant biotic resistance against this new invader.},

abstract={During drought periods, the razor clam Solen cylindraceus is the dominant bivalve in the St Lucia estuarine system, although restricted to its South Lake region. However, with the recent onset of a wet phase, the mussel Brachidontes virgiliae has become widespread and overwhelmingly dominant throughout the system. The salinity tolerance of B. virgiliae is here determined using both rapid and gradual changes in salinity. Mussels were collected at Esengeni in the Narrows (salinity [asymptotically =] 0) and Lister's Point in False Bay (salinity [asymptotically =] 20). Mortalities were recorded for animals exposed to a sudden change in salinity using 8 different treatments, ranging from 0 to 70. Additionally, animals were exposed to a gradual change in salinity, using treatments that exceeded the minimum and maximum salinities mussels were previously able to tolerate. In all four experiments, animals were able to tolerate salinity levels up to 20. However, a wider salinity tolerance, up to 50, was shown by animals collected from Lister's Point and those gradually acclimated to test conditions. With an increase in flood events predicted for this region, it is imperative to understand how key species may be affected. During wet phases B. virgiliae becomes ubiquitious throughout Lake St Lucia and it is unlikely that the species will disappear from the system, even if floods escalate in the future, as it has an ability to withstand near-freshwater conditions. During dry periods, however, the mussel will be concentrated in the Narrows (oligohaline to limnetic conditions), especially if an inverse salinity gradient with hypersaline conditions prevails within the system.},

However, environmental drivers of C and N dynamics in oyster biodeposits and reef-adjacent sediments require clarification. In July 2012, we collected intact sediment cores adjacent to and 15-20 m away from two oyster reefs (Crassostrea virginica) in Great Bay, New Hampshire, USA: one reference site and one site with cultural eutrophication. We also measured seston, chlorophyll a, and in situ oyster feeding and biodeposition. Cores were incubated in continuous-flow chambers where inflow water received ^sup 15^N-ammonium (NH^sub 4^ ^sup +^), ^sup 15^NO3 ^sup -^, or no isotopes (control). We quantified fluxes of dissolved nutrients and gasses (oxygen, ^sup 28^N2, ^sup 29^N2, ^sup 30^N2, and argon) after 24 h. Finally, we measured size-fractionated sediment organic matter. At the eutrophic site, abundant phytoplankton in the 5-28 <c2><b5>m size range was correlated with enhanced oyster feeding rates and biodeposit quality (lower C:N). This site had greater denitrification rates in reef-adjacent cores relative to distal cores. Low production of ^sup 29,30^N2 in ^sup 15^NH^sub 4^ ^sup +^ amended cores suggested water column or biodeposit NH^sub 4^ ^sup +^ were unlikely to be converted to N2. At both sites, reef-adjacent cores had more shell and higher ^sup 29,30^N2 production with ^sup 15^NO3 ^sup -^ addition relative to distal cores, suggesting direct denitrification enhancement near reefs. Oysters likely increased sediment N2 production via high quality biodeposits (eutrophic site), and NO3 ^sup -^ diffusion via structural complexity of reef-adjacent sediment (both sites).

Reclaimed water is a perishable product with a shelf life requiring packaging (i.e., piping) and preserving (with a disinfectant) during storage to minimize deterioration in quality. It typically contains higher nutrient levels compared to potable water. Based on an online survey, the challenges were characterized into nine categories in order of importance: infrastructure, water quality, customer relations, operational, cost (pricing), capacity/supply, regulation, workforce, and miscellaneous. The first five categories accounted for 80% of the challenges raised by the industry. A review of the literature provided various remedies to these challenges which can be incorporated into best management practices for controlling potential health and aesthetic issues associated with storage and distribution of reclaimed water.},

abstract={Issue Title: Challenges in Aquatic Sciences At least 30 species of nonindigenous freshwater snails have invaded North America. The risk of these snails invading new lakes depends upon their ability to survive overland transport. We first reviewed published laboratory experiments using freshwater snails, which show numerous species are able to tolerate days of air exposure. We then tested tolerance to drying of three species of invasive aquatic snails that are widespread in Wisconsin: Bithynia tentaculata, Cipangopaludina chinensis, and Viviparus georgianus. In a series of seven experiments, we simulated boater transport by placing snails individually in mesh bags, hung outdoors, and confined in a screen tent. The screen roof allowed exposure to both sun and rain, and an on-site weather station recorded temperature, precipitation, and humidity. All three species exhibited high survivorship, with some individuals alive at the end of most experiments: 42 days for B. tentaculata and V. georgianus and 63 days for C. chinensis. Viable young were released by C. chinensis after 54 days of exposure. Overall, our results indicate that these invasive snails should readily survive long periods of transport overland, indicating a need for continued vigilance of recreational boaters entering lakes.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={There are multiple stressors derived from urbanizations that result in frequent disturbances on streams and rivers reducing water quality and threatens aquatic biota. P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated multixenobiotic resistance (MXR) is a defence mechanism analogous to multidrug resistance (MDR), which has been demonstrated in several aquatic organisms. This system protects cells against the entry and the accumulation of xenobiotics and has been proposed as a biomarker for pollution assessment. We conducted a study in a post-urban reach of Esquel stream (Chubut Province) downstream a wastewater treatment plant, in order to assess the presence and activity of MXR in five freshwater macroinvertebrate species (Helobdella michaelseni, Helobdella simplex, Patagoniobdella variabilis, Hyalella curvispina and Chironomus riparius). We measured the accumulation of the model P-gp substrate rhodamine B (RB) in organisms previously exposed to pollution. Our results described the activity of the MXR system in the three species of leeches suggesting their suitability as the in vivo biomonitoring. We also identified a dependence of the transporter activity with the development stage in H. simplex, highlighting the importance of using organisms of similar size classes since it may affect observed results. Finally, we concluded that benthic freshwater macroinvertebrates possess different species-specific levels of MXR activity possibly influencing their natural distribution as well as their survival.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Wetland ecosystems maintain and improve water quality through the process of denitrification, an increasingly important ecosystem service due to global N pollution. Invasive plants have the potential to disrupt denitrification by altering the environmental conditions that facilitate this process. Great Lakes coastal wetlands are experiencing widespread invasion by highly productive hybrid cattail with largely uncertain biogeochemical effects. Through field and controlled mesocosm studies, we sought to determine the effects of cattail invasion through time on denitrification rates and associated environmental factors in a Great Lakes coastal wetland. In the field, we found that cattail density correlated with increased denitrification and a suite of environmental and plant community characteristics and denitrification rates were positively correlated with NH^sub 4^ ^sup +^, sediment organic matter, reduced water levels, and cattail stand age. Through our controlled mesocosm study, we documented conditions 1- and 5-year following invasion and found that denitrification rates and soil organic matter increased in year 5, and cattail and year-since-invasion altered plant communities and soil NH^sub 4^ ^sup +^. Only a weak correlation between denitrification rates and cattail treatments was noted, however, owing to high replicate variability. Our results indicate that with increasing cattail residence time, one ecosystem service, biodiversity, was negatively impacted, while two other services, denitrification and sediment carbon accumulation, were enhanced. Thus, this highly invaded wetland still provides valuable services to aquatic ecosystems and to society. A holistic perspective is therefore critical when evaluating invasive species impacts in which negative impacts are weighed against other ecosystem services, which may be stimulated.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

This study aims at extending the available information on the toxicity of these three emerging AF biocides to key marine invertebrates. Here we investigate the toxicity of tralopyril and capsaicin to the early life stages of the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis and the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus and also of tralopyril, capsaicin and TPBP to the early life stages of the copepod Tisbe battagliai. The EC^sub 50^ that causes abnormal development of mussel's D-veliger larvae and impairs the growth of sea urchin pluteus larvae are respectively 3.1 and 3.0<c2><a0>[mu]g/L for tralopyril and 3,868 and 5,248<c2><a0>[mu]g/L for capsaicin. Regarding the copepod T. battagliai, the LC^sub 50^ was 0.9<c2><a0>[mu]g/L for tralopyril, 1,252<c2><a0>[mu]g/L for capsaicin and 14<c2><a0>[mu]g/L for TPBP. The results obtained for the three substances are compared to a reference AF biocide, tributyltin (TBT), and their ecological risk evaluated. These compounds pose a lower environmental risk than TBT but still, our results suggest that tralopyril and TPBP may represent a considerable threat to the ecosystems.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Bivalves in a bottleneck: taxonomy, phylogeography and conservation of freshwater mussels (Bivalvia: Unionoida) in Australasia},
abstract={Issue Title: Biology and Conservation of Freshwater Bivalves The conservation biology of Australasian freshwater mussels is hindered by lack of a taxonomic framework that employs molecular data as a complement to shell characters, larval forms and internal anatomy. The fauna includes more than 32 known species (30+ Hyriidae, 2 Unionidae), but has not been revised for 55 years, despite minor amendments. The hyriids are relics of Gondwana, represented in Australia and New Guinea by the ancestral Velesunioninae and in Australia and New Zealand by the Hyriinae (Tribe Hyridellini). Many taxonomic and phylogeographic issues await resolution, including the relationships between Australasian and South American species, and between Australian and New Zealand species, and the status of species in New Guinea (including uncertain reports of Unionidae) and the Solomon Islands. Once these are clarified, it will be easier to identify threatened species and evaluate the conservation status of the fauna. At present, only seven taxa are named in the IUCN Red List or under national/state legislation, and these are not representative. Threatening processes include altered flow regimes, catchment disturbances, salinisation, pollution and invasive species. While the need for a taxonomic revision is paramount, progress in conservation may depend also upon involving the wider community.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Multixenobiotic Resistance Mechanism in Gills of Reared vs Wild Mediterranean Mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis},
abstract={Mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis (Lamarck, 1819)) is directly exposed to sea water contamination that elicits significant physiological and cellular response, although its extent mounted in aquaculture-reared in comparison to wild bivalve populations is scarcely known. Therefore, we have compared contamination biomarkers in mussels from reared (Marina farm) and wild, anthropogenically affected site (Vranjic Bay). While predictably, the levels of metals (Cu, Cd, Pb, Zn, Fe, and Hg) in whole bivalve tissues determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry resulted in significantly higher concentrations in wild mussels, accompanied by elevated number of apoptotic cells in gills, the activity of multixenobiotic resistance defense mechanism (MXR), measured as the accumulation rate of model substrate rhodamine B (RB) gave contrasting results. The functional RB assay evidenced a lower MXR efflux activity in the gill tissue of wild mussels, indicating two possible scenarios that will need further focus: 1. persisting sea water pollution increased cell damage of bivalve gill cells and consequently led to leakage of the RB into cytoplasm and dysfunctional MXR efflux in wild mussels, or/and 2. a mixture of different toxic compounds present in Vranjic Bay sea water induced oversaturation of MXR efflux, inducing elevated accumulation of the dye. Consequently, it seems that an efficient physiological functioning of MXR in wild mussels is strongly hampered by existence of an unknown quantity of sea water pollutants that may endanger intrinsic organismal defense system and lead toward the enhancement of toxicity.

title={Community structure of epiphytic algae on three different macrophytes at Acarlar floodplain forest (northern Turkey)},
abstract={The aim of this study was to determine the species composition, biodiversity and, relative abundance of epiphytic algae and their relationship with environmental variables on three different macrophytes (Nymphaea alba, Ceratophyllum demersum, Typha latifolia ) at Acarlar Floodplain Forest (AFF). Epiphytic algae were gathered monthly by collecting aquatic plants between November 2011 and October 2012, except in winter when there were no plants. In this study, 67 taxa on N. alba, 66 taxa on C. demersum and 66 taxa on T. latifolia were identified as epiphytic algae. The mean value of species richness was 17, that of diversity was 1.5 and that of evenness was 0.54 for epiphytic algae on N. alba, 17, 1.1, and 0.39 on C. demersum, and 18, 1.64, and 0.56 on T. latifolia, respectively. Oscillatoria sp. and Komvophoron crassum (Vozzen) Anagnostidis and Kom<c3><a1>rek were the most abundant and consistent epiphytic algal species, occurring in high abundance on all macrophytes. Results show that species composition of epiphytic algae was different, but diversity values were similar on all the macrophytes. The hydrological pulse is one of the most important factors determining the physical and chemical environment of the epiphytic algal community. However, substrate type also affected the colonization by F. capucina, O. sancta, P. catenata, and L. truncicola more than the epiphytic algal seasonality.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Predators influence the tidal distribution of oysters (Crassostrea virginica)},
abstract={Biotic and abiotic conditions can separately and synergistically influence the abundance and distribution of species and create vertical zonation patterns in marine systems. In Corpus Christi Bay, TX, USA, eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) are limited to intertidal habitats, while in adjacent estuaries, oysters not only grow subtidally, but thrive in these areas to the extent they are a viable commercial fishery. The purpose of this study was to assess how predators and abiotic conditions affect oyster mortality and growth at different tidal elevations. Anecdotal evidence suggests that abiotic conditions, primarily hypoxia and salinity, as well as oyster disease, limits oysters to intertidal areas. Yet, in Corpus Christi Bay, oysters are absent from subtidal areas where hypoxia is not known to occur. Infection by Perkinsus marinus (Dermo) is common in the study area, but previous work suggests that infection rates do not increase when oysters are transplanted subtidally. We investigated oyster tidal distributions by transplanting newly settled oysters into intertidal and subtidal areas. Predation on oysters was significantly greater in subtidal as compared to intertidal habitats. When protected from predators using cages, oyster survival significantly increased. Further, oysters in subtidal areas allocated significantly more resources to shell growth than did those in intertidal areas, and oysters are known to grow heavier shells in response to predators. Oyster settlement was not statistically different between inter and subtidal areas, and abiotic conditions measured during the study did not exceed known tolerance limits for oysters. Previous studies have shown that abiotic conditions influence oyster mortality and the success of restored oyster reefs. Our findings indicate that predators can also affect oyster distribution, and their effects should be evaluated when developing plans for oyster management and restoration.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Multiscale patterns of genetic structure in a marine snail (Solenosteira macrospira) without pelagic dispersal},
abstract={The northern Gulf of California (NGC) is one of the most dynamic and productive marine ecosystems in the world, yet knowledge about population connectivity and dispersal patterns is lacking for many of its resident species. Using nuclear and mitochondrial markers, we investigated the effects of open water, geographical distance and suitable habitat on patterns of genetic structure of Solenosteira macrospira, a benthic buccinid whelk with direct development. We collected samples in April 2004, 2005 and May 2007 from the upper NGC (31<c2><b0>34.39''N, 114<c2><b0>44.45''W). Phylogenetic analyses, hierarchical analyses of variance and Bayesian assignment tests substantiated a break between the east and west coasts. Genetic distance between population pairs increased with geographical distance, but only when assuming a U-shaped dispersal pathway over the open water of the NGC. Given S. macrospira's association with rocky intertidal habitats, and its limited dispersal potential, we assumed that the geographical distribution of rocky habitat would play a significant role in genetic differentiation of S. macrospira. Nevertheless, populations separated by sand were more similar than populations separated by rocks. The influence of open water, geographical distance and suitable habitat (rocks vs. sand) also varied significantly across different genetic markers that presumably evolve at different rates. Specifically, the more rapidly evolving nuclear microsatellites suggested that physical transport processes strongly influence genetic differentiation on contemporary time scales, even in a species with direct benthic development. This underscores the strong, and potentially homogenizing, effect of present-day ocean circulation patterns in the NGC.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Aim of this study was to describe the toxicity of a set of different commercially available silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) to the gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas putida (growth inhibition assay, ISO 10712) in order to contribute to their environmental hazard and risk assessment. Different AgNP sizes and coatings were selected in order to analyze whether those characteristics are determinants of nanoparticle toxicity. Silver nitrate was tested for comparison. In general Pseudomonas putida reacted very sensitive towards the exposure to silver, with an EC^sub 05^ value of 0.043<c2><a0>[mu]g L^sup -1^ for AgNO3 and between 0.13 and 3.41<c2><a0>[mu]g L^sup -1^ for the different AgNPs (EC^sub 50^ values 0.16<c2><a0>[mu]g L^sup -1^ for AgNO3, resp. between 0.25 and 13.4<c2><a0>[mu]g L^sup -1^ for AgNPs). As the ionic form of silver is clearly the most toxic, an environmental hazard assessment for microorganisms based on total silver concentration and the assumption that AgNPs dissolve is sufficiently protective. Neither specific coatings nor certain sizes could be linked to increasing or decreasing toxicity. The characterization of particle behavior as well as the total and dissolved silver content in the medium during the exposures was not possible due to the high sensitivity of Pseudomonas (test concentrations were below detection limits), indicating the need for further development in the analytical domain. Monitored silver concentrations in the aquatic environment span six orders of magnitude (0.1-120,000 ng L^sup -1^), which falls into the span of observed EC^sub 05^ values and might hence indicate a risk to environmental bacteria.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Role of Invasive Green Crabs in the Food Web of an Intertidal Sand Flat Determined from Field Observations and a Dynamic Simulation Model},
abstract={A benthic focussed food web model of intermediate complexity was developed for the intertidal sand flat in the Kejimkujik National Park Seaside, NS, Canada. The goal was to understand the role of invasive green crabs and to investigate potential effects of its removal on the ecosystem. Inputs of biomass, production, consumption and diet composition for each model compartment were obtained through targeted field collections in summers 2008-2010. Simulation (via Ecosim) was used to develop a data-driven baseline steady-state food web of summer conditions and to evaluate effects of ecosystem perturbations that included moderate and extreme removal of crab biomass, in the presence and absence of migrating shorebirds. In the baseline model, green crabs were important benthic predators and also prey for fishes and birds. Ecosystem properties (e.g. size, energetics, organisation) suggested a stable ecosystem. Scenario analyses predicted that crab removal caused only slight perturbations to overall ecosystem properties, but affected some trophic components. Predators that consumed mainly crabs (e.g. gulls) decreased in biomass with crab removal because diet changes could not compensate for lost crab prey. Predators that consumed crabs and also other prey (e.g. plovers) increased in biomass with crab removal because shared benthic prey increased. Migrating shorebirds had a greater impact on the food web than crab removal. Our study suggests that removal of invasive green crabs will likely not drastically change food web biomass and productivity. This study illustrates how field data can be synthesised with food web models for effective management of coastal ecosystems.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Topical advances and recent studies in paleolimnological research},
abstract={Paleolimnology combines the disciplines of limnology, geology and ecology, but because of challenges that separate investigators from direct knowledge about past lake conditions, the field is multidisciplinary by necessity. As a result, paleolimnology is influenced continuously by advances in many disciplines. As with limnological studies in recent decades, paleolimnology has diverged largely from the ecological and theoretical focuses of early investigators, but recent studies demonstrate the need for more integration of ecological and paleolimnological research. This paper provides a brief overview of recent paleolimnological investigations that have addressed questions related to theoretical ecology, as well as applied lake-management and climate research issues. We examine the use of transfer function models for estimating past water-quality conditions, and important caveats expressed by investigators about limitations in the development and use of such models. Paleolimnological research has contributed new insights about biological, physical and chemical processes in lakes that have been subject to change because of climate drivers and anthropogenic influences. These findings are relevant to predicting how lakes will respond to climate change, and will require new management approaches in the future. As the range of paleolimnological studies expands, there will be greater need for basic limnological research in order for paleolimnological investigators to better understand how sediments reflect lake processes of those regions.},

title={Effect of prey richness on a consumer's intrinsic growth rate},
abstract={The intrinsic growth rate of non-selective microbivores increases asymptotically with increasing prey biomass, but we do not know how intrinsic growth rate is affected by prey richness. The objective of this experiment was to determine the effect of prey richness on the growth kinetics of nematode predators while grazing on mixed bacterial lawns. We found that the intrinsic growth rate of Caenorhabditis elegans in laboratory culture increased asymptotically with prey richness. The mechanism of this pattern was primarily due to the best available prey species in the mixture: the intrinsic growth rate of the consumer feeding on a mixture of prey was approximately equal to the intrinsic growth rate of the predator when feeding on the single best prey in monoculture. This was analogous to the selection effect observed in biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships. Generation time, and not reproductive output, was the life history trait component that was most consistent with the pattern of intrinsic growth rate. Our results suggest that in order to link invertebrate consumers' growth rates to their microbial species composition in the field, it will be necessary to determine the ability of microbivorous invertebrates to selectively forage in natural environments and to better understand the micro-scale distribution of microbial communities in their natural environments.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Contrasting energy pathways at the community level as a consequence of regime shifts},
abstract={Ecological regime shifts typically result in abrupt changes in ecosystem structure through several trophic levels, which leads to rapid ecosystem reconfiguration between regimes. An interesting aspect of the impact of regime shift is that alternative regimes may induce distinct shifts in energy pathways; these have been less tested than structural changes. This paper addresses this by using stable isotopes to establish the energy pathways in fish communities. We specifically focus on the impact of regime shift on changes of the energy pathways, and how the magnitude and direction of these changes affect the local community. We found that energy pathways significantly varied among the planktivorous, benthivorous, and piscivorous trophic guilds as a result of the alternative regimes. The regime shift from a clear to a turbid state altered the food web towards planktonic energy pathways and truncated food chain length, which is indicative of less ecological efficiency. This was confirmed by the adaptive foraging strategies of prevalent omnivores in the current communities. These structural and functional characteristics of trophic interactions might not facilitate classic trophic cascading effects in such a turbid regime and suppress the system's response to environmental changes, e.g., nutrient loading, and restoration efforts in turbid to clear water regime shifts.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={We investigated trophic relationships involving microzooplankton in the low salinity zone of the San Francisco Estuary (SFE) as part of a larger effort aimed at understanding the dynamics of the food web supporting the endangered delta smelt, Hypomesus transpacificus. We performed 14 cascade experiments in which we manipulated the biomass of a copepod (Limnoithona tetraspina, Pseudodiaptomus forbesi, or Acartiella sinensis) and quantified responses of lower trophic levels including bacterioplankton, phytoplankton, and microzooplankton. Microzooplankton comprised a major food source for copepods; 9 out of 14 experiments showed removal of at least one group of microzooplankton by copepods. In contrast, the impact of copepods on phytoplankton was indirect; increased copepod biomass led to greater growth of phytoplankton in 3 of 14 experiments. Estimated clearance rates on microzooplankton were 4 mL day^sup -1^ for L. tetraspina and 2-6 mL day^sup -1^ for P. forbesi, whereas A. sinensis consumed mainly copepod nauplii. Complex trophic interactions, including omnivory, among copepods, microzooplankton, and different components of the phytoplankton likely obscured clear trends. The food web of the SFE is probably less efficient than previously thought, providing poor support to higher trophic levels; this inefficient food web is almost certainly implicated in the continuing low abundance of fishes, including the delta smelt that use the low salinity zone of the San Francisco Estuary.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Urbanization can considerably affect water reservoirs by, inter alia, input, and accumulation of contaminants including metals. Located in the course of River Cybina, Maltaski Reservoir (Western Poland) is an artificial shallow water body built for recreation and sport purposes which undergoes restoration treatment (drainage) every 4 years. In the present study, we demonstrate an accumulation of nine metals (Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn) in water, sediment, three bivalve species (Anodonta anatina, Anodonta cygnea, Unio tumidus), and macrophyte Phragmites australis collected before complete drainage in November 2012. The mean concentrations of metals in the sediment, bivalves, and P. australis (roots and leaves) decreased in the following order: Fe > Mn > Zn > Cu > Cr > Ni > Pb > Co > Cd. A considerably higher bioconcentration of metals was observed in samples collected from the western and southern sites which undergo a higher degree of human impact. Sediments were found to be a better indicator of metal contamination than water samples. Interspecific differences in levels of metal accumulation were found between investigated unionids. U. tumidus accumulated higher levels of Cr, positively correlated with ambient concentrations, predisposing this species as a potential bioindicator of this metal in aquatic environments. On the other hand, species of Anodonta genus demonstrated higher accumulation of Cu and Cd. Positive correlations were found between Pb content in the sediments and tissues of all three bivalve species. In P. australis, metals were largely retained in roots except for Cd and Pb for which higher concentrations were found in leaves suggesting additional absorption of these metals from aerial sources. P. australis and bivalve from the Maltaski Reservoir may be a potential source of toxic metals for animals feeding upon them and contribute to further contamination in the food chain.

Early applications were focused on harmful algal blooms, but more recently methods have been developed to interrogate the ocean for bacteria. As satellite-based sensors have become more sophisticated and our ability to interpret information derived from these sensors has advanced, we have progressed from merely making fascinating pictures from space to developing process models with predictive capability. Our understanding of the role of marine microorganisms in primary production and global elemental cycles has been vastly improved as has our ability to use the combination of remote sensing data and models to provide early warning systems for disease outbreaks. This manuscript will discuss current approaches to monitoring cyanobacteria and vibrios, their activity and response to environmental drivers, and will also suggest future directions.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Differences in dispersal- and colonization-related traits between taxa from the freshwater and the terrestrial realm},
abstract={The aquatic and terrestrial realms differ in many physical properties that not only require specific physiological adaptations but also cause differences in dispersal options. We thus expect that life-history traits related to dispersal and colonization are under selection pressure because freshwater habitats are more isolated and thus more difficult to reach. We compared traits from European databases of three taxonomic groups along the passive-active dispersal gradient: plants (Plantes), snails (Mollusca: Gastropoda: Prosobranchia et Pulmonata) and hoverflies (Diptera: Syrphidae), all of which have both terrestrial and freshwater species (plants and snails) or early life stages (hoverflies). Aquatic taxa seem to be more successful long-distance dispersers than are terrestrial taxa. Our analysis also revealed lower numbers of seeds or eggs produced in the aquatic habitats. However, aquatic taxa often allocate resources to offspring guarding (vegetative propagules in plants, egg capsules in snails) and breeding-site selection (syrphids). Colonization of the aquatic realm is reinforced by increases in life span (plants), clonal spread (plants), shorter generation times (snails), selfing ability (marginal effect in pulmonate snails) or paedogenesis (two incidences in hoverflies, needs further studies). Probably, the variety of strategies reflects the different evolutionary backgrounds that elicit different combinations of trade-offs, but all traits also might increase invasibility of species.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Biota as toxic metal indicators},
abstract={Metal in the environment arises from both natural sources and human activities. Toxic metals in air, soil, and water have become a global problem. They are potential hazards to aquatic, animal, and human life because of their toxicity, bioaccumulative, and non-biodegradable nature. The major impacts of metal pollutants can be stated as ecosystem contamination and health problems of exposed human populations. Those problems have been a cause of increasing public concern throughout the world. Some trace metals are used by living organisms to stabilize protein structures, facilitate electron transfer reactions, and catalyze enzymatic reactions. But even metals that are biologically essential can be harmful to living organisms at high levels of exposure. An increasing concentration of heavy metals in the environment can modify mineral and enzyme functions of human beings. During the last two decades, the interest in using bioindicators as monitoring tools to assess environmental pollution with toxic metals has increased. Bioindicators are flora and fauna members, which are collected and analyzed to measure the levels of metal contaminants. Bioindicators therefore identify health hazards. Various living organisms, such as microbes, fungi, plants, animals, and humans, are used to monitor toxic metals from air, water, sediment, soil, and food chain. Here, we review recent bioindicators, toxicity assessment, and ecological effects.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={The utility of early effect endpoints as biomarkers of ecotoxicity of natural sediments in water-sediment static system was investigated. The particular goal was to evaluate the ecotoxicity of the sediment samples from La Choza stream, located in upper basin of the Reconquista river, the second most polluted river of Argentina. Native juveniles Hyalella curvispina were used as test organisms evaluating survival, growth, oxidative stress parameters (SOD; CAT, TBARS) and the electron transport system (ETS) activity as early toxic effect. This study used methodologies and techniques that allow the assessment of sediment pollution with a native species as test organism and provided data to discuss the viability of sublethal endpoints as tools for freshwater sediment assessment. In spring and in summer two ten-day series of whole-sediment assays were conducted simultaneously: (a) standard assays and (b) biomarkers assays. A control sediment was ran simultaneously in which no--effect on survival was measured. In summer there was a significant increase in length and biomass in both exposed and control groups. In spring an inhibitory effect on growth and an increase in oxidative damage with a concomitant rise in antioxidant defenses, was observed in animals exposed to La Choza sediment. ETS measurement indicated a significant depression of metabolic activity of amphipods exposed to contaminated sediments. The measured biomarkers represent the first record for juvenile H. curvispina exposed to polluted natural sediments under standardized laboratory conditions. The used bioanalytical tools demonstrated higher sensitivity and a more accurate assessment of the effects than those obtained by the standard tests of survival and growth. We propose their adoption in biomonitoring of freshwater sediment toxicity.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Temporal distribution of pollutants was also investigated over restricted survey ponds sampled three times round year 2007. Sedentary pond Prussian carp juveniles were also captured to determine their brain aromatase activity (AA) and plasma vitellogenin (VTG) levels. Heavy metal distribution was also examined in various pond matrices. Amongst the pesticides analysed, only herbicides were detected. Contamination of pond water by atrazine was frequently observed during spring 2004, while isoproturon and glyphosate were detected round year 2007. Levels of herbicides were inversely related to the distance of ponds to crop field, and values peaked in April or October. Absence of endocrine disruptors in pond water was confirmed by lack of modulation in VTG and AA in male fish. Heavy metals were present in all the pond matrices, but overall contamination levels were low. The results demonstrated that Belgian ponds were mainly contaminated by herbicides and that pond sedentary fish were not affected by endocrine disruptors. They also demonstrated a marked effect of land-use intensity on herbicide pollution which can be mitigated by an adjustment of the buffer zones.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT] Erratum DOI: 10.1007/s10750-013-1689-0},

abstract={Lake Poyang is the largest freshwater lake in China and contains unique and diverse biota within the Yangtze floodplain ecosystem. However, knowledge of its macrozoobenthic assemblages remains inadequate. To characterize the current community structure of these assemblages and to portray their decadal changes, quarterly investigations were conducted at 15 sites from February to November 2012. A total of 42 taxa were recorded, and Corbicula fluminea, Limnoperna fortunei, Gammaridae sp., Nephtys polybranchia, Polypedilum scalaenum and Branchiura sowerbyi were found to dominate the community in terms of abundance. The bivalves Corbicula fluminea, Lamprotula rochechouarti, Arconaia lanceolata and Lamprotula caveata dominated the community in biomass due to their large body size. The mean abundance of the total macrozoobenthos varied from 48 to 920 ind<c2><b7>m-2, the mean biomass ranged from 28 to 428 g<c2><b7>m-2. The substrate type affected strongly the abundance, biomass, and diversity of the macrozoobenthos, with muddy sand substrates showing the highest values. Compared with historical data, remarkable changes were observed in the abundance of macrozoobenthos and the identity of the dominant species. The mean total abundance decreased from 724 ind<c2><b7>m-2 in 1992 to 228 ind<c2><b7>m-2 in 2012. The dominant species have shifted dramatically. Large unionids were dominant before 1998, whereas pollution-tolerant species (e.g., Branchiura sowerbyi) increased in dominance after 2008.

title={Nuisance species: beyond the ecological perspective},
abstract={'Nuisance species' (or 'invasive' species) are often proposed to be the second most important concern in the context of the current biodiversity crisis. Despite increasing evidence that exotic species do not always become invasive, this perception is still common in the scientific community. This suggests that other issues are at stake in the concept of nuisance species rather than just the problems they raise, grounded mostly in ecological or economic arguments. We retraced the evolution of pigeon representation in France through an extensive review of ancient texts related to pigeons and reviewed more than 240 source texts, dating from the seventh century to the 1990s. We completed these data with literature on human-animal relationships and animal conceptions in religious, philosophical, scientific, and political currents of thought that were representative of Western and, specifically, French tradition. We used the heated debate over pigeons (Columba livia) as pests as a case study by analyzing the ecological, social, economic, and political relations regarding pigeons. Through a historical perspective of the debate about and understanding of pigeons, we propose a new and complementary explanation for the modern thinking of pigeons as a nuisance species, based on what we termed their socio-nature characteristics. In particular, we used social representations theory to highlight the issues of human identity construction at stake in the construction of pigeons as a nuisance species. We invite the reader to consider the impact of such human self-definition on environmental stances, as it could constrain further developments or improvements of conservation perspectives.},

title={Covarying Shell Growth Parameters and the Regulation of Shell Shape in Marine Bivalves: A Case Study on Tellinoidea},
abstract={Specific parameters characterising shell shape may arguably have a significant role in the adaptation of bivalve molluscs to their particular environments. Yet, such functionally relevant shape parameters (shell outline elongation, dissymmetry, and ventral convexity) are not those parameters that the animal may directly control. Rather than shell shape, the animal regulates shell growth. Accordingly, an alternative, growth-based description of shell-shape is best fitted to understand how the animal may control the achieved shell shape. The key point is, in practice, to bring out the link between those two alternative modes of shell-shape descriptions, that is, to derive the set of equations which connects the growth-based shell-shape parameters to the functionally relevant shell-shape parameters. Thus, a preliminary object of this note is to derive this set of equations as a tool for further investigations. A second object of this work is to provide an illustrative example of implementation of this tool. I report on an unexpected negative covariance between growth-based parameters and show how this covariance results in a severe limitation of the range of interspecific variability of the degree of ventral convexity of the shell outline within the superfamily Tellinoidea. Hypotheses are proposed regarding the constraints possibly at the origin of this limitation of interspecific variability.},

title={Vulnerability and diet breadth predict larval and adult parasite diversity in fish of the Bothnian Bay},
abstract={Recent studies of aquatic food webs show that parasite diversity is concentrated in nodes that likely favour transmission. Various aspects of parasite diversity have been observed to be correlated with the trophic level, size, diet breadth, and vulnerability to predation of hosts. However, no study has attempted to distinguish among all four correlates, which may have differential importance for trophically transmitted parasites occurring as larvae or adults. We searched for factors that best predict the diversity of larval and adult endoparasites in 4105 fish in 25 species studied over a three-year period in the Bothnian Bay, Finland. Local predator-prey relationships were determined from stomach contents, parasites, and published data in 8,229 fish in 31 species and in seals and piscivorous birds. Fish that consumed more species of prey had more diverse trophically transmitted adult parasites. Larval parasite diversity increased with the diversity of both prey and predators, but increases in predator diversity had a greater effect. Prey diversity was more strongly associated with the diversity of adult parasites than with that of larvae. The proportion of parasite species present as larvae in a host species was correlated with the diversity of its predators. There was a notable lack of association with the diversity of any parasite guild and fish length, trophic level, or trophic category. Thus, diversity is associated with different nodal properties in larval and adult parasites, and association strengths also differ, strongly reflecting the life cycles of parasites and the food chains they follow to complete transmission.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={The aim of the present study was to estimate critical body residues (CBRs) of three metals [cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), chromium (Cr)] in the aquatic oligochaete Tubifex tubifex based on lethal (LBR) and sublethal effects (CBR), and to discuss the relevance of the exposure to sediment for deriving CBR. Toxicity parameters (LC^sub 50^, EC^sub 50^, LBR^sub 50^ and CBR^sub 50^) were estimated for each metal by means of data on survival and on several sublethal variables measured in short-term (4 days), water-only exposures and in long-term, chronic (14 and 28 days) exposures using metal-spiked sediment. Sublethal endpoints included autotomy in short-term exposure, as well as reproduction and growth in chronic bioassays. LBR^sub 50^ and CBR^sub 50^ were 3-6 times higher in sediment than in water-only exposure to Cd and about 2-11 times higher for Cu, depending on the measured endpoint; however, for Cr these parameters varied only by a factor of 1.2. Cu and Cr LBR^sub 50^ and CBR^sub 50^ values in 96 h water-only exposure were very similar (survival 2.39<c2><a0>[mu]mol Cu g^sup -1^ dw, 2.73<c2><a0>[mu]mol Cr g^sup -1^ dw; autotomy 0.53<c2><a0>[mu]mol Cu g^sup -1^ dw, 0.78<c2><a0>[mu]mol Cr g^sup -1^ dw). However, in metal-spiked sediments, 28 d CBR^sub 50^ values for autotomy, reproduction and growth ranged 6.76-29.54<c2><a0>[mu]mol g^sup -1^ dw for Cd, 3.88-6.23<c2><a0>[mu]mol g^sup -1^ dw for Cu, 0.65<c2><a0>[mu]mol g^sup -1^ dw for Cr (calculated only on total number of young). Exposure conditions (time and presence/absence of sediment) seem to be influential in deriving metal CBR values of Cd and Cu, while appear to be irrelevant for Cr. Thus, CBR approach for metals is complex and tissue residue-toxicity relationship is not directly applicable so far.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Issue Title: Streams in mediterranean climate regions: lessons learned from the last decade Although the California mediterranean climate region is widely considered a biodiversity hotspot for terrestrial plants and vertebrates, freshwater biodiversity in this region is generally not well known. Using information from museum specimen databases, published literature, biological assessment surveys, and specialist's knowledge, we review freshwater biodiversity for several groups of stream organisms in the med-climate region of California, which includes 2,220 species in 292 families. The groups with the highest diversity of lotic species are aquatic insects and diatoms, which comprise 39 and 36 % of species in our lists, respectively. Sequential floods and drying periods limit the overall biodiversity of many stream organisms in California mediterranean rivers, and continued climate and land-use change may cause disproportionate biodiversity declines in the region. However, only 4 % of lotic species have been evaluated in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, and many assessments are outdated. Future development of online databases for botanical and zoological collections will significantly enhance biodiversity and distribution knowledge. This information will enable us to more accurately and efficiently assess the effects of global change on biodiversity of freshwater organisms, to evaluate conservation status of individual taxa, and to set conservation priorities for stream ecosystems.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Issue Title: Streams in mediterranean climate regions: lessons learned from the last decade Rivers in mediterranean climates have been extensively modified by water management infrastructure and practices, yet patterns of development and consequent effects on freshwater ecosystems have not been compared across multiple regions. To evaluate the influence of water management on mediterranean-climate rivers, we compare the historic progression of management policies, institutions, and ecosystem impacts in the Sacramento River (California, USA), Ebro River (Spain), and Biob<c3><ad>o River (Chile) basins. There are broad similarities in patterns of ecosystem alterations related to the extensive development of dams and water management infrastructure in the three study basins. Flow regimes have been altered by the reduction of winter peak flows and increased summer baseflows. There are also common patterns of disturbance from sediment transport alteration, water quality degradation, and declines in freshwater biodiversity. Current approaches are inadequate for addressing the formidable water management challenges in California, Spain, and Chile, yet the dramatic evolution of water policies and institutions over the past 150 years suggests that further adaptation is possible. Advances toward integrated and sustainable water management models are likely to occur through incremental change, driven by growing awareness of climate change effects and public demands for water-use efficiency and improved environmental quality.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Issue Title: Streams in mediterranean climate regions: lessons learned from the last decade We review the diversity of freshwater organisms in the Mediterranean Basin (hereafter Med), particularly from streams and rivers. We present available information on the richness, endemicity, and distribution of each freshwater organism group within the Med, and make a comparison with Palearctic diversity. Approximately 35% of known Palearctic freshwater species and more than 6% of the World's freshwater species are present in the Med. A high degree of endemicity is found in the Med freshwater biota. These data, together with the degree to which many freshwater species are threatened, support the inclusion of the Med among World biodiversity hotspots. Nevertheless, knowledge of Med biodiversity is still incomplete, particularly for some taxa. Regarding to the spatial distribution of species within the Med, the richest area is the North, although patterns differ among groups. A comparison of the ecological and biological traits of endemic and non-endemic species of three riverine groups (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera) revealed that endemic species have several strategies and mechanisms to face typical mediterranean-climate conditions, such as drought, when compared to non-endemic species. We briefly analyse the conservation status of the region's biodiversity. Finally, we present some future challenges regarding the knowledge and protection of Med freshwater biodiversity.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={The effect of glyphosate-based herbicide on aquatic organisms - a case study},
abstract={The non-selective, post-emergence herbicides based on glyphosate [N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine] are one of the most widely used pesticides in agriculture, urban areas and forestry. Although there has been documentation on the physical, chemical and toxicological properties of glyphosate, the aquatic toxicity of such formulations still requires assessment and evaluation. In the present study, we describe deliberate use of glyphosate-based herbicide in a bathing area of Lake Lednica (Wielkopolska, Poland) by unknown perpetrators in April, 2011. Glyphosate was detected using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in the water samples collected from the bathing area at a mean concentration of 0.09 mg dm-3. Aboveground parts of emerged macrophytes (Phragmites australis and Typha latifolia) covering the investigated area were completely withered. Studies of benthic macroinvertebrates revealed no significant differences in taxa number between event (13 taxa) and control (14 taxa) sites although differences in abundance of particular taxa were observed. Significantly lower numbers of Chironomidae (by 41%), Oligochaeta (by 43%), Vivipariae (by 75%), Hirudinae (by 75%), Asellus aquaticus (by 77%), Gammarus pulex (by 38%) and Dreissena polymorpha (by 42%) were found at the glyphosate-treated site. Furthermore, compared to the control, chironomids (Chironomidae) exposed to glyphosate were represented by specimens smaller in length while A. aquaticus only showed large adults. The ranges of glyphosate concentration in the tissues of sampled macroinvertebrates and Phragmites australis organs were 7.3-10.2 <ce><bc>g kg-1 and 16.2-24.7 <ce><bc>g kg-1, respectively. Our study indicates that glyphosate-based herbicides may have adverse effects on aquatic organisms including macroinvertebrates, thus their use in (or nearby) surface waters should be subject to strict limitation.},

abstract={This study investigates the pro-oxidant behavior of the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine (CBZ) on the marine algal species Dunaliella tertiolecta and the immune defense-related hemocytes of mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. A phytotoxicity test, performed in a first step, showed a significant inhibition of the growth rate and the chlorophyll alpha (Chl-[alpha]) content in algae after exposure for 24 h to different concentrations of CBZ (1-200 mg L^sup -1^). On the other hand, the increased levels of lipid peroxidation products, such as MDA, measured in 24 h CBZ-treated cells were attenuated with time (48-96 h), followed by a significant recovery of both the algal growth rate and the Chl-[alpha] content in all cases. The latter could be related to the concomitant enhancement of total carotenoids in CBZ-treated algae with time, which in turn could protect algal growth and survival against CBZ-induced oxidative stress. On the other hand, the increased levels of cell death, superoxide anions (^sup <c2><b7>^O2 ^sup -^), nitric oxides (NO, in terms of nitrites, NO2 ^sup -^) and MDA content observed in mussel hemocytes exposed to environmentally relevant (0.01-1<c2><a0>[mu]g L^sup -1^) and/or higher (10 and 100<c2><a0>[mu]g L^sup -1^) concentrations of the drug, clearly indicate the ability of CBZ to induce oxidative effects on cells of non-target species, such as mussels, affecting thus their overall health status. The significant relationships occurred among the tested biological parameters in both bioassays, further reinforce CBZ-mediated pro-oxidant effects on species, widely used in ecotoxicological and toxicological studies and provide a more comprehensive view on its environmental fate and ecotoxicological risk evaluation.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Cascading effects of flow reduction on the benthic invertebrate community in a lowland river},
abstract={Reduction of flow constitutes one of the most severe human alterations to rivers, as it affects the key abiotic feature of these ecosystems. While there has been considerable progress in understanding the effects of reduced flow on benthic macroinvertebrates, cascading effects of flow reduction on dissolved oxygen concentrations (DO) have not yet received much attention. We compared the macroinvertebrate composition between reference conditions and a situation after several years of discharge reduction in the Spree River (Brandenburg, Germany). Community composition shifted from rheophilic species to species indifferent to flow conditions. Filter feeders were partially replaced by collector/gatherers, which likely reduces the retention of organic matter, and thus the self-purification capacity of the river section. These shifts were associated with low discharge during summer, cascading into daily DO concentration minima of less than 5 mg l^sup -1^ which prevailed 74% of the days in summer. This depletion of DO after flow reduction presumably caused the observed species turnover. Hence, flow reduction in lowland rivers may not only directly impair the ecological functions provided by benthic macroinvertebrates but may also act indirectly by depleting DO concentrations.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={By applying the framework proposed by Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, we analysed the current state and trends of 20 ecosystem services provided by Spanish rivers and riparian areas using 139 indicators. We compared the obtained results with the Europe and UK assessment. It is the first document that attempts to analyse the importance of services provided by Spanish rivers and riparian areas, and it forms part of the evaluation carried out for the Spanish Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. Among the provisioning services, freshwater, hydropower energy and genetic resources were classified as high importance, and water regulation and self-purification capacity, and natural hazard mitigation are among the regulating services, with landscape-aesthetic values and recreation and ecotourism featuring among the cultural services. About 61 % of the assessed ecosystem services are currently declining or degrading, but are higher than the percentage calculated for Europe (45 %) or for the UK (53 %). All regulating services are degrading, especially water regulation, natural hazard mitigation, soil formation and fertility and biological control, and the cultural services related to rural populations. Likewise, the biodiversity of Spanish aquatic ecosystems is decreasing rapidly. Land use changes and overexploitation of biological and mineral raw materials have been the main direct drivers of change in Spanish rivers and riparian zones, and relate directly to increase urbanised areas and irrigated agriculture. Finally, we draw some considerations on alternative models for aquatic ecosystems management which maintain aquatic ecosystem services and their biodiversity.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Cephalopods as Vectors of Harmful Algal Bloom Toxins in Marine Food Webs},
abstract={Here we summarize the current knowledge on the transfer and accumulation of harmful algal bloom (HAB)-related toxins in cephalopods (octopods, cuttlefishes and squids). These mollusks have been reported to accumulate several HAB-toxins, namely domoic acid (DA, and its isomers), saxitoxin (and its derivatives) and palytoxin (and palytoxin-like compounds) and, therefore, act as HAB-toxin vectors in marine food webs. Coastal octopods and cuttlefishes store considerably high levels of DA (amnesic shellfish toxin) in several tissues, but mainly in the digestive gland (DG)-the primary site of digestive absorption and intracellular digestion. Studies on the sub-cellular partitioning of DA in the soluble and insoluble fractions showed that nearly all DA (92.6%) is found in the cytosol. This favors the trophic transfer of the toxins since cytosolic substances can be absorbed by predators with greater efficiency. The available information on the accumulation and tissue distribution of DA in squids (e.g., in stranded Humboldt squids, Dosidicus gigas) is scarcer than in other cephalopod groups. Regarding paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs), these organisms accumulate them at the greatest extent in DG >> kidneys > stomach > branchial hearts > posterior salivary glands > gills. Palytoxins are among the most toxic molecules identified and stranded octopods revealed high contamination levels, with ovatoxin (a palytoxin analogue) reaching 971 <ce><bc>g kg-1 and palytoxin reaching 115 <ce><bc>g kg-1 (the regulatory limit for PlTXs is 30 <ce><bc>g kg-1 in shellfish). Although the impacts of HAB-toxins in cephalopod physiology are not as well understood as in fish species, similar effects are expected since they possess a complex nervous system and highly developed brain comparable to that of the vertebrates. Compared to bivalves, cephalopods represent a lower risk of shellfish poisoning in humans, since they are usually consumed eviscerated, with exception of traditional dishes from the Mediterranean area.},

abstract={Fine spatial and temporal phytoplankton variability in Mali Ston Bay has been observed for the first time based on physicochemical properties and small herbivorous zooplankton. Extensive year-through research was conducted during 2002 at Usko station which is traditionally an area of intensive shellfish farming. The Neretva River inflow, submarine springs (vruljas) and precipitation are additional sources of nutrients in the bay. Temperature and salinity, combined with total inorganic nitrogen (TIN) were observed to be the most important environmental factors driving the succession of phytoplankton communities. Orthophosphate was a potential limiting factor for phytoplankton development. The nanophytoplankton abundances, as well as the microphytoplankton diatoms are controlled by herbivorous zooplankton grazing ('top-down' control) more than other groups of microphytoplankton. Nanophytoplankton dominated phytoplankton abundance and its most intensive development was recorded in winter and spring, while increase in microphytoplankton abundance occurred in spring and autumn. Diatoms dominated microphytoplankton abundance mostly in winter and autumn, while dinoflagellates dominated in spring and summer. Considering the number of taxa and abundance, dinoflagellates were the dominant microphytoplankton group during the year and were the main component of the spring blooms. At that time, in conditions of elevated temperature (>16<c2><a0><c2><b0>C), decreased salinity (34-36) and increased concentrations of TIN, blooms of harmful dinoflagellate Prorocentrum minimum were recorded for the first time in the bay. The results showed a significant difference in environmental conditions, as well as in the annual phytoplankton succession and community structure, as compared with studies carried out more than 20 years ago in this area.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={The hydraulic management of large rivers led to a disconnection of side-channels. Restoration works were to reconnect these side-channels to the main course in order to recover hydrological and ecological functions. The aim of the study was to analyze the vegetation dynamics after restoration and to link it to the change in chemical and hydro-geomorphological characteristics. Changes in species richness, cover and composition of the macrophytes communities were studied in nine side-channels of the Rhine river (France) after reconnection which occurred between 1998 and 2006. Vegetation dynamics was surveyed between 2007 and 2011 and compared to the ones of three target side-channels (never disconnected). Three vegetation communities were identified: one characterized by rheophilic species, a second one by mesotrophic species, and a third one by eutrophic species. Distribution of communities depended mainly on the flow velocity and the sediment texture of the side-channels. The floristic composition of communities evolved rapidly and remained stable a few years after restoration. Changes in species richness and cover remained relatively low in all side-channels over the study period. Time after restoration did not affect the dynamics of colonization. Reconnection allowed the restored side-channels to exhibit vegetation dynamics similar to those of the target side-channels.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Ballast water is the main vector for marine invasions. To minimize the spread of invasive species, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has adopted the Ballast Water Management Convention which requires the installation of shipboard ballast water treatment systems (BWTS). During BWTS tests, the phytoplankton abundance and species composition were followed after treatment with both filtration and ultraviolet radiation. Although the installation fulfilled the IMO criteria after a 5-day holding time in a model ballast tank, the ultimate effectiveness of the treatment was further tested in long-term (20 days) incubation experiments under optimal phytoplankton growth conditions. Application of flow cytometry, microscopy, and DNA sequencing to these incubation samples gave an indication of the phytoplankton species that might be introduced by ballast water discharge--despite treatment. Phytoplankton was reliably quantified using flow cytometry, while fast identification was best done using microscopy. Some groups that contained potentially toxic species could not be identified at species level using microscopy; for these species, identification using genetic techniques was necessary. It is concluded that if long-term incubation experiments are used as an additional tool in testing BWTS effectiveness, a combination of phytoplankton screening methods can be applied depending on the detail of information that is required.},

title={Impacts of ocean acidification on marine shelled molluscs},
abstract={Issue Title: Special Issue: Acidification Over the next century, elevated quantities of atmospheric CO2 are expected to penetrate into the oceans, causing a reduction in pH (-0.3/-0.4 pH unit in the surface ocean) and in the concentration of carbonate ions (so-called ocean acidification). Of growing concern are the impacts that this will have on marine and estuarine organisms and ecosystems. Marine shelled molluscs, which colonized a large latitudinal gradient and can be found from intertidal to deep-sea habitats, are economically and ecologically important species providing essential ecosystem services including habitat structure for benthic organisms, water purification and a food source for other organisms. The effects of ocean acidification on the growth and shell production by juvenile and adult shelled molluscs are variable among species and even within the same species, precluding the drawing of a general picture. This is, however, not the case for pteropods, with all species tested so far, being negatively impacted by ocean acidification. The blood of shelled molluscs may exhibit lower pH with consequences for several physiological processes (e.g. respiration, excretion, etc.) and, in some cases, increased mortality in the long term. While fertilization may remain unaffected by elevated pCO2, embryonic and larval development will be highly sensitive with important reductions in size and decreased survival of larvae, increases in the number of abnormal larvae and an increase in the developmental time. There are big gaps in the current understanding of the biological consequences of an acidifying ocean on shelled molluscs. For instance, the natural variability of pH and the interactions of changes in the carbonate chemistry with changes in other environmental stressors such as increased temperature and changing salinity, the effects of species interactions, as well as the capacity of the organisms to acclimate and/or adapt to changing environmental conditions are poorly described.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Principles of Biofouling Protection in Marine Sponges: A Model for the Design of Novel Biomimetic and Bio-inspired Coatings in the Marine Environment?},
abstract={The process of biofouling of marine structures and substrates, such as platforms or ship hulls, proceeds in multiple steps. Soon after the formation of an initial conditioning film, formed via the adsorption of organic particles to natural or man-made substrates, a population of different bacterial taxa associates under the formation of a biofilm. These microorganisms communicate through a complex quorum sensing network. Macro-foulers, e.g., barnacles, then settle and form a fouling layer on the marine surfaces, a process that globally has severe impacts both on the economy and on the environment. Since the ban of tributyltin, an efficient replacement of this antifouling compound by next-generation antifouling coatings that are environmentally more acceptable and also showing longer half-lives has not yet been developed. The sponges, as sessile filter-feeder animals, have evolved antifouling strategies to protect themselves against micro- and subsequent macro-biofouling processes. Experimental data are summarized and suggest that coating of the sponge surface with bio-silica contributes to the inhibition of the formation of a conditioning film. A direct adsorption of the surfaces by microorganisms can be impaired through poisoning the organisms with direct-acting secondary metabolites or toxic peptides. In addition, first, compounds from sponges have been identified that interfere with the anti-quorum sensing network. Sponge secondary metabolites acting selectively on diatom colonization have not yet been identified. Finally, it is outlined that direct-acting secondary metabolites inhibiting the growth of macro-fouling animals and those that poison the multidrug resistance pump are available. It is concluded that rational screening programs for inhibitors of the complex and dynamic problem of biofilm production, based on multidisciplinary studies and using sponges as a model, are required in the future.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Spatially variable effects of a marine pest on ecosystem function},
abstract={The broad spectrum of anthropogenic pressures on many of the world's coastal bays and estuaries rarely act in isolation, yet few studies have directly addressed the interactive effects of multiple pressures. Port Phillip Bay in southeastern Australia is a semi-enclosed bay in which nutrient management is a major concern. In recent years it has been heavily invaded by marine pests. We manipulated the density of one such invader, the European fanworm Sabella spallanzanii, and showed that it causes changes in the composition of macrofauna in the surrounding sediments, provides habitat for epibiota (both fauna and flora) on Sabella tubes, and reduces the biomass of microphytobenthos on the surrounding sediments. Of greatest concern, however, was the indirect impact on nutrient cycling. We suggest that the impacts on nutrient cycling are largely due to the feeding of Sabella and the epifauna on its tubes, capturing organic N before it reaches the sediment, excreting it back up into the water column as NH^sub 4^, thereby bypassing sedimentary processes such as denitrification. Most notably, the efficiency of denitrification, the key ecosystem process that permanently removes N from the system, fell by 37-53 % in the presence of Sabella. Importantly though, this study also demonstrated significant spatial variability in fauna, geochemistry and the magnitude of Sabella effects. Given that the effect of Sabella is also likely to vary in time and with changes in density, all of these sources of variability need to be considered when incorporating the effects of Sabella in nutrient management strategies.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Biogeochemical transformation of a nutrient subsidy: salmon, streams, and nitrification},
abstract={Issue Title: Special Section: Marine Ecosystem Connections: essential indicators of healthy, productive and biologically diverse seas Migratory animals can alter ecosystem function via the provision of nutrient subsidies. These subsidies are heterogeneous in space and time, which may create hot spots or hot moments in biogeochemical transformations, in turn altering the ecosystem effect of the subsidy by changing the form of the nutrients. Annual migrations of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) transport nutrients from the marine environment to their natal freshwater ecosystems. Salmon subsidies provide high quality nutrients (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus, carbon) that may also be large in quantity where salmon migrations are near historic levels. We hypothesized that the nutrient subsidy provided via the excretion of ammonium (NH^sub 4^ ^sup +^) by live salmon would stimulate microbially mediated nitrification rates in stream sediments and increase streamwater nitrate (NO3 ^sup <c3><a2> '^) concentrations. We quantified sediment nitrification in seven streams in Southeast Alaska before and during the salmon run in 2007 and 2008. Nitrification rates increased 3-fold from before to during the salmon run (mean<c3><82> <c2><b1><c3><82> SE<c3><82> =<c3><82> 0.07<c3><82> <c2><b1><c3><82> 0.01 to 0.24<c3><82> <c2><b1><c3><82> 0.02<c3><82> mgN<c3><82> gAFDM^sup <c3><a2> '1^<c3><82> d^sup <c3><a2> '1^, respectively). The variation in nitrification was explained by both streamwater and exchangeable NH^sub 4^ ^sup +^ concentrations (R ^sup 2^<c3><82> =<c3><82> 0.50 and 0.71, respectively), which were low before salmon and increased relative to the size of the salmon run. To experimentally test the effect of salmon subsidies on nitrification rates, we staked senesced salmon carcasses on stream sediments for 3<c3><82> weeks during the salmon run and then measured nitrification rates directly under the carcasses. Sediment nitrification was 2<c3><a2>[euro]"5 times higher under the carcasses compared to nearby sediments without the direct carcass influence. Our results confirm that biogeochemical transformations alter the form of salmon-derived nitrogen, representing an overlooked aspect in the dynamics of this subsidy. Therefore, animal-derived nutrient subsidies are not passively retained or exported in recipient ecosystems, but also transformed, thereby influencing the form and incorporation of these nutrient subsidies.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Fitness Factors in Vibrios: a Mini-review},
abstract={Vibrios are Gram-negative curved bacilli that occur naturally in marine, estuarine, and freshwater systems. Some species include human and animal pathogens, and some vibrios are necessary for natural systems, including the carbon cycle and osmoregulation. Countless in vivo and in vitro studies have examined the interactions between vibrios and their environment, including molecules, cells, whole animals, and abiotic substrates. Many studies have characterized virulence factors, attachment factors, regulatory factors, and antimicrobial resistance factors, and most of these factors impact the organism's fitness regardless of its external environment. This review aims to identify common attributes among factors that increase fitness in various environments, regardless of whether the environment is an oyster, a rabbit, a flask of immortalized mammalian cells, or a planktonic chitin particle. This review aims to summarize findings published thus far to encapsulate some of the basic similarities among the many vibrio fitness factors and how they frame our understanding of vibrio ecology. Factors representing these similarities include hemolysins, capsular polysaccharides, flagella, proteases, attachment factors, type III secretion systems, chitin binding proteins, iron acquisition systems, and colonization factors.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Twenty-two Mya arenaria samples spanning seven marine ecoregions mostly situated in the Cold Temperate Northwest Atlantic (CTNA) biogeographic province were collected between 2001 and 2010 and genotyped at seven highly polymorphic microsatellite loci to test for population differentiation. Results showed strong regional differentiation with six genetic clusters: (1) Northern Gulf of St. Lawrence (GSL), (2) Magdalen Archipelago, (3) Southern GSL, (4) Lower Atlantic Canada, (5) US Coasts and (6) Northern Europe. Population structure was supported no matter the statistical approach and generally does not reflect the geographical limits of marine ecoregions. A latitudinal cline in allelic richness provides evidence for a northward post-glacial expansion range for this species. While geographical distance explains the genetic variation detected in southern CTNA, increased heterogeneity observed in northern CTNA can be explained by isolation by distance, marine landscaping and presumable selective processes acting at the Mar5 locus. Exclusion of Mar5 from analyses resulted in the detection of three genetic clusters instead of six.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Stability of lysosomal membrane in Carcinus maenas acts as a biomarker of exposure to pharmaceuticals},
abstract={The presence of pharmaceuticals in the environment is now a major concern given their potential adverse effects on organisms, particularly human beings. Because the feeding style and habitat of the crab Carcinus maenas make this species vulnerable to organic contaminants, it has been used previously in ecotoxicological studies. Lysosomal membrane stability (LMS) in crabs is a general indicator of cellular well-being and can be visualized by the neutral red retention (NRR) assay. LMS in crab hemolymph has been evaluated as a cellular biomarker of adverse effects produced by exposure to pharmaceutical compounds. Crabs were exposed in the laboratory to four different pharmaceuticals for 28 days in a semistatic 24-h renewal assay. Filtered seawater was spiked every 2 days with various concentrations (from 0.1 to 50 gL1) of caffeine, ibuprofen, carbamazepine, and novobiocin. Results showed that NRR time, measured at day 28, was significantly reduced (p<0.05) after exposure to environmental concentrations of each pharmaceutical (caffeine015 gL1; carbamazepine0 1 gL1; ibuprofen05 gL1; and novobiocin00.1 gL1) when compared with control organisms. The predicted no environmental effect concentration/ measured environmental concentration results showed that the selected pharmaceuticals are toxic at environmental concentrations and need further assessment. LMS monitoring in crabs is a sensitive tool for evaluating exposure to concentrations of selected drugs under laboratory conditions and provides a robust tier 1 testing approach (screening biomarker) for rapid assessment of marine pollution and environmental impact assessments for analyzing pharmaceutical contamination in aquatic environments.

abstract={The purpose of this microcosm experiment was to determine whether the freshwater snail Bellamya aeruginosa affected phytoplankton community and water quality. Three treatments of different snail densities (low, medium, and high) and a control (no snails) were set up in twelve enclosures. Chlorophyll a (chl a), transparency (SD), water temperature (WT), dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, nutrients, and abundance of phytoplankton were determined on days 0, 3, 7, 11, 15, 23, 31, 46, and 61. The total chl a concentration decreased and SD increased in the treatments, whereas the proportion of cyanobacteria chl a increased. Bellamya seemed to result indirectly in a decrease of DO, by reducing the algal biomass rather than by respiration. A significant decrease in nitrogen<c3><a2>[euro]"phosphorus ratios was observed in the treatments. In the enclosed system the abundance of colonial green algae decreased over time whereas that of cyanobacteria and flagellates increased. Principal response curves showed that both phytoplankton community and water quality in the medium and high-density treatments were consistently different from in the control. These results indicate that the presence of snails resulted in a significant change of water physicochemical properties and phytoplankton community.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

However, HABs may also be yellow, orange, brown, green, white, or pink, depending on which one of the three primary types of phytoplankton are responsible for the problem; dinoflagellate, diatoms, or blue-green algae. Of the more than 4,400 marine phytoplankton species, only 50 to 60 are believed to be toxic. Many HABs, produce vividly colored blooms of cells that accumulate on surface water. This paper aims to increase the awareness of the scientific community as well as the general public of the aspects and effects of such a phenomenon, seeking the search for novel techniques and tools for limiting its influences on various water bodies.

When unexposed mussels were compared, chronic effect of toxic environment in site A was confirmed by oxidative stress indices (high levels of superoxide dismutase and catalase activities, lipid peroxidation, protein carbonyls and oxyradical production, low level of total glutathione (GSH)), genotoxicity (high levels of DNA-strand breaks and caspase-3 activity in digestive gland), and cytotoxicity (low lysosomal membrane stability in hemocytes), elevated vitellogenin-like proteins (Vtg-LP) concentration in gonads, high levels of Cu, Zn, Cd, metallothionein (MT)-bound metals (MT-Me) and MT-related thiol (MT-SH), and low ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity in digestive gland. The major differences in the responses of the two exposed groups were related to antioxidant defense and MT: in the group A, prominent oxidative stress response with the participation of MT-SH and GSH in the gills, EROD activation, but decrease of MT-Me level was shown, whereas in group F exposure provoked the elevation of MT-Me, caspase-3 and Vtg-LP values. Carbamate did not cause cholinesterase depletion and cytotoxicity. However, genotoxic and pro-oxidant effects (increased levels of hemocytes with micronuclei and nuclear abnormalities, DNA-strand breaks and oxyradical in digestive gland), were common responses for both the exposed groups.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Life in an unstable house: community dynamics in changing mussel beds},
abstract={Issue Title: Long-term research on marine ecosystems in the White Sea, Russia Mussels are ecosystem engineers, and fluctuations in their abundance and population structure could be important to the associated community. There is, however, little understanding of this connection. In the present study, based on quantitative monitoring (1997-2011) of three mussel beds in a fjord-like White Sea bay, two hypotheses were tested: (1) mussel assemblages are temporally unstable and local population fluctuates cyclically as a result of negative adult-juvenile interactions; and (2) oscillations in mussel size-structure are correlated with changes in the associated community structure. A negative correlation found between the abundance of small (length < 21 mm) and large (length > 20 mm) mussels suggests that adult mussels indeed suppress recruitment. Such interaction implies an auto-oscillatory pattern of population dynamics, with Large- and Small-dominated stages temporally replacing each other. This cyclic pattern was clearly revealed for one mussel bed only, but long-term replacement of the Large-dominated stage by the Small-dominated stage was revealed for the other two assemblages also. In general, temporal variations of mussel populations were significantly correlated with the dynamics of the associated community, although several abundant taxa (Tubificoides benedii, Littorina saxatilis, Macoma balthica, and Gammaridae) were insensitive to mussel changes. In contrast, filamentous algae and mud snails Hydrobia ulvae tended to be more abundant during the Large-dominated stage, whereas polychaetes Dipolydora quadrilobata were most abundant during the Small-dominated stage. Several other abundant "sensitive" taxa were obviously dependent on algal bloom. Thus, mussel beds are unstable systems, whose dynamics are shaped not only by the ecosystem engineer but also by the associated community.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Shallow water habitat (SWH) is important for riverine fish and their invertebrate prey, yet the availability of SWH has declined in many systems due to human impacts. We evaluated the potential ecological benefits of restoring SWH by comparing zooplankton and phytoplankton from created backwaters (a floodplain feature connected to the river on the downstream end but disconnected at the upstream end) and chutes (a side channel of the river that diverts flow from the main channel through the chute and back into the main channel) on the lower Missouri River. We tested the hypothesis that backwaters support higher abundances of zooplankton and phytoplankton than chutes using data that were collected during the summer of 2010. As predicted, backwaters had more diverse cladoceran communities and greater abundances of rotifers, copepod nauplii, adult copepods, and cladocerans than chutes. Total algal biovolume was the same in chutes and backwaters; however, phytoplankton taxa richness was higher in backwaters, and there was a greater biovolume of green algae (Chlorophyta), Crypotophyta, cyanobacteria, and Euglenophyta in backwaters than in chutes. Differences in zooplankton and phytoplankton between backwaters and chutes appeared to be related to slower current velocities, longer retention times, and lower levels of turbidity and total suspended solids in backwaters. While chutes have the potential to provide greater habitat diversity than the mainstem, there were no differences in water quality or phytoplankton abundance, community structure, or diversity between these two habitats. Combined, our results suggest that created backwaters initially provide a greater potential food resource for native fishes. However, additional research is needed to determine whether chutes can also develop beneficial shallow water features over a longer period of time.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

All localities showed similar observed and expected heterozygosity values, but displayed differences in allelic richness, with lowest values obtained for localities situated farther north. Global Fst value revealed the existence of significant genetic structure; all but one locality from the Iberian Peninsula were genetically homogeneous, while more remote localities from France, The Netherlands, and Scotland were significantly different from all other localities.

Sampling was carried out using bottom trawl in depths of 3-6 m, from January to November 2005, and from October to November 2008. Pimelodus pintado began to prey upon L. fortunei soon after its arrival (austral spring of 2005). On the spring of 2008, L. fortunei was found to be the most important food item of P. pintado. The variation in length of the mussels (0.7-3.2 cm, with a mode of 1.3 cm) indicates that the species is now fully established in the system. Our data indicates that large individuals of P. pintado incorporate more mussels in their diets than small individuals. However, regardless of their size, P. pintado individuals predate only on small (<1.4 cm) representatives of L. fortunei. This prey size corresponds to a phase when the mussel is more mobile and readily available for fish. Larger, more aggregated prey groups that are attached to hard substrates are avoided by fish predators. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Using seven microsatellites, we found virtually no genetic differentiation between natural populations throughout the European range (from the south of the Wadden Sea (the Netherlands) to the south of France) and French cultivated oysters. The genetic homogeneity of Pacific oyster samples appears to be the result of repeated transfers from same seed stocks made for aquaculture and, to a lesser extent, widespread dispersal due to specific biological traits of this species. The only genetic differentiation of Sylt population in the north of the Wadden Sea (Germany) suggests a stronger, persistent impact of ongoing supply of new genetic material from hatchery production, corresponding to seeds selection made by breeders.

This study used two sets of experiments to compare interspecific variation among co-occurring species in the North Atlantic (Ireland) and separately in the North Pacific (British Columbia, Canada) chiton faunas. A complementary review of historical literature on polyplacophoran physiology provides an overview of the high level of metabolic variability in this group of 'living fossils'. Species examined in de novo experiments showed significant variation in oxygen consumption both under air-saturated water conditions (normoxia), and in response to decreasing oxygen availability (hypoxia). Some species demonstrate an ability to maintain constant oxygen uptake rates despite hypoxia (oxyregulators), while others oxyconform, with uptake rate dependent on ambient oxygen tension. These organisms are often amalgamated in studies of benthic communities, yet show obvious physiological difference that may impact their response or tolerance to environmental change.

abstract={This paper concerns the effects on biodiversity of depletion of the South African abalone Haliotis midae, which is a long-lived species with a large corrugated shell that provides a habitat for diverse benthic organisms. We compared community structure on H. midae shells with that on adjacent rock at three sites (Cape Point and Danger Point sites A and B) and at two different times of the year at one of these sites. Shells of H. midae consistently supported communities that were distinctly different from those on rock. In particular, three species of non-geniculate (encrusting) corallines, Titanoderma polycephalum, Mesophyllum engelhartii and Spongites discoideus, were all found either exclusively or predominantly on shells, whereas another non-geniculate coralline, Heydrichia woelkerlingii, occurred almost exclusively on adjacent rock. The primary rocky substratum, however, supported a higher number of species than abalone shells. Possible reasons for the differences between the two substrata include the relative age, microtopography and hardness of the substrata; the abundance of grazers on them; and the relative age of different zones of the abalone shell, which support communities at different stages of succession. Diversity on shells was lowest in zones that were either very young or very old, in keeping with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. The distinctiveness of shell epibiota will increase [beta] diversity despite having a lower [alpha] diversity than that of adjacent rock. Decimation of H. midae by overfishing therefore has implications for biodiversity conservation.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={The present study analyzes the acute and behavioral toxicity of two commercial formulations of endosulfan and atrazine (Gesaprim 90 WDG and Zebra Ciagro, respectively) on the cyclopoid copepod Mesocyclops longisetus. The studied behavior was the "escape ability" because of its ecological importance in natural predator-prey interactions. This was investigated using two experimental designs: (1) a simulated predator (applying a hydraulic device) and (2) a real one (the zooplanktophagous fish Cnesterodon decemmaculatus). Both pesticides resulted highly toxic to adults and nauplii at even relatively low concentrations and similar to those found in field studies. Copepods' survival was not only directly affected but also indirectly through altering their escape behavior, which may have increased their vulnerability to predation. The escape ability, measured with the simulated predator was stimulated early (up to 6 h of exposition) but inhibited later (after 24 h of exposition). The predation experiments with the real predator were in accordance with these results. The comparison of both experimental designs corroborates the effectiveness of the hydraulic mechanism as a testing method.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

This gives a high scientific and political legitimacy to the end product and enables an effective prioritization of management efforts, while at the same time paying attention to the precautionary principle. The criteria chosen are applicable to all species regardless of taxonomic position. This makes the assessment scheme comparable to the Red List criteria used to classify threatened species. The impact of alien species is expressed along two independent axes, one measuring invasion potential, the other ecological effects. Using this two-dimensional approach, the categorization captures the ecological impact of alien species, which is the product rather than the sum of spread and effect. Invasion potential is assessed using three criteria, including expected population lifetime and expansion rate. Ecological effects are evaluated using six criteria, including interactions with native species, changes in landscape types, and the potential to transmit genes or parasites. Effects on threatened species or landscape types receive greater weightings.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Assessing Nitrogen Dynamics Throughout the Estuarine Landscape},
abstract={Assessing nitrogen dynamics in the estuarine landscape is challenging given the unique effects of individual habitats on nitrogen dynamics. We measured net N2 fluxes, sediment oxygen demand, and fluxes of ammonium and nitrate seasonally from five major estuarine habitats: salt marshes, seagrass beds (SAV), oyster reefs, and intertidal and subtidal flats. Net N2 fluxes ranged from 332<c2><b1>116<c2><a0><ce><bc>molN-N2m^sup -2^h^sup -1^ from oyster reef sediments in the summer to -67<c2><b1>4<c2><a0><ce><bc>molN-N2m^sup -2^h^sup -1^ from SAV in the winter. Oyster reef sediments had the highest rate of N2 production of all habitats. Dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) was measured during the summer and winter. DNRA was low during the winter and ranged from 4.5<c2><b1>3.0 in subtidal flats to 104<c2><b1>34<c2><a0><ce><bc>mol^sup 15^NH^sub 4^^sup +^m^sup -2^h^sup -1^ in oyster reefs during the summer.

abstract={Taihu Lake is the largest shallow freshwater lake in eastern China and is suffering not only from an increasingly serious threat of eutrophication but also potential ecological risk due to the input of emerging contaminants. Active biomonitoring was conducted in Taihu Lake using transplanted goldfish (Carassius auratus) to determine the contamination by pharmaceuticals and metals and to assess the potential ecological risk. A suite of biomarkers including acetylcholinesterase, ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase, glutathione S-transferase, glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase activities in fish after 7, 14, 21 and 28 days of exposure in situ, as well as pharmaceuticals and metals in water, were determined during the field exposure period. The results indicate that pharmaceuticals exist mainly in Zhushan Bay and Meiliang Bay, while metals are present mainly in Gong Bay. An integrated biomarker response (IBR) was calculated and used to evaluate the ecological risk of the polluted area of Taihu Lake. It was found that Zhushan Bay might present higher risk to fish, followed by Meiliang Bay. IBR values were in good agreement with copper and caffeine concentrations.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Effects of salinity on the immune response of an 'osmotic generalist' bird},
abstract={Salt stress can suppress the immune function of fish and other aquatic animals, but such an effect has not yet been examined in air-breathing vertebrates that frequently cope with waters (and prey) of contrasting salinities. We investigated the effects of seawater salinity on the strength and cost of mounting an immune response in the dunlin Calidris alpina, a long-distance migratory shorebird that shifts seasonally from freshwater environments during the breeding season to marine environments during migration and the winter period. Phytohaemagglutinin (PHA)-induced skin swelling, basal metabolic rate (BMR), body mass, fat stores, and plasma ions were measured in dunlins acclimated to either freshwater or seawater (salinity: 0.3 and 35.0<c2><a0>[per thousand], respectively). Seawater-acclimated dunlins mounted a PHA-induced swelling response that was up to 56 % weaker than those held under freshwater conditions, despite ad libitum access to food. Freshwater-acclimated dunlins significantly increased their relative BMR 48 h after PHA injection, whereas seawater-acclimated dunlins did not. However, this differential immune and metabolic response between freshwater- and seawater-acclimated dunlins was not associated with significant changes in body mass, fat stores or plasma ions. Our results indicate that the strength of the immune response of this small-sized migratory shorebird was negatively influenced by the salinity of marine habitats. Further, these findings suggest that the reduced immune response observed under saline conditions might not be caused by an energy or nutrient limitation, and raise questions about the role of osmoregulatory hormones in the modulation of the immune system.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Managing wetlands as off-river storages: impacts on zooplankton communities},
abstract={The competing demands of the environment and agriculture has challenged managers of waterways and prompted the development of new and novel ways of providing water for consumptive use without compromising the aquatic ecosystem. One partial remedy that has been proposed involves using wetlands as intermediary off-river storages to achieve consumptive benefits whilst maintaining ecological values. This study assessed the suitability of such a strategy by examining the impact of artificial drawdown on wetland zooplankton communities. An experiment was undertaken in outdoor mesocosms in which two treatments were compared over a 109-day duration: (1) partial artificial drawdown--where approximately half of the water was siphoned out after 42 days; and (2) natural drawdown--where the water was left to drawdown naturally via evaporation. Artificial drawdown only caused a small acceleration (<4 weeks) in the decline of abundance and density associated with natural population fluctuations, and temporarily changed the community structure. Furthermore, it had no effect on taxon richness, community composition and the initiation of dormancy. This suggests that wetlands could potentially be used for supporting consumptive demands whilst still maintaining abundant and diverse zooplankton communities, and hence a suitable food supply for higher order consumers such as fish and waterfowl.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

The approach of maintaining Pacific salmonine (e.g., Chinook and coho salmon, steelhead) populations at levels that provide recreational opportunities and that control non-indigenous forage fishes, while making a major commitment to rehabilitate native species, is a challenging but appropriate management approach given the biological and institutional realities, social concerns, and priorities. Given this challenge, we recommend the following priority research actions to increase the likelihood of achieving the FCOs in the coming years: 1. reassess the Level II triggers in the red-flag analysis and fuse this analysis with DA to provide for more strategic management actions, 2. ensure interagency lake trout sampling is sufficient to allow measurement of the benchmarks identified in the new implementation strategy, and 3. promote rehabilitation of native prey fishes, such as bloater and cisco.},

title={Windows of change: temporal scale of analysis is decisive to detect ecosystem responses to climate change},
abstract={Issue Title: Special Issue: AQUASHIFT: The Impact of Climate Variability on Aquatic Ecosystems Long-term ecological research has become a cornerstone of the scientific endeavour to better understand ecosystem responses to environmental change. This paper provides a perspective on how such research could be advanced. It emphasizes that a profound understanding of the mechanisms underlying these responses requires that records of ecologic processes be not only sufficiently long, but also collected at an appropriate temporal resolution. We base our argument on an overview of studies of climate impacts in limnic and marine ecosystems, suggesting that lakes and oceans respond to (short-term) weather conditions during critical time windows in the year. The observed response patterns are often time-lagged or driven by the crossing of thresholds in weather-related variables (such as water temperature and thermal stratification intensity). It becomes clear from the previous studies that average annual, seasonal or monthly climate data often fall short of characterizing the thermal dynamics that most organisms respond to. To illustrate such literature-based evidence using a concrete example, we compare 2<c2><a0>years of water temperature data from M<c3><bc>ggelsee (Berlin, Germany) at multiple temporal scales (from hours to years). This comparison underlines the pitfalls of analysing data at resolutions not high enough to detect critical differences in environmental forcing. Current science initiatives that aim at improving the temporal resolution of long-term observatory data in aquatic systems will help to identify adequate timescales of analysis necessary for the understanding of ecosystem responses to climate change.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Issue Title: Special Issue: AQUASHIFT: The Impact of Climate Variability on Aquatic Ecosystems In this paper, we present an approach for describing the environmentally induced temporal pattern of structured populations by partial integro-differential equations. Populations are structured according to size or stage. Growth, energy allocation and stage transitions are affected by environmental conditions of which temperature, photoperiod, water depth and food supply were taken into account. The resulting modelling framework was applied to describe, analyse and predict alterations in populations with continuous development, populations with distinct state structures and interacting populations. Our exemplary applications consider populations of freshwater Amphipoda, Isopoda and Odonata. The model was capable of simulating life cycle alterations in dependence on temperature in interaction with other environmental factors: (1) population dynamics, (2) seasonal regulation, (3) water depth-dependent dispersal, (4) intraguild predation and (5) consumer-resource dynamics.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Issue Title: Limnology and Aquatic Birds: Monitoring, Modelling and Management Owing to synchronous moult, most waterbird species are constrained by flightlessness and limited mobility for several weeks. As new feather production is energy demanding, these birds need to choose a safe moulting site with appropriate food supply. Up to 20,000 waterbirds carry out moult at Lake Constance, gathering at sites where they find food close to safe hiding places from predators and human-caused disturbance. In this study, we focused on the food supply at one prominent moulting site, Mettnau S<c3><bc>dbucht, at Lower Lake Constance. We aimed to determine the food items and quantity as well as their utilization by summering and moulting waterbirds. We conducted experiments with exclosure cages which protected macrophytes from bird grazing and compared these sites with unprotected grazed sites. In these experiments, we found that the summering and moulting waterbird community, dominated by Eurasian Coots (Fulica atra Linnaeus), caused a significant decline of the macrophyte biomass at 1.5-m depth (MWL), where they were responsible for a loss of over 40% of the total charophyte biomass. No grazing effect was found at a greater depth (2-m<c2><a0>MWL). The available food consisted mostly of Chara spp. with a biomass density of about 350<c2><a0>g<c2><a0>m^sup -2^. Animal food items were negligible: Macroinvertebrates, mainly Asellus aquaticus Linnaeus, that were associated with the macrophytes, made up only 2% of total biomass, and were very unevenly distributed.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={The embryos of a marine abalone, Haliotis diversicolor supertexta, were exposed to a typical environmental estrogen, 17<ce><b1>-ethynylestradiol (EE2), for 96<c2><a0>h, to examine the acute toxicity of EE2 to the embryogenesis of the abalone. A marine diatom, Navicula incerta, was used in the test media as settlement substrate and food for the abalone larvae. During the embryo culture, more than 30<c2><a0>% of EE2 could be removed from the test media by the diatom, mainly via biodegradation, leading to a decrease of water-borne exposure dose. Further, the exposure concentrations of EE2 around the living microenvironment of the abalone larvae could be magnified 350-468 times after the larvae settled on the diatom, as indicated by the bioconcentration factors of EE2 in the diatom. Increased bioaccumulation of EE2 in the diatom caused greater inhibition on the metamorphosis of the abalone larvae by enhancing the uptake of EE2 in the larvae via dietary exposure, while declined water-borne exposure dose did not affect the embryonic toxicity of EE2 and its uptake in the abalone larvae. The 96-h median effective concentration of EE2 to the metamorphosis of the abalone larvae was 10.01<c2><a0><ce><bc>g<c2><a0>L^sup -1^, when the exposure doses in both the test media and the diatom were controlled stable. The 96-h hazard concentration for 5<c2><a0>% of the species was 1.20<c2><a0><ce><bc>g<c2><a0>L^sup -1^, which was still higher than but close to the reported upper contamination level of EE2 and could be employed as the safety threshold for the metamorphosis of the abalone embryos.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={The river shrimp Athyaephyra desmaresti is a Mediterranean species which in recent years expanded its distribution, colonizing rivers of central Europe. The purpose of this study was to investigate the possibility of passive external dispersal of the river shrimp Athyaephyra desmaresti by waterfowl. We performed experiments testing shrimp desiccation survival, probability of attachment to waterfowl, and probability of successful transport. We found that in the laboratory 10% of the river shrimps can survive out of water for up to 90.1<c2><a0>min, but this period was reduced to 18.5<c2><a0>min under simulated bird flight conditions. Two different outdoor experiments simulating bird flight conditions indicated a 50% probability of successful transport on flight distances over 15<c2><a0>km. Our results using dead ducks show evidence that small, large or ovigerous river shrimps can attach to and be transported by ducks and that this capacity is affected by water depth. This study demonstrated that waterbird-mediated passive dispersal of river shrimps can occur and may be important for genetic flows between populations and for the colonization of new sites.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

We also studied the chemical, physical and meteo-climatic parameters in the same environment, to evaluate the possible effects of environmental conditions on protozoan contamination in farmed shellfish. Using both IF and molecular tests, all 38 pools of shellfish gave negative values for Giardia and Cryptosporidium oo/cysts, thus confirming previous investigations. The environmental factors considered having a negative influence on the survival of Giardia and Cryptosporidium are high water temperatures (8-29<c2><b0>C) and high salinity levels (23-32<c2><a0>ppt). However, the small amount of freshwater discharged into the lagoon (up to 0.0091<c2><a0>m^sup 3^ s^sup -1^), the long-lasting solar irradiation (mean of 896<c2><a0>W<c2><a0>m^sup -2^) and the shallowness of the lagoon (mean 2.5<c2><a0>m) may also have a synergic effect in limiting the presence of Giardia and Cryptosporidium in the lagoon.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Are the toxic sediments deposited at Flix reservoir affecting the Ebro river biota? Purple heron eggs and nestlings as indicators},
abstract={The Flix reservoir, in the low course of the Ebro River, contains thousands of tons of polluted sediments, accumulated from the activities of a chemical factory. An ongoing project is working toward removing these pollutants. Piscivore birds like the purple heron (Ardea purpurea) may be useful bioindicators, so eggs and nestling feathers were sampled during the 2006-2008 breeding seasons at three localities: a reference site situated upstream and two potentially affected by the toxic muds; one at the focal area and one at a distal area, the Ebro Delta. The samples were analyzed for isotopic signatures of ^sup 15^N and ^sup 13^C and concentrations of heavy metals and selenium. Baseline nitrogen signatures were higher in riverine sites than in the delta. Nitrogen together with carbon signatures adequately discriminated riverine and deltaic ecosystems. Mercury levels are highly influenced by the polluted sediments at Flix and pose potential risks for the birds, as they are among the highest ever recorded in heron species. Selenium and copper concentrations probably derive from other sources. Except for mercury, heavy metals and selenium levels were below toxic levels. Purple heron eggs and nestling feathers have demonstrated their usefulness as bioindicators for pollution in the river biota; feathers in particular show pollutant impacts on a strict local basis. A long series of study years is necessary in dynamic ecosystems such as this, so continued monitoring of the heron population at Flix is advisable to trace the effects of the toxic muds, particularly during their removal, because of the high levels of mercury detected.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={We measured a suite of common biomarker responses for the first time in the Sydney rock oyster Saccostrea glomerata to evaluate their utility as biological effects measures for pollution monitoring. To examine the relationship between biomarker responses and population level effects, fertilisation and embryo development assays were also conducted. Adult oysters were deployed in two contaminated estuaries and a reference estuary in Sydney, Australia. The concentrations of various contaminants (metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, PAHs) were quantified in oyster's tissue from each site and both metals and total PAHs were significantly elevated in contaminated estuaries relative to the reference estuary. Lysosomal membrane destabilisation, lipid peroxidation levels and glutathione (GSH) concentrations were measured in the digestive gland of oysters. Of all biomarkers measured, lysosomal membrane destabilisation proved to be the most useful indicator of oysters facing anthropogenic stress and we suggest this may be an especially useful biomarker for incorporation into local environmental monitoring programs. Moreover, lysosomal membrane destabilisation showed good correlations with fertilisation, normal embryo development and estuary status. GSH and lipid peroxidation were not as valuable for distinguishing between estuaries exposed to differing levels of anthropogenic stress, but did provide additional valuable information regarding overall health status of the oysters.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Low salinities and temperatures did not support larval survival and development, with salinity being the main restricting factor for survival, while temperature affected mainly the duration of the larval stages.

title={Trophic ecology of reef sharks determined using stable isotopes and telemetry},
abstract={Establishing the ecological role of predators within an ecosystem is central to understanding community dynamics and is useful in designing effective management and conservation strategies. We analysed differences in the trophic ecology of four species of reef sharks (Carcharhinus melanopterus, Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos, Triaenodon obesus and Negaprion acutidens) at Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia, by analysing tissue stable isotopes (<ce><b4>^sup 15^N and <ce><b4>^sup 13^C). We also monitored animals using acoustic telemetry to determine long-term residency patterns in a bay at the southern end of the reef, Coral Bay. Overall, mean <ce><b4>^sup 13^C was similar among species, ranging between -10.9 and -11.8[per thousand], suggesting a food-web dependency on coastal producers. Classification and regression tree analysis identified an effect of species on <ce><b4>^sup 15^N that separated C. amblyrhynchos and C. melanopterus from N. acutidens and T. obesus. For C. amblyrhynchos and C. melanopterus, animals were also divided by size classes, with smaller sharks having lower average <ce><b4>^sup 15^N than larger animals; this suggests that <ce><b4>^sup 15^N increases with size for these two species. Juvenile C. melanopterus, juvenile N. acutidens and adult T. obesus had trophic levels of 3.7, for juvenile C. amblyrhynchos and adult C. melanopterus it was 4, and adult C. amblyrhynchos had a value of 4.3. Trophic-level estimates for C. melanopterus and C. amblyrhynchos corroborate previous conclusions based on diet studies. We found no evidence for a difference in isotopic composition between resident and non-resident sharks. The lack of variation in isotopic composition was consistent with high mean residency of these species recorded using acoustic telemetry, which was 79% (<c2><b1>0.09 SE) of days monitored for T. obesus, followed by N. acutidens (57<c2><a0><c2><b1><c2><a0>19.55%), C. amblyrhynchos (54<c2><a0><c2><b1><c2><a0>13%) and C. melanopterus (33<c2><a0><c2><b1><c2><a0>8.28%). High <ce><b4>^sup 13^C composition in reef sharks and long-term residency behaviour suggest that coastal marine reserves might provide effective conservation refuges for some species.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={The variability of shell morphology and relative growth of the invasive pearl oyster Pinctada radiata was studied within and among ten populations from coastal Tunisia using discriminant tests. Therefore, 12 morphological characters were examined and 34 metric and weight ratios were defined. In addition to the classic morphological characters, populations were compared by the thickness of the nacreous layer. Results of Duncan's multiple comparison test showed that the most discriminative ratios were the width of nacreous layer of right valve to the inflation of shell, the hinge line length to the maximum width of shell and the nacre thickness to the maximum width of shell. The analysis of variance revealed an important inter-population morphological variability. Both multidimensional scaling analysis and the squared Mahalanobis distances (D 2) of metric ratios divided Tunisian P. radiata populations into four biogeographical groupings: the north coast (La Marsa); harbours (Hammamet, Monastir and Zarzis); the Gulf of Gab<c3><a8>s (Sfax, Kerkennah Island, Mahar<c3><a8>s, Skhira and Djerba) and the intertidal area (Ajim). However, the Kerkennah Island population was discriminated by the squared Mahalanobis distances (D 2) of weight ratios in an isolated group suggesting particular trophic conditions in this area. The allometric study revealed high linear correlation between shell morphological characters and differences in allometric growth among P. radiata populations. Unlike the morphological discrimination, allometric differentiation shows no clear geographical distinction. This study revealed that the pearl oyster P. radiata exhibited considerable phenotypic plasticity related to differences of environmental and/or ecological conditions along Tunisian coasts and highlighted the discriminative character of the nacreous layer thickness parameter.

title={Mercury in the pelagic food web of Lake Champlain},
abstract={Lake Champlain continues to experience mercury contamination resulting in public advisories to limit human consumption of top trophic level fish such as walleye. Prior research suggested that mercury levels in biota could be modified by differences in ecosystem productivity as well as mercury loadings. We investigated relationships between mercury in different trophic levels in Lake Champlain. We measured inorganic and methyl mercury in water, seston, and two size fractions of zooplankton from 13 sites representing a range of nutrient loading conditions and productivity. Biomass varied significantly across lake segments in all measured ecosystem compartments in response to significant differences in nutrient levels. Local environmental factors such as alkalinity influenced the partitioning of mercury between water and seston. Mercury incorporation into biota was influenced by the biomass and mercury content of different ecosystem strata. Pelagic fish tissue mercury was a function of fish length and the size of the mercury pool associated with large zooplankton. We used these observations to parameterize a model of mercury transfers in the Lake Champlain food web that accounts for ecosystem productivity effects. Simulations using the mercury trophic transfer model suggest that reductions of 25-75% in summertime dissolved eplimnetic total mercury will likely allow fish tissue mercury concentrations to drop to the target level of 0.3<c2><a0><ce><bc>g<c2><a0>g^sup -1^ in a 40-cm fish in all lake segments. Changes in nutrient loading and ecosystem productivity in eutrophic segments may delay any response to reduced dissolved mercury and may result in increases in fish tissue mercury.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Integrated assessment of biomarker responses in caged shrimps (Litopenaeus vannamei) exposed to complex contaminants from the Maluan Bay of China},
abstract={The marine shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei were used as an active biomonitoring organism to assess the bioavailability and impact of metal contaminants in seven study sites along the Maluan Bay of China. Metal concentrations in the hepatopancreas of shrimps were determined in conjunction with four biomarkers responses after a 7<c2><a0>day in situ cage exposures. The results showed that contaminant tissue burdens at the deployment sites were greater than those of the reference site, and antioxidant enzyme activities were strongly inhibited compared to those of reference organisms. Variations in these biomarker responses were correlated significantly (p<c2><a0><<c2><a0>0.05 or p<c2><a0><<c2><a0>0.01) with the specific metal pollutants at the study sites, but no significant correlations existed between catalase activity responses and the metal contaminants. This suggests the presence of undetermined contaminants or other exposure routes that may be responsible for the decreased catalase activity. Multivariate analysis revealed a causal relationship between contaminants at each deployment site and the biochemical "response" of the caged shrimps at these sites and demonstrated the presence of two contaminant "hot" spots. This investigation suggested that the incorporation of chemical data on trace metal concentrations with the analysis of antioxidant enzymatic activities in caged shrimps can be a useful tool for the identification of causal toxic contaminants in complex mixtures.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={This study provides information about differences in composition of ingested zooplankton amongst bivalve species coexisting in the same area in a period from May 2009 to December 2010. The study was conducted at the Mali Ston Bay (42<c2><b0>51' N, 17<c2><b0>40' E)--the most important bivalve aquaculture area in the eastern Adriatic Sea. Stomach content analysis was performed on cultured species--Ostrea edulis and Mytilus galloprovincialis, and commercially important bivalve species from their natural environment--Modiolus barbatus and Arca noae. Results confirmed carnivory in bivalves, both from natural and cultured populations, but cultured species had higher numbers of zooplankters than those living on the seabed. The most abundant taxa were bivalve larvae, followed by tintinnids, copepods, unidentified eggs and gastropod larvae. Recorded numbers of bivalve larvae in M. galloprovincialis stomach were the highest so far reported and show that mussels impact the availability of natural spat.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Environmental genotoxicity and cytotoxicity effects in the gills of mussels Mytilus edulis, from the Baltic Sea areas close to the Buting oil terminal (Lithuania) before and after accidental oil spill in 31 January 2008 were studied. Mussels from the oil spillage zones were collected in 12<c2><a0>days, in 3 and 6<c2><a0>months after the spill to determine the effects of the spill. Mussels sampled in 2006-2007 were used for the assessment of the background levels of genotoxicity and cytotoxicity in the Buting oil terminal area. Comparison of the responses in M. edulis before and after the oil spill revealed significant elevation of frequencies of micronuclei (MN), nuclear buds (NB) and fragmented-apoptotic (FA) cells. Environmental genotoxicity and cytotoxicity levels in mussels from the Palanga site before the accident (in June 2007) served as a reference. Six months after the accident, in July 2008, 5.6-fold increase of MN, 2.9-fold elevation of NB, and 8.8-fold elevation of FA cells were observed in mussels from the same site.

title={Organotin contamination in South American coastal areas},
abstract={Organotin compounds (OT) were used in antifouling paints for more than four decades. However, due to their widespread intensive use and high toxicity, undesirable effects in non-target marine organisms have been detected since the early 1980s. Consequently, the International Maritime Organization banned new maritime applications of these products on January 1, 2003 and their presence on ship hulls from January 1, 2008. Although extensively studied in Europe, North America, Oceania, and Asia, environmental levels and effects of organotin contamination are still poorly known for South America. Thus, the current review aimed to present the actual status of this problem in South America by summarizing and comparing the available data in the literature. An overview of the OTs concentrations in sediment and biota and their effects, mainly imposex in marine gastropods, are presented. This work showed that in Atlantic coastal areas of South America there are "hot spots" of OTs contamination, similar to that observed in industrialized countries of Northern Hemisphere. On the other hand, the number of accomplished studies in the Pacific coast is extremely low. Despite the limitation on studies about OTs environmental levels and their related effects, the available data pointed out for a widespread TBT contamination along the South American coastal areas. Therefore, the establishment of baselines of organotin contamination in the Pacific coast and the implementation of temporal trend studies in the South American coastal areas is crucial to verify the effectiveness of local regulations and OTs global ban, and to map the most sensitive areas related to present and future antifouling impacts.

abstract={Issue Title: Evolution and Biodiversity in Ancient Lakes - Proceedings of the 5th Symposium on Speciation in Ancient Lakes, Ohrid, Macedonia, September 7-11, 2009 The aragonite shells of 55<c2><a0>mollusc specimens from the late Early and early Middle Miocene of two palaeolakes of the Dinaride Lake System (DLS) are analysed for their <ce><b4>^sup 18^O and <ce><b4>^sup 13^C signatures. The data set has a bimodal distribution with a prominent peak between -3 and -4[per thousand] for both isotopes and a second much weaker peak at more depleted values of c. -9 to -7[per thousand]. Taxa with 'heavy' values are interpreted to represent the inhabitants of the shores or shallow areas of the lake. Depleted values are attributed to species preferring freshwater habitats of springs or small rivulets, thus representing the freshwater end-member. The overall rather high values in both stable isotopes result from a combination of evaporation effects and the influx of already isotopically heavy freshwater from the karstic catchment area. Thus, the DLS is interpreted as a closed freshwater system without marine influence but with enough contribution of freshwater to keep the oxygen values close to -5[per thousand]. Mean lake surface water temperatures, based on the <ce><b4>^sup 18^O^sub shell^ values, excluding the freshwater end-member taxa, range around roughly 19-21<c2><b0>C. Despite the problems in calculating these temperatures, the values are in agreement with mean annual air temperatures deduced from the palaeobotanic record by applying the Coexistence Approach method. The seasonal range was around 10-11<c2><b0>C and is mainly recorded in shells from lake settings. Taxa with freshwater end-member signatures lack this range due to the more stable temperature regime and less fluctuating dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) pool. Congeneric species from the same stratigraphic horizon often display discrete but different isotope signatures. This fact suggests habitat segregation and might be a major factor for sympatric speciation and the endemic radiation within the mollusc fauna of the DLS.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={The amount of food and when it is available affect both the timing of reproduction and the number of gametes produced by purple sea urchins, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. To investigate this further, the effects of food availability on feeding rates, gonad growth, and gamete development were examined in S. purpuratus collected from the Point Loma kelp forest near San Diego, California, USA (32.69<c2><b0> N, 117.26<c2><b0> W) in September (Fall) 2007, and February (Spring) and July (Summer) 2008, using laboratory mesocosms. Each seasonal laboratory feeding experiment lasted 3<c2><a0>months, and different levels of food availability were established with different feeding frequencies (from 1 to 7<c2><a0>days week^sup -1^). Gonad tissues of male and female urchins were staged at the end of each experiment using histological analyses. Reduced food availability resulted in increased daily consumption rates, especially in the Fall when gamete development began. Food limitation at this time resulted in failure to produce viable gametes, suggesting there is a critical period early in gonad development when food limitation affects reproductive competency. Food limitation later in gonad development did not stop viable gamete production, although it did reduce gamete output.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Molecular Response of the Bloom-Forming Cyanobacterium, Microcystis aeruginosa, to Phosphorus Limitation},
abstract={Cyanobacteria blooms caused by species such as Microcystis have become commonplace in many freshwater ecosystems. Although phosphorus (P) typically limits the growth of freshwater phytoplankton populations, little is known regarding the molecular response of Microcystis to variation in P concentrations and sources. For this study, we examined genes involved in P acquisition in Microcystis including two high-affinity phosphate-binding proteins (pstS and sphX) and a putative alkaline phosphatase (phoX). Sequence analyses among ten clones of Microcystis aeruginosa and one clone of Microcystis wesenbergii indicates that these genes are present and conserved within the species, but perhaps not the genus, as phoX was not identified in M. wesenbergii. Experiments with clones of M. aeruginosa indicated that expression of these three genes was strongly upregulated (50- to 400-fold) under low inorganic P conditions and that the expression of phoX was correlated with alkaline phosphatase activity (p<0.005). In contrast, cultures grown exclusively on high levels of organic phosphorus sources (adenosine 5'-monophosphate, <ce><b2>-glycerol phosphate, and d-glucose-6-phosphate) or under nitrogen-limited conditions displayed neither high levels of gene expression nor alkaline phosphatase activity. Since Microcystis dominates phytoplankton assemblages in summer when levels of inorganic P (P^sub i^) are often low and/or dominate lakes with low P^sub i^ and high organic P, our findings suggest this cyanobacterium may rely on pstS, sphX, and phoX to efficiently transport P^sub i^ and exploit organic sources of P to form blooms.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Modelling the impact of toxic and disturbance stress on white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) populations},
abstract={Several studies have related breeding success and survival of sea eagles to toxic or non-toxic stress separately. In the present investigation, we analysed single and combined impacts of both toxic and disturbance stress on populations of white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla), using an analytical single-species model. Chemical and eco(toxico)logical data reported from laboratory and field studies were used to parameterise and validate the model. The model was applied to assess the impact of <e2><88><91>PCB, DDE and disturbance stress on the white-tailed eagle population in The Netherlands. Disturbance stress was incorporated through a 1.6% reduction in survival and a 10-50% reduction in reproduction. <e2><88><91>PCB contamination from 1950 up to 1987 was found to be too high to allow the return of white-tailed eagle as a breeding species in that period. <e2><88><91>PCB and population trends simulated for 2006-2050 suggest that future population growth is still reduced. Disturbance stress resulted in a reduced population development. The combination of both toxic and disturbance stress varied from a slower population development to a catastrophical reduction in population size, where the main cause was attributed to the reduction in reproduction of 50%. Application of the model was restricted by the current lack of quantitative dose-response relationships between non-toxic stress and survival and reproduction. Nevertheless, the model provides a first step towards integrating and quantifying the impacts of multiple stressors on white-tailed eagle populations.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={This research shows the results of an analysis of siliceous spicules found in sediment cores collected in Lake Trasimeno (Umbria, Italy), a shallow lake that experienced an important water level lowering during the last century. A morphological analysis of sedimentary sponge records revealed that the spicules accumulated in the lake sediments over the last 150<c2><a0>years are attributable to Ephydatia fluviatilis, the only sponge species found in the lake in recent years. The stratigraphic analysis of the cores showed that the abundance and size of the sponge spicules (megascleres) have remarkably decreased, suggesting that a significant depletion of the sponge fauna occurred, particularly during the first half of the twentieth century. A correlation analysis has identified morpho-hydrological and related variables (the theoretical fraction of lake surface subjected to resuspension and the amount of total suspended solids) as the most significant factors explaining the change in density of sponge spicules. Two ecological explanations of the sponge decline are proposed, based on the sensitivity of the sponge both to the availability of suitable hard substrata for colonization, and to the amount of wind-resuspended solids. One-ended sigmoid response curves were obtained by regression and corresponding transfer functions were derived, which allow the mean water depth of the lake and total suspended solids to be inferred from spicule density records. The results support the use of sponge spicules as a paleohydrological and paleoecological proxy, application of which appears particularly promising for shallow-water systems.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={It has been hypothesized that climate change is an underlying factor in determining fish abundances in the Hudson River estuary (HRE). To study the effects of hydrology and climate on the HRE fish community, we applied multivariate statistical methods to data on 20 speciesâ€“life history stages collected from 1974 to 2005. We confirm that the HRE fish community has changed over this period. These changes are correlated with local hydrology (freshwater flow and water temperature) and regional climate (the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation [AMO] and North Atlantic Oscillation). We found that the abundances of striped bass Morone saxatilis larval stages are positively correlated with high freshwater flows and those of juvenile American shad Alosa sapidissima negatively correlated with the AMO or warmer sea surface temperatures. Our findings suggest that climateâ€related variability affects HRE juvenile shad abundances and that management strategies for this declining species should include the implications of climate change.Received March 19, 2011; accepted January 10, 2012},

title={Incorporating spatial variation of nitrification and denitrification rates into whole-lake nitrogen dynamics},
abstract={Despite dramatic increases in nitrogen (N) loading to fresh waters and growing scientific attention on the changing N cycle, measurements of nitrification and denitrification rates in lakes are lacking. In particular, we know little about how these processes vary spatially within a lake, and how this potential spatial variation contributes to a lake's N dynamics. We measured sediment nitrification and denitrification rates at 40 sites in Gull Lake, Michigan (USA), and found that the shallow edge sediments (<2 m deep) of the lake were hot spots of N transformation. Nitrification rates were comparable in sediments at all depths, while sediment denitrification rates were highest in the shallow edge habitat, and lowest in the profundal sediments (<2 m and >10 m deep, respectively). We scaled-up our sediment transformation rates across the lake to illustrate spatial variability in nitrification and denitrification. For whole-lake nitrification, the contribution of shallow edge, littoral, and profundal sediments followed in proportion to lake surface area of each habitat. In contrast, the contribution of each of these areas to whole-lake denitrification was not proportional to their respective surface areas, and instead was equal across the 3 habitat types, with each area contributing roughly 30% of the total N loss via denitrification. Spatially representative characterization of nitrification and denitrification in lentic ecosystems requires incorporation of the spatial variation in these transformations with a particular focus on littoral sediments, and this is often overlooked in studies of lentic N cycling. Furthermore, anthropogenic changes to lake shorelines that influence N cycling in littoral sediments may have a disproportionate effect on whole-lake ecosystem function.},

title={Application of magnetic resonance imaging in zoology},
abstract={Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a noninvasive imaging technique that today constitutes one of the main pillars of preclinical and clinical imaging. MRI<e2><80><99>s capacity to depict soft tissue in whole specimens ex vivo as well as in vivo, achievable voxel resolutions well below (100<c2><a0><ce><bc>m)3, and the absence of ionizing radiation have resulted in the broad application of this technique both in human diagnostics and studies involving small animal model organisms. Unfortunately, MRI systems are expensive devices and have so far only sporadically been used to resolve questions in zoology and in particular in zoomorphology. However, the results from two recent studies involving systematic scanning of representative species from a vertebrate group (fishes) as well as an invertebrate taxon (sea urchins) suggest that MRI could in fact be used more widely in zoology. Using novel image data derived from representative species of numerous higher metazoan clades in combination with a comprehensive literature survey, we review and evaluate the potential of MRI for systematic taxon scanning. According to our results, numerous animal groups are suitable for systematic MRI scanning, among them various cnidarian and arthropod taxa, brachiopods, various molluscan taxa, echinoderms, as well as all vertebrate clades. However, various phyla in their entirety cannot be considered suitable for this approach mainly due to their small size (e.g., Kinorhyncha) or their unfavorable shape (e.g., Nematomorpha), while other taxa are prone to produce artifacts associated either with their biology (e.g., Echiura) or their anatomy (e.g., Polyplacophora). In order to initiate further uses of MRI in zoology, we outline the principles underlying various applications of this technique such as the use of contrast agents, in vivo MRI, functional MRI, as well as magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Finally, we discuss how future technical developments might shape the use of MRI for the study of zoological specimens.},

title={Cyanotoxins: Bioaccumulation and Effects on Aquatic Animals},
abstract={Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic prokaryotes with wide geographic distribution that can produce secondary metabolites named cyanotoxins. These toxins can be classified into three main types according to their mechanism of action in vertebrates: hepatotoxins, dermatotoxins and neurotoxins. Many studies on the effects of cyanobacteria and their toxins over a wide range of aquatic organisms, including invertebrates and vertebrates, have reported acute effects (e.g., reduction in survivorship, feeding inhibition, paralysis), chronic effects (e.g., reduction in growth and fecundity), biochemical alterations (e.g., activity of phosphatases, GST, AChE, proteases), and behavioral alterations. Research has also focused on the potential for bioaccumulation and transferring of these toxins through the food chain. Although the herbivorous zooplankton is hypothesized as the main target of cyanotoxins, there is not unquestionable evidence of the deleterious effects of cyanobacteria and their toxins on these organisms. Also, the low toxin burden in secondary consumers points towards biodilution of microcystins in the food web as the predominant process. In this broad review we discuss important issues on bioaccumulation and the effects of cyanotoxins, with emphasis on microcystins, as well as drawbacks and future needs in this field of research.},

abstract={The capacity for long-distance dispersal is an important factor in determining the spread of invasive species. For algae, positive buoyancy generally is correlated with increased dispersal potential, and the light environment has been previously identified as a possible determinant of buoyancy in several species. We examined the effect of light intensity on the buoyancy of fragments of the invasive green alga Codium fragile ssp. fragile. Under natural and controlled conditions, the buoyancy of samples taken from the thallus tip was higher than those from near the holdfast. Both laboratory and field experiments also showed that buoyancy was dynamic and switched from positive to negative under reduced light intensity, but this change required several days. We also observed seasonal changes in buoyancy, presumably due to natural variations in light intensity, with the buoyancy of fragments washed up on the shore highest in mid-summer. These results show that buoyancy is a dynamic property of the C. fragile ssp. fragile thallus and suggest that buoyant fragments contribute to long-range dispersal and accelerated regional spread of this invader. This finding suggests that dispersal is more likely during conditions of high light intensity and illustrates the need to understand how variations in the natural environment can affect the dispersal potential of invasive species.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={The present work integrates the active biomonitoring (ABM) concept in mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis from the South coast of Portugal transplanted during 28<c2><a0>days between two sites with different sources of contamination, and vice versa, in order to assess biological effects in these mussels. For that purpose a multibiomarker approach was used. The suit of biomarkers indicative of metal contamination were metallothioneins (MT) and the enzyme <ce><b4>-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD), for organic contamination mixed function oxidase system (MFO), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE), as oxidative stress biomarkers superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and lipid peroxidation (LPO). These biomarkers were used to determine an index to evaluate the stress levels in these two sites. Site A is strongly influenced by metallic contamination, with higher Cu, Cr and Pb in M. galloprovinciallis, as well as higher MT levels, antioxidant enzymes activities and LPO concentrations, and lower ALAD activity. In site B organic compounds (PAHs) are prevalent and native mussels show higher activities of the MFO system components and GST. Transplanted mussels had significant alterations in some biomarkers that reflect the type of contaminants present in each site, which demonstrates the primary role of the environment in determining the physiological characteristics of resident mussels. Therefore the application of ABM using a battery of biomarkers turns out to be a useful approach in sites where usually complex mixtures of contaminants occurs. In this study the biomarkers that better differentiate the impact of different contaminants at each site were MT, CYP450, SOD and CAT.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Issue Title: Special Issue: Mercury in the Great Lakes The risk of mercury (Hg) exposure to humans and wildlife from fish consumption has driven extensive mercury analysis throughout the Great Lakes Region since the 1970s. This study compiled fish-Hg data from multiple sources in the region and assessed spatiotemporal trends of Hg concentrations in two representative top predator fish species. Walleye (Sander vitreus) and largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) were chosen for the trend analysis because they had more Hg records (63,872) than other fish species that had been sampled from waters throughout the region. Waterbody types were inland lakes (70%), the Great Lakes, impoundments, and rivers. The compiled datasets were analyzed with a mixed effects statistical model having random effects of station, year, and fish length; and fixed effects of year, tissue type, fish length, habitat, and season. The results showed a generally declining temporal trend in fish-Hg for the region (1970-2009), with spatial trends of increasing Hg concentration from south to north and from west to east across the region. Nonlinearity was evident in the general downward trends of Ontario walleye, with a shift to an upward trend beginning in the 1990s. Only ongoing monitoring can reveal if this upward shift is an oscillation in a long-term decline, a statistical anomaly, or a sustained declining temporal trend in regional fish-Hg concentrations.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Issue Title: Special Issue: Mercury in the Great Lakes Mercury (Hg) contamination is widespread in the Laurentian Great Lakes region and is a serious environmental concern. In anaerobic environments such as lake sediments, mercury is transformed into methylmercury (MeHg) and can biomagnify up the food chain to toxic concentrations. The Great Lakes Fish Monitoring Program (GLFMP), administered by the US EPA Great Lakes National Program Office (GLNPO), aims to monitor temporal trends of mercury in the five Great Lakes using top predator fish as biomonitors. Total Hg (THg) concentrations were measured in Great Lake fish collected between 1999 and 2009. Single factor ANOVA determined that average fish THg concentrations over this time period in the five lakes were significantly different from one another in the order of Superior<c2><a0>><c2><a0>Huron<c2><a0>><c2><a0>Michigan<c2><a0>><c2><a0>Ontario<c2><a0>><c2><a0>Erie. By fitting the data to three different models (linear, quadratic, and two-segment piecewise), it was determined that Hg concentrations in top predator fish (lake trout, or walleye in Lake Erie) are currently increasing in Lake Erie and the Apostle Island sampling site in Lake Superior. Significant decreasing trends are evident in Lakes Michigan, Ontario, and the Rockport sampling site in Lake Huron, although all of the lakes exhibit elevated concentrations in fish compared to historic concentrations. As new Hg emission controls are implemented in the US, continued monitoring of Hg in Great Lakes fish will be needed to determine if they influence the current concentrations and trends.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Large (fivefold) differences in CHLa were observed with highest concentrations in the Upper Mississippi (32.3<c2><a0><c2><b1><c2><a0>1.8<c2><a0><ce><bc>g<c2><a0>L^sup -1^), intermediate values in the Missouri (19.7<c2><a0><c2><b1><c2><a0>1.1<c2><a0><ce><bc>g<c2><a0>L^sup -1^) and lowest concentrations in the Ohio (6.8<c2><a0><c2><b1><c2><a0>0.5<c2><a0><ce><bc>g L^sup -1^). Inter-annual variation was small in comparison to inter-river differences suggesting that basin-specific factors exert greater control over river-wide CHLa than regional-scale processes influencing climate and discharge. The rivers were characterized by variable but generally low light conditions as indicated by depth-averaged underwater irradiance <4<c2><a0>E<c2><a0>m^sup -2^<c2><a0>day^sup -1^ and high ratios of channel depth to euphotic depth (>3). Despite poor light conditions, regression analyses revealed that TP was the best single predictor of CHLa (R ^sup 2^<c2><a0>=<c2><a0>0.40), though models incorporating both light and TP performed better (R ^sup 2^<c2><a0>=<c2><a0>0.60). Light and nutrient conditions varied widely within rivers and were inversely related, suggesting that riverine phytoplankton may experience shifts in resource limitation during transport. Inferred grazing and sedimentation losses were large yet CHLa concentrations did not decline downriver indicating that growth and loss processes were closely coupled. The contribution by algae to suspended particulate organic matter in these rivers (mean<c2><a0>=<c2><a0>41%) was similar to that of lakes (39%) but lower relative to reservoirs (61%).[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Relationship between element concentrations and body size in the Lake Maggiore population of Unio pictorum mancus (Mollusca, Bivalvia)},
abstract={The study focused on using a fresh-water mussel (Unio pictorum mancus) as a bioindicator of various pollutants, and particularly metals. The elements considered were: Al, As, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, V and Zn. This research was carried out at a site where various other studies have been conducted on important characteristics of the same population of Unio. This site is a small bay called "Sabbie d<e2><80><99>Oro" located on the south-east coast of Lake Maggiore. Our study involved quantifying the capacity of this mollusc to concentrate large amounts of metal in its body without evident consequences by using detoxification mechanisms. We analysed not only element concentrations, but also their variability (expressed as CV%) in the soft tissues and in the shell, for two main reasons: i) the sampling design should include a preliminary analysis to determine how many specimens is necessary collect to ensure a specified level of precision; ii) the sample variability value may be combined with the value of analytical precision (BCR) to obtain an estimate of the "experimental" precision. In soft tissue, Ca accumulation tended to increase with size, and Al accumulation decreased with size. In shell, Ca and Ni were stored more than in soft tissue, but not proportionally to size. V, Cr and Mo tended to accumulate in the shell progressively over the years, whereas Co and Al are "diluted" during growth, or are absorbed mainly during the juvenile stage. Partition between shell and soft tissue resulted roughly the same in the juvenile and adult stages for the following elements: Fe, Al, Co, As, Pb. The relationships among the various elements were schematized in a hierarchical tree plot.},

abstract={Preinvasion baseline data on entire communities are absent for most taxa in most places, and this limits our ability to connect long-term ecological changes to particular invasive species or invasion events. We obtained data on forest understory composition from 94 stands in the 1950s and again the 2000s. We recorded within-stand frequency of occurrence for garlic mustard, European buckthorn, and Bell's honeysuckle and identified changes in native plant species density in 20, 1-m^sup 2^ quadrats in invaded and noninvaded stands. All three invasive species were absent from all study sites 50 yr ago, yet at least one was present in 77.7% of the stands by the 2000s. All three species were present in 14.9% of the stands. Garlic mustard and European buckthorn were found at 47.9% of resurveyed sites, and Bell's honeysuckle was found in 40.4% of resurveyed sites. Native understory plant species density declined an average of 23.1% during the past 50 yr. Declines were not significantly different in stands with or without invasive plants. The absence of a measurable effect by invasive plant presence or frequency could be due to invasive plants being too few to have a measurable effect at the plot scale, species density being an insensitive response variable, time lags between invasions and effects, or regional factors like development pressure and fire suppression driving density declines in both invasives and native species.

title={Longshore Sediment Movement and Supply along the U.S. Shoreline of Lake Erie},
abstract={To establish existing conditions for dredge material beneficial use projects and to help implement principles of Regional Sediment Management (RSM) into projects and studies, this paper is an assessment of sediment sources and sinks, physical processes, and longshore sediment transport along the west and south shore of Lake Erie. This summary compiles information from a widely scattered technical literature and synthesizes the results in preparation for development of a sediment budget. The U.S. shore of Lake Erie has 28 river or harbor mouths protected with jetties and structures, of which 16 are Federal navigation projects. Much of the sediment management since the mid-1800s has revolved around providing safe navigation, maintaining depth in navigation channels, and disposing of the dredged material. Sediment sources include material brought down the rivers (often fine-grained); industrial dumping and runoff from sewers, gravel, sand, and clay eroded from glacial till bluffs and clay banks; sediment created in situ from bedrock bluff weathering (primarily from shale); and limited supply from lake bed lowering and offshore outcrops. Losses include wave- and ice-induced transport to deep water, sediment trapped in fillets at harbor jetties, sediment dredged from harbor entrance channel and placed in confined disposal facilities (CDFs) or placed offshore, bluff armoring, and (formerly) beach mining. Today, the south shore of Lake Erie is severely sand-starved compared with conditions that existed 200 years ago. The lack of available sediment is largely due to man-made causes. As the shore developed and became urbanized after the mid-1800s, residents, industries, and municipalities attempted to arrest bluff erosion with the use of structures and vegetation. Now the U.S. shoreline of Lake Erie is almost 83% protected, a larger percentage than any ocean coast except in urban areas. It means that little sediment exchange occurs compared with predeveloped conditions, which, in turn, means that managers must recycle and reuse existing sediment to maintain recreation beaches. Managing sediment to benefit a region sustainably potentially will save money, allow use of natural processes to solve engineering problems, and improve recreation resources and natural habitat.

title={Land Use and Basin Characteristics Determine the Composition and Abundance of the Microzooplankton},
abstract={The influence of watershed land use on microzooplankton was examined. Six rivers and a shallow lake located in rural (agriculture, livestock) and urban areas were sampled during 4<c2><a0>weeks at low water, low temperatures and 3<c2><a0>weeks at high water, high temperatures. The major aim of this study was to analyze the composition, richness and abundance of the microzooplankton in relation to land use, taking into account nutrient concentration, biological oxygen demand (BOD^sub 5^), conductivity, pH, transparency, dissolved oxygen, and chlorophyll-a. Redundancy analysis was used to assess microzooplankton response to environmental gradients. The composition and abundance can be considered good indicators of the land used and characteristic of the basin (broad range of conductivity water). The species composition show a gradient along the conductivity, pH and chlorophyll-a. Brachionus spp. were associated with saline waters on rural area and Keratella spp. (except Keratella tropica) were associated with urban water bodies. The microzooplankton abundance diminished by a factor of ten from the rivers in livestock-agriculture-dominated watersheds to those located in strictly urban areas. Urban rivers had low abundances of chlorophyll-a and microzooplankton despite the high concentration of nutrients. However, the effect of urbanization (mesotrophic/mesosaprobious state and lead presence) cannot be analyzed alone due to the potential effect of a filter-feeding invasive mollusk that colonizes the hard surfaces of harbor buildings and bridge pillars.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Estuaries are marine areas at great contamination risk due to their hydrodynamic features. PAH are wide and ubiquitous contaminants with a high presence in these marine environments. Chemical analysis of sediments can provide information, although it does not give a direct measure of the toxicological effect of such contaminants in the biota. Samples of Venerupis pullastra, Cerastoderma edule, and Mytilus galloprovincialis were collected from two locations in Corcubi<c3><b3>n estuary (Norhwest of Spain). The level of PAH in sediment and biota, and its possible origin were assessed. A moderate level of contamination was observed with a predominance of PAH of a pyrogenic origin. Genotoxic damage, measured as single-strand DNA breaks with the comet assay, was evaluated in gill tissue and in hemolymph. The values of DNA damage obtained showed a higher sensitivity of clams and cockles to the pollution load level. These differences among species make us suggest the use of some other species coupled with mussels as an optimal tool for biomonitoring estuarine environments.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Review on Methods for Determination of Metallothioneins in Aquatic Organisms},
abstract={One aspect of environmental degradation in coastal areas is pollution from toxic metals, which are persistent and are bioaccumulated by marine organisms, with serious public health implications. A conventional monitoring system of environmental metal pollution includes measuring the level of selected metals in the whole organism or in respective organs. However, measuring only the metal content in particular organs does not give information about its effect at the subcellular level. Therefore, the evaluation of biochemical biomarker metallothionein may be useful in assessing metal exposure and the prediction of potential detrimental effects induced by metal contamination. There are some methods for the determination of metallothioneins including spectrophotometric method, electrochemical methods, chromatography, saturation-based methods, immunological methods, electrophoresis, and RT-PCR. In this paper, different methods are discussed briefly and the comparison between them will be presented.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Calculated hypolimnetic oxygen depletion (HOD) rates depend not only on environmental factors but also logistical ones. In particular, lack of understanding of the effects of weather in addition to how sampling effort determines calculated HOD rates complicates ecological understanding and environmental management of lake ecosystems. To better determine the roles of weather and sampling effort, we combined (1) weekly measurements of temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations from seven stations in the Sandusky subbasin of Lake Erie's central basin during 2005, (2) contemporaneous measures of storm activity and tributary discharge, and (3) a two-dimensional coupled hydrodynamic, chemical, and biological model of Lake Erie to investigate (1) how increased storm activity and tributary discharge affected short- (daily) and long-term (seasonal) dynamics of hypolimnetic hypoxia, and (2) how spatial (number of sites sampled) and temporal (sampling frequency) sampling effort affected calculated HOD rates. Our model closely replicated field-observed DO dynamics. When comparing baseline modeled dynamics to those in a second simulation with twice the number of days with high winds, however, we found that with more storm activity (1) periods of entrainment became more frequent, (2) the hypolimnion was warmer, (3) thermal stratification occurred 1<c2><a0>month later, whereas autumnal turnover occurred at least 1<c2><a0>week earlier shortening the duration of stratification by 1-2<c2><a0>months, and (4) HOD rates increased 12%. Further, spatial and temporal sampling intensity also affected calculated HOD rates. Consequently, adequately quantifying actual HOD rates requires sufficient sampling effort and the particular role of weather should be assessed with rigorous field and simulation studies, especially if HOD rates are used to indicate management success.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Parasite-mediated intraguild predation as one of the drivers of co-existence and exclusion among invasive and native amphipods (Crustacea)},
abstract={Parasitism is emerging as one of the forces determining the outcome of biological invasions. Using field survey and laboratory experiments, we investigate parasitism as one of the factors mediating the interactions among invasive and native amphipods. An extensive survey (100 sites) of a small British island, revealed the native Gammarus duebeni celticus to be parasitised by the muscle wasting microsporidian Pleistophora mulleri and the acanthocephalan duck parasite Polymorphus minutus, the introduced European Gammarus pulex only by P. minutus and the North American Crangonyx pseudogracilis by neither. While Gammarus spp. were widespread in rivers (one or both species present in 64% of sites), C. pseudogracilis had a restricted distribution (7% of sites) and always co-occurred with Gammarus spp. In contrast, Gammarus spp. were absent from all pond/reservoir sites, with C. pseudogracilis present in over 90%. While the negative association of C. pseudogracilis with Gammarus spp. undoubtedly results from factors such as physico-chemical tolerance and predation as C. pseudogracilis can be heavily predated by Gammarus spp., it was notable that C. pseudogracilis co-occurred with Gammarus spp. more frequently when the latter were parasitised. Laboratory experiments clearly showed that predation on C. pseudogracilis was greatly diminished when G. d. celticus was parasitised by P. mulleri and G. pulex by P. minutus. Our study provides evidence that parasitism, by mediating a key interspecific interaction, is one of an array of interacting factors that may have a role in driving patterns of exclusion and co-existence in natives and invaders.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={This study assessed metals in water and different tissues of Labeo rohita and the impact of these metals on DNA and proteins as biomarkers of gills and muscles of these fish from three different polluted sites (reference or low = KW, medium = CH and high = SK) of the Indus River, Pakistan. The Mn, Pb, Cu, Zn, Hg, and Cr levels in water, gills, liver, muscles, and skin of these fish were compared with the international permissible levels. All metals except Pb and Hg in water were within the acceptable limits of drinking water. In contrast, the Mn, Hg, and Cr levels in the fish tissues were higher than their permissible limits for fish as a human food. Here, the gills contained higher metals than the other tissues. Different patterns of biomarkers were found in fish from these sites. While the gills did not show four protein bands (55, 30, 18.4, and 16.4<c2><a0>kDa), the muscles showed four new protein bands (100, 85, 45, and 20<c2><a0>kDa) for fish from the medium and high polluted sites as compared to the reference or low polluted site. The fish from the CH and SK sites of the Indus River contained low molecular weight DNA in their gills but high molecular weight DNA in their muscles when compared with the KW site. This study suggests that the proteins and DNA profiles of L. rohita could be used as biomarkers to assess the impact of potential environmental stressors such as metals on the freshwater systems.

title={Estimating benthic invertebrate production in lakes: a comparison of methods and scaling from individual taxa to the whole-lake level},
abstract={Studies of aquatic invertebrate production have been primarily conducted at the level of individual taxa or populations. Advancing our understanding of the functioning and energy flow in aquatic ecosystems necessitates scaling-up to community and whole-lake levels, as well as integrating across benthic and pelagic habitats and across multiple trophic levels. In this paper, we compare a suite of non-cohort based methods for estimating benthic invertebrate production at subpopulation, habitat, and whole-lake levels for Sparkling Lake, WI, USA. Estimates of the overall mean benthic invertebrate production (i.e. whole-lake level) ranged from 1.9 to 5.0<c2><a0>g<c2><a0>DM<c2><a0>m^sup -2^<c2><a0>y^sup -1^, depending on the method. Production estimates varied widely among depths and habitats, and there was general qualitative agreement among methods with regards to differences in production among habitats. However, there were also consistent and systematic differences among methods. The size-frequency method gave the highest, while the regression model of Banse and Mosher (Ecol Monogr 50:355-379, 1980) gave the lowest production estimates. The regression model of Plante and Downing (Can J Fish Aquat Sci 46:1489-1498, 1989) had the lowest average coefficients of variation at habitat (CV<c2><a0>=<c2><a0>0.17) and whole-lake (CV<c2><a0>=<c2><a0>0.08) levels. At the habitat level, variance in production estimates decreased with sampling effort, with little improvement after 10-15 samples. Our study shows how different production estimates can be generated from the same field data, though aggregating estimates up to the whole-lake level does produce an averaging effect that tends to reduce variance.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Naturally occurring stable isotope and trace elemental markers in otoliths have emerged as powerful tools for determining natal origins and environmental history of fishes in a variety of marine and freshwater environments. However, few studies have examined the applicability of this technique in large river-floodplain ecosystems. This study evaluated otolith microchemistry and stable isotopic composition as tools for determining environmental history of fishes in the Middle Mississippi River, its tributaries, and floodplain lakes in Illinois and Missouri, USA. Fishes were collected from 14 sites and water samples obtained from 16 sites during summer and fall 2006 and spring 2007. Otolith and water samples were analyzed for stable oxygen isotopic composition (<ce><b4>^sup 18^O) and concentrations of a suite of trace elements; otoliths were also analyzed for carbon isotopic composition (<ce><b4>^sup 13^C). Tributaries, floodplain lakes, and the Mississippi and Lower Missouri Rivers possessed distinct isotopic and elemental signatures that were reflected in fish otoliths. Fish from tributaries on the Missouri and Illinois sides of the middle Mississippi River could also be distinguished from one another by their elemental and isotopic fingerprints. Linear discriminant function analysis of otolith chemical signatures indicated that fish could be classified back to their environment of capture (Mississippi River, floodplain lake, tributary on the Illinois or Missouri side of the Mississippi River, or lower Missouri River) with 71-100% accuracy. This study demonstrates the potential applicability of otolith microchemistry and stable isotope analyses to determine natal origins and describe environmental history of fishes in the Middle Mississippi River, its tributaries, and floodplain lakes. The ability to reconstruct environmental history of individual fish using naturally occurring isotopic markers in otoliths may also facilitate efforts to quantify nutrient and energy subsidies to the Mississippi River provided by fishes that emigrate from floodplain lakes or tributaries.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Survivorship of 6 ? 2 mm and 20 ? 2 mm mussels acclimated to 12, 23 and 28?C and subjected to different heating rates (1?C per 5, 15 and 30 min) was estimated in the laboratory. The temperatures required to kill 50% (LT50) and 100% (SM100) of the mussels, and the mean death temperature (MDT) varied between 42.2 and 51?C over 54 experiments. Heating rates significantly (p < 0.001) affected LT50, SM100, and MDT. AULT was not affected by mussel size and acclimation temperatures. Limnoperna appears to be more resistant to high temperatures than Dreissena polymorpha, a mussel invasive in the USA and Europe. Lethal temperatures of L. fortunei are within the current thermal operational industrial capacities, suggesting that heat treatment is a viable alternative for controlling its fouling in utility systems.},

abstract={Annual mean salinity, light availability, and sediment depth to bedrock structured the submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) communities in subtropical mangrove-lined estuaries. Three distinct SAV communities (i.e., Chara group, Halodule group, and Low SAV coverage group) were identified along the Everglades-Florida Bay ecotone and related to water quality using a discriminant function model that predicted the type of plant community at a given site from salinity, light availability, and sediment depth to bedrock. Mean salinity alone was able to correctly classify 78% of the sites and reliably separated the Chara group from the Halodule group. The addition of light availability and sediment depth to bedrock increased model accuracy to 90% and further distinguished the Chara group from the Halodule group. Light availability was uniquely valuable in separating the Chara group from the Low SAV coverage group. Regression analyses identified significant relationships between phosphorus concentration, phytoplankton abundance, and light availability and suggest that a decline in water transparency, associated with increasing salinity, may have also contributed to the historical decline of Chara communities in the region. This investigation applies relationships between environmental variables and SAV distribution and provides a case study into the application of these general principals to ecosystem management.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

The data were statistically compared for the main effects of the site and fish organs and their interaction on the bioaccumulation pattern of these metals in fish organs at P<0.05. It appeared that the fish sampled from downstream had higher trace metals than the fish from upstream. Significant differences between fish organs were observed for these trace metals (P<0.001). The fish showed higher bioaccumulation of vital metals like Zn and lower bioaccumulation for the toxic metals like Pb. The gills had the highest metal load followed by liver, skin and muscles. High concentrations of Mn, Hg and Cr were observed in different fish organs as compared to the WHO and Federal Environmental Protection Agency standards for food fish. However, the mean concentration of Pb and Zn were under the permissible limits of food fish. It implies that higher levels of Mn, Hg and Cr in fish muscles would have detrimental effects on the health of fish consumers such as pregnant women, children and elderly people of this study area.

title={A phylogenetic and morphologic context for the radiation of an endemic fauna in a long-lived lake: Corbulidae (Bivalvia; Myoida) in the Miocene Pebas Formation of western Amazonia},
abstract={The Corbulidae are one of a handful of a primarily marine bivalve clades that exhibit a remarkable radiation, marked by increased species richness and divergent morphologies, within a long-lived lake. For corbulids, this diversification occurred within the lower to middle Miocene Pebas Formation of western Amazonia. Only one taxon associated with this radiation (Anticorbula) remains extant. We conducted a series of phylogenetic analyses to characterize diversification of Corbulidae within the Pebas Formation and relate that diversification to geologically older freshwater corbulids from the Paleocene Fort Union Formation of the northern Great Plains (United States). We used these results, as well as a quantitative examination of morphospace occupation, to infer whether Pebasian corbulids represent a true species flock, and whether the lacustrine system represented by the Pebas Formation represents a cradle of, or reservoir for, freshwater corbulid diversity. We conducted two sets of phylogenetic analyses using shell morphology characters. A genus-level data set incorporated type species of freshwater corbulid genera, any Paleocene representatives of these genera, and selected brackish and marine corbulid genera. A species-level analysis added all described freshwater corbulid taxa to the genus-level matrix. Our results were highly resolved (few most-parsimonious trees), but not particularly robust (low branch support). For the genus-level matrix, we used a taxon jackknife procedure to explore the effects of taxon sampling on tree stability and topology. Jackknife results recover a subclade of freshwater taxa (including both Anticorbula and Pachydon species and the Paleocene Ostomya sp.) in 92.4% of trees, although placement of this subclade across the ingroup varies, as do the topologic positions of other freshwater species. Freshwater and marine corbulids also are morphologically distinct from each other, a factor that likely reduced the robustness of our phylogenetic results. By combining these results with paleoecologic, stratigraphic, and morphologic data, we infer that freshwater corbulids arose once within the family, prior to the Cenozoic, with three distinct freshwater lineages present at their first appearance in the late Paleocene of North America. Within the Miocene Pebas system of South America, we reconstruct supralimital morphologic evolution within three lineages as freshwater taxa became variously adapted to the fluid, dysoxic muds characterizing lake-bottom facies representative of the Pebas lacustrine system. In addition, corbulids apparently successfully coped with high predation pressures from co-occurring shellcrushing predators. Finally, we consider that freshwater Corbulidae were primarily fluvial taxa throughout their geologic history, with a relatively ephemeral radiation within the Pebasian lake system, thus making the Pebasian system a cradle of diversity for several corbulid lineages.

title={Mercury accumulation in caged Corbicula: rate of uptake and seasonal variation},
abstract={The uptake and seasonal fluctuations of total mercury were followed in caged and uncaged Asiatic clams, Corbicula fluminea, over a 1-year period in South River, Virginia. Mercury was rapidly accumulated in clams transplanted from a nominally uncontaminated site into cages on the contaminated South River, reaching 0.99<c2><a0><ce><bc>g g^sup -1^ dry mass within the first month. Resident clams moved to cages had higher mercury contents after the first month (2.04<c2><a0><ce><bc>g g^sup -1^ dry mass) and at all subsequent times in the study. Large monthly fluctuations in mercury were noted for both resident caged and transplant caged clams with a notable peak occurring in early spring (4.31<c2><a0><ce><bc>g g^sup -1^ dry mass in resident caged clams). Tissue mass of caged clams steadily increased through the winter and early spring. Adjustment of mercury concentrations for tissue mass changes indicated that the changes in mercury contents were primarily due to uptake/release rather than changes in tissue mass (concentration/dilution). The present study demonstrates the utility of using caged Corbicula as mercury biomonitors and illustrates the importance of accounting for large, short-term changes of mercury content in Corbicula when designing long-term biomonitoring studies.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Bivalves filter and accumulate large numbers of microorganisms present in the harvesting water. A complete understanding of the balance between Anodonta cygnea and the microbiota present in their surrounding environment remains incomplete. Therefore, the aim of this study was to quantify and identify the indigenous bacteria in the biological fluids of A. cygnea collected from Mira Lagoon in northern Portugal. The results showed Vibrio metschnikovii and Aeromonas sobria as the dominant groups. The median for total bacteria from mucus was 3.1<c3><97>10^sup 3^CFU<c2><a0>g^sup -1^, whereas the range in means from fluids was 1.5<c3><97>10^sup 2^ to 6.5<c3><97>10^sup 2^CFU<c2><a0>ml^sup -1^. During the experimental work, Escherichia coli and enterococci were not detected in healthy A. cygnea. However, the periodic detection of E. coli and enterococci in Mira lagoon revealed its presence in the water. Our observations suggest that A. cygnea has the ability to filter and eliminate E. coli, present in the surrounding environment, through an active phagocytic process conducted by hemolymph circulating cells, the hemocytes.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={The aim of this investigation was to identify major pesticides that may cause detrimental effects in bivalve species affected by agricultural pollution. Investigations were carried out using freshwater clams (Corbicula fluminea) transplanted in the main drainage channels that collect the effluents coming from agriculture fields in the Ebro Delta (NE Spain) during the main growing season of rice (from May to August). Environmental hazards were assessed by measuring simultaneous up 46 contaminant levels and 9 biomarker responses. Measured biological responses showed marked differences across sites and months. Antioxidant and esterase enzyme responses were in most cases inhibited. Lipid peroxidation levels increased steadily from May in upstream stations to August in drainage channels. Principal Component (PCA) and Partial Least Squares to Latent Structure regression (PLS) analyses allowed the identification of endosulfan, propanil, and phenylureas as being the chemical contaminants causing the most adverse effects in the studied species.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Oil pollution increases plasma antioxidants but reduces coloration in a seabird},
abstract={It has been suggested that condition-dependent signals may be a useful measure of environmental quality. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that oil pollution enhances oxidative stress and impairs expression of a carotenoid-based signal in a wild population of the yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis). During the courtship period, a group of gulls were fed a supplementary diet containing heavy fuel oil from the Prestige oil spill and were compared with control gulls fed a similar supplementary diet without fuel oil. Blood levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, the most toxic components of crude oils, were higher (30%) in the Prestige oil-fed gulls than in the control gulls. Plasma concentrations of vitamin E and carotenoids were also significantly higher in the Prestige oil-fed gulls (31 and 27%, respectively). Although, the plasma levels of lipid peroxidation markers were higher (13%) in gulls fed with Prestige oil than in the control gulls, these differences were not significant, possibly because of the small number of gulls analyzed. The red bill spot was significantly smaller (16%) in the oil-fed gulls than in the control individuals. This study provides the first experimental evidence that a carotenoid-based signal in a free-living seabird is affected by exposure to oil pollution and is hence indicative of environmental quality. Since the yellow-legged gull belongs to a complex of species widely distributed throughout the northern hemisphere, the method described may constitute a useful tool for evaluating sub-lethal effects of oil spills in seabirds.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Potential Effects of an Invasive Nitrogen-Fixing Tree on a Hawaiian Stream Food Web1},
abstract={Falcataria moluccana (albizia) is an exotic nitrogen (N)-fixing tree currently invading riparian forests in Hawai'i, U.S.A. This study examined how this invasion is impacting stream ecosystems by using naturally occurring stable isotopes of carbon (C) and N to compare food web structure between a noninvaded and an albizia-invaded stream reach on the island of Hawai'i. Isotopic signatures of particulate organic matter (POM), macroalgae, invertebrates, and fishes were collected and compared between the two stream reaches. Stable C isotopic signatures of organic matter sources (POM and macroalgae) and consumers (amphipods, caddisflies, crayfish, and fishes) from the invaded site were depleted in ^sup 13^C compared with the noninvaded site. In contrast, all samples from the invaded site were enriched in ^sup 15^N compared with the noninvaded site. Results from IsoSource and two-source mixing models suggested that albizia was a major contributor to diets of lower-level consumers within the invaded site, displacing POM and macroalgae as their major food sources. Albizia was also an indirect C and N source for higher-level consumers within the invaded site because albizia was the major dietary constituent of their prey. In addition, ^sup 15^N enrichment of the macroalgae at the invaded site suggests that albizia may be an important N source to benthic primary producers and could be further altering the food web from bottom up. Our study provides some of the first evidence that invasive riparian N-fixing trees can potentially alter the structure of stream food webs. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={An evaluation of different methods for transportation of the freshwater mussel Lamellidens corrianus (Lea 1834)},
abstract={The freshwater mussel Lamellidens corrianus (Lea 1834) is widely distributed in ponds and large bodies of perennial waters in the Indian subcontinent. It is one of the important species for producing freshwater pearls in India. As the freshwater pearl aquaculture activity may expand on wide scale in future, it may require collecting L. corrianus from the distant places and transport to pearl producing centres. Hence, in order to develop suitable method for transportation of L. corrianus to obtain high survival with minimum physiological stress, the present study was conducted. L. corrianus were transported by two different methods i.e. in air (in wet gunny bags) and in water (in plastic polyethylene bags containing water) to find out the best method for transportation. Glucose was chosen as the stress factor as the heightened circulating glucose levels may reflect the bivalve's ability to respond to weather extremes, handling stress or any recent environmental stress perceived to require extra energy. Experiments were conducted both under field as well as laboratory conditions, during the start of winter season, where regional temperature falls to 4-5<c2><b0>C below the average. Under the field experiment, L. corrianus (total length<c2><a0>=<c2><a0>8.26<c2><a0><c2><b1><c2><a0>0.34<c2><a0>cm; wet weight<c2><a0>=<c2><a0>52.62<c2><a0><c2><b1><c2><a0>3.18<c2><a0>g) were transported by road from Khopoli (Dist. Raigad, Maharashtra State) to Ratnagiri (Dist. Ratnagiri, Maharashtra State) for 12<c2><a0>h in air and water (reservoir water temperature<c2><a0>=<c2><a0>26.4<c2><b0>C). Under laboratory conditions, simulating air transportation was done in wet gunny bags (42.5<c2><a0>cm<c2><a0><c3><97><c2><a0>62.5<c2><a0>cm), each bag containing 50 mussels (total length<c2><a0>=<c2><a0>8.34<c2><a0><c2><b1><c2><a0>0.46<c2><a0>cm; wet weight<c2><a0>=<c2><a0>53.2<c2><a0><c2><b1><c2><a0>3.24<c2><a0>g). Simulating water transportation was carried out using plastic polyethylene bags (45<c2><a0>cm<c2><a0><c3><97><c2><a0>60<c2><a0>cm), with 50 mussels in five litres of water (water temperature<c2><a0>=<c2><a0>26.5<c2><b0>C). At periodical intervals, glucose concentrations from mantle, gill and posterior adductor muscle were estimated. Under both field and laboratory conditions, glucose levels were significantly higher in mantle, gill and posterior adductor muscle tissue of L. corrianus transported in air when compared to that of water-transported mussels. Results showed that air transportation was comparatively more stressful than water transportation. However, cent per cent survival was obtained in the both methods just after transportation and after 7<c2><a0>days of transportation. Considering the absence of mortality in both methods, it can be concluded that the choice of the mussel transportation method is more economical dependent than biological dependent.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Multivariate analysis including correlation, multiple stepwise linear regression, and cluster analyses were applied to investigate the heavy metal concentrations (Cd, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb, and Zn) in the different parts of bivalves and gastropods. It was also aimed to distinguish statistically the differences between the marine bivalves and the gastropods with regards to the accumulation of heavy metals in the different tissues. The different parts of four species of bivalves and four species of gastropods were obtained and analyzed for heavy metals. The multivariate analyses were then applied on the data. From the multivariate analyses conducted, there were correlations found between the soft tissues of bivalves and gastropods, but none was found between the shells and the soft tissues of most of the molluscs (except for Cerithidea obtusa and Puglina cochlidium). The significant correlations (P < 0.05) found between the soft tissues were further complemented by the multiple stepwise linear regressions where heavy metals in the total soft tissues were influenced by the accumulation in the different types of soft tissues. The present study found that the distributions of heavy metals in the different parts of molluscs were related to their feeding habits and living habitats. The statistical approaches proposed in this study are recommended for use in biomonitoring studies, since multivariate analyses can reduce the cost and time involved in identifying an effective tissue to monitor the heavy metal(s) bioavailability and contamination in tropical coastal waters.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Two amphipods, the hypogean Niphargus stygius and epigean Gammarus fossarum, were analyzed for fatty acid (FA) composition, electron transport system (ETS) activity and respiration (R) during a laboratory fasting experiment. In agreement with ETS and R measurements (and the ETS/R ratio), the hypogean N. stygius utilized FA more slowly than the epigean G. fossarum. Inter-specific differences in the utilization of certain FA during fasting were also revealed. While N. stygius tended to preserve all of its FA during the experimental fasting period, G. fossarum showed a tendency to utilize MUFA (monounsaturated FA) and SAFA (saturated FA) and preferentially retain PUFA (polyunsaturated FA). The significant correlations between ETS activity and composition of specific FA during fasting can be linked to R. During the fasting, both ETS activity and respiration rate of G. fossarum decreased, however, ETS/R ratio increased. In contrast, N. stygius did not show significant changes in these parameters. This is the first report, which connects ETS activity with changes in concentrations of specific FA during fasting. Such evolutionary adaptations of hypogean species enables them to better survive chronically low and/or discontinuous food supplies compared to epigean species, which live in environments where food shortages are much less frequent.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Biotic calcification is rarely considered in freshwater C budgets, despite calculations suggesting that calcifying animals can alter inorganic C cycling. Most studies that have quantified biocalcification in aquatic ecosystems have not directly linked CO^sub 2^ fluxes from biocalcification with whole-ecosystem rates of inorganic C cycling. The freshwater snail, Melanoides tuberculata, has achieved a high abundance and 37.4<c2><a0>g<c2><a0>biomass<c2><a0>m^sup -2^ after invading Kelly Warm Springs in Grand Teton National Park. This high biomass suggests that introduced populations of Melanoides may alter ecosystem processes.

We compared Melanoides biomass and inorganic C production with ecosystem C pools and fluxes, as well as with published rates of CO^sub 2^ production by other calcifying organisms.

This rate of CO^sub 2^ production via biocalcification is within the published range of calcification by animals. But these CO^sub 2^ fluxes are small when compared to ecosystem C fluxes from stream metabolism. The influence of animals is relative to ecosystem processes, and should always be compared with ecosystem fluxes to quantify the importance of a specific animal in its environment.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT] Erratum DOI: 10.1007/s00442-010-1574-8},

This paper reports the effects of stocking density, temperature, and salinity on survival and growth of early larvae before and after feeding, in order to establish conditions for optimal larval growth and production. To maximize the yield per unit of space, densities of 0.5-1 larvae/ml are recommended for non-feeding larvae, while 0.1-0.2 larvae/ml are best for feeding larvae. Higher survival and growth values were obtained for both non-feeding and feeding larvae at temperature ranges from 21 to 24<c2><b0>C. Larvae reared at a salinity of 30[per thousand] always showed maximum growth and survival. Based on results of this study, a temperature range from 21 to 24<c2><b0>C and a salinity of 30 are considered optimal for early development of the red A. japonicus.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Effective treatments of industrial waste streams and toxic spills containing heavy metals related with rapid removal of metal ions at high concentrations. Influences of clearance and absorption rates on two heavy metals (copper and cadmium) by saccustrea cucullata originated from mangrove ecosystem in the Northern Persian Gulf were investigated. Specimens were collected from sub-tidal band during neap tide; groups of 15 individual were placed in 1.5 L containers (2-liter volume), which were immersed in the water. After the acclimation time (i.e. the regulation of filtration activity caused by manipulation and any other sources), specific clearance and absorption performances were measured during alternation of stagnation and flow positions. Temperature, salinity and particle concentrations were maintained. The clearance rate is affected by the amount of cadmium (from 1.69 to 0.04 ml min/g/h AFDW) and copper (from 2.16 ml to 0.42 ml min/g/h AFDW). Although the clearance rate was significantly reduced, live oysters reduced the amount of cadmium and copper from 150 and 200 <c2><b5>g/l to 118.68 and 133.30 <c2><b5>g/l respectively. Oyster had the different clearance rates toward copper and cadmium when simultaneously introduced. The dead shells also had a good ability to reduce the metal condensation. According to the results it can be concluded that Sacostrea cucullata can be used as biofilters with good clearance ability.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to assess environmental quality at some of the sites most severely affected by the Prestige oil spill off 2<c2><a0>years after the spillage (April and November 2004). For this purpose analyses of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and several biochemical (antioxidant enzymes catalase, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and DT-diaphorase and lipid peroxidation) and physiological [scope for growth (SFG)] biomarkers were determined on wild mussel populations (Mytilus galloprovincialis) collected at four points along the Costa da Morte and compared with those of a reference site not affected by the oil spill. Results showed that PAH contents had markedly decreased 17<c2><a0>months after the accident, although they were higher in April than in November, when they showed values similar to background levels reported for this area. Nevertheless, the predominance of chrysene on PAH profiles, similarly to findings obtained immediately after the spill, indicated the Prestige as their main source. In spite of the low PAH levels recorded, antioxidant activity levels (explained through the integrated antioxidant response-IAR) were higher in the Costa da Morte than at the reference site either in April and November. In April IAR seems to be related to PAH levels found 3<c2><a0>months after the accident (February 2003), suggesting the persistence in the environment of oxidative stress-producing components from the spill. However, evidence of oxidative stress was not reflected at physiological level by scope for growth, with only very slight differences being observed between values from the reference site and those from Costa da Morte sites. In conclusion, although 2<c2><a0>years after the spill PAHs bioaccumulated by mussels from the Costa da Morte had decreased to background levels, biochemical parameters showed signals of oxidative stress in mussels from this area. However, SFG reflected a good health status for the mussel populations studied and did not reveal evidence of physiological disturbance either 17 or 24<c2><a0>months after the Prestige spill.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Induction of anti-predator responses in the green-lipped mussel Perna viridis under hypoxia},
abstract={Hypoxia due to the over enrichment of waters by nutrients is becoming a global problem. In mussels, enhanced byssus thread production is an important adaptation to the presence of crustacean predators and to energetic hydrodynamic regimes. Thread production is an energy-consuming process, so this study used the green mussel Perna viridis (L.) to examine the response to predator exposure combined with hypoxia. Hypoxia is common in sheltered bays in Hong Kong, and the mussels were collected in one such bay, Lok Wo Sha (latitude/longitude: 22<c2><b0>18' N/114<c2><b0>10' E) in January, 2009. The predator used in the experiments was the swimming crab Thalamita danae. Oxygen concentrations used in the 48-h experiments ranged from hypoxic to normoxic (1.5 <c2><b1> 0.3 mg l^sup -1^, 3.0 <c2><b1> 0.3 mg l^sup -1^ and 6.0 <c2><b1> 0.3 mg l^sup -1^). Fewer byssus threads which were also shorter and thinner were produced at reduced oxygen levels, no matter if the predator was present or not; the frequency the mussels shed stalks was also lower. Mussels exposed to the predator, however, have enhanced byssus thread production at all oxygen levels when compared with the control. This has highlighted the significance of anti-predator responses for the survival of individuals even under a stressful environment in which energy supply is limited by aerobic metabolism. Interactive effects between oxygen level and predator exposure were observed for the byssus thread production (frequency of shed stalks, mean byssus thread length, cumulative byssus thread volume), with values obtained at 1.5 and 3.0 mg O2 l^sup -1^ being statistically indistinguishable for the control group without predator but not for the predator group. The lack of differences in the byssus thread production at lower oxygen levels in the absence of predator may indicate the minimum amount of byssus that is required for settlement on a substrate.

title={Effects of nonylphenol on a soil community using microcosms},
abstract={Nonylphenol polyethoxylates (NPEOs) are a group of surfactants known to be toxic and able to mimic estrogen compounds and thus interfere with the action of an animal's endogenous hormones. NPEOs are easily biodegraded in the environment, but the last end product, nonylphenol (NP), is the most toxic and recalcitrant form and hence can have a longer half-life in the environment. Despite the fact that most NP is finally degraded, a small fraction may remain in soil for longer periods. In soils, the application of sewage sludge is the main source of NPEOs. The aim of this study is to provide data on the effects of NP on a simplified soil invertebrate community since only a few studies using single-species bioassays are available for terrestrial ecosystems in comparison with aquatic ecosystems. In our study, we assessed the effect of increasing NP concentrations (0, 10, 30, 90, and 270<c2><a0>mg NP kg^sup -1^) in soil microcosms containing a simplified soil community consisting of natural microorganisms, a primary producer (an oat seedling of Avena sativa), several consumers (the isopod Porcellionides sexfasciatus, the enchytraeid Enchytraeus crypticus, and the collembolans Folsomia candida, Ceratophysella (Hypogastrura) denticulata, and Proisotoma minuta), and a predator species (the mite Hypoaspis aculeifer). The effects on the different taxa of the different NP concentrations were assessed over three sampling dates (28, 56, and 112<c2><a0>days) using the principal response curves method. The soil community did not change significantly at concentrations below 90<c2><a0>mg NP kg^sup -1^, which was selected as the nonobserved effect concentration (NOEC). The highest concentration (270<c2><a0>mg NP kg^sup -1^) changed the community significantly after 28 and 56<c2><a0>days, but this effect disappeared after 112<c2><a0>days, in accordance with the known rapid biodegradation of this compound in soil. Taking into account the usual NP concentrations in soils with repeated applications of sludge, the environmental risk of NP to soils seems to be limited because the derived NOEC was clearly above the usual concentrations in soil reported in the literature. However, the use of highly polluted sludges or accidental spillages, together with the possible pollution exportation by runoff to aquatic ecosystems, which are highly sensitive to NP pollution, recommend the careful monitoring of this chemical in the environment.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Environmental Forcing of Phytoplankton in a Mediterranean Estuary (Guadiana Estuary, South-western Iberia): A Decadal Study of Anthropogenic and Climatic Influences},
abstract={Phytoplankton seasonal and interannual variability in the Guadiana upper estuary was analyzed during 1996-2005, a period that encompassed a climatic controlled reduction in river flow that was superimposed on the construction of a dam. Phytoplankton seasonal patterns revealed an alternation between a persistent light limitation and episodic nutrient limitation. Phytoplankton succession, with early spring diatom blooms and summer-early fall cyanobacterial blooms, was apparently driven by changes in nutrients, water temperature, and turbulence, clearly demonstrating the role of river flow and climate variability. Light intensity in the mixed layer was a prevalent driver of phytoplankton interannual variability, and the increased turbidity caused by the Alqueva dam construction was linked to pronounced decreases in chlorophyll a concentration, particularly at the start and end of the phytoplankton growing period. Decreases in annual maximum and average abundances of diatoms, green algae, and cyanobacteria were also detected. Furthermore, chlorophyll a decreases after dam filling and a decrease in turbidity may point to a shift from light limitation towards a more nutrient-limited mode in the near future.

title={Comparison of fish and phantom midge influence on cladocerans diel vertical migration in a dual basin lake},
abstract={Diurnal vertical migrations (DVM) behaviour of cladocerans was investigated in two mesotrophic Irish lakes connected by a canal, characterised by interesting differences in the presence of zooplanktivorous predators. In Doon Upper, fish (mostly juvenile perch and roach) and a little-studied phantom midge Mochlonyx fuliginosus (Chaoboridae) were found, but Doon Lower was solely inhabited by fish. As the presence of diverse predators may alter spatial avoidance behaviour of zooplankton prey in different ways, the aim of this study was to determine whether and how two predator types, fish and phantom midge larvae, have changed DVM pattern of cladocerans during day and night in Doon lakes. Two sampling series of phytoplankton, zooplankton, fish, and water physical analyses were conducted on 09-10 June and 19-20 September 2007 in both lakes. In the study conducted in June, under a similar distribution of M. fuliginosus and juvenile fish in Doon Upper, a reverse migration of Daphnia galeata was observed as a strategy allowing them to avoid both types of predators. However, in September, when M. fuliginosus lived in a 24<c2><a0>h refugium below the oxycline as a response to increasing predation risk posed by YOY fish penetrated the upper strata of water during day and night, reverse migrations of D. galeata were not clear. In Doon Lower, normal migration was observed as an advantageous behavioural response against visual predators (fish), in both large and small Cladocera species: D. galeata, Diaphanosoma branchyurum and Bosmina sp. Thus, our results indicate dissimilar migration patterns of D. galeata depending on the presence of one (Doon Lower) or two predators with different predation behaviour (Doon Upper).[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Prey selection by larvae of Prochilodus lineatus (Pisces: Curimatidae): indigenous zooplankton versus veligers of the introduced bivalve Limnoperna fortunei (Bivalvia: Mitilidae)},
abstract={We studied experimentally the feeding selectivity of larvae of Prochilodus lineatus (Pisces), with particular emphasis on the role of veligers of the exotic bivalve Limnoperna fortunei. Three concentrations of veligers were offered to three developmental stages of P. lineatus. Veliger concentrations were: (1) higher than in the field ("enriched", 0.09<c2><a0>ind.<c2><a0>ml^sup -1^), (2) unmodified from field conditions ("normal", 0.06<c2><a0>ind.<c2><a0>ml^sup -1^), and (3) lower than in the field ("low", 0.02<c2><a0>ind.<c2><a0>ml^sup -1^). Fish developmental stages were protolarvae (approx. 10<c2><a0>days old), mesolarvae (17<c2><a0>days), and metalarvae (25<c2><a0>days). Proportions (in terms of numbers and biomass) and selectivity values were calculated for each prey item evaluated: veligers, small cladocerans<c2><a0>+<c2><a0>nauplii, medium-sized cladocerans, copepodits, and large cladocerans<c2><a0>+<c2><a0>copepods. Protolarvae and mesolarvae consumed veligers almost exclusively (88-90%, both in numbers and in biomass) when offered prey enriched in veligers, whereas for metalarvae veligers represented only 16.0% of the food consumed. At lower veliger concentrations, only protolarvae preferred Limnoperna veligers, whereas older fishes switched gradually to crustacean plankton. We conclude that veligers are preferred by the early fish developmental stages, and we speculate that this may be because their slower swimming makes them easier to capture than planktonic crustaceans. However, as fish larvae grow larger, veligers become too small a prey for their energetic needs, and they switch to larger items like cladocerans and copepods. We anticipate that this new and abundant food resource has an important impact on the survival and growth of P. lineatus. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={River stage response to alteration of Upper Mississippi River channels, floodplains, and watersheds},
abstract={Issue Title: Upper Mississippi River Research Synthesis: Forty Years of Ecological Research / Guest Editors: S.P. Romano & B. Ickes The Upper Mississippi River System (UMRS) is a large and diverse river system that changes character along its 1,200 mile network of rivers and canals and 2.6 million acres of floodplain. It supports more than 30 million people in its watershed, a significant commercial waterway, more than a million acres of "floodplain" agriculture and about one-half million acres of river-floodplain managed for fish, wildlife, and recreation. Large-scale geomorphology and climate patterns largely determine the hydrologic characteristics of a nested hierarchy of UMRS river reaches. The human impacts above are also important drivers determining hydrologic characteristics within the hierarchy. Understanding the relationship among physical and chemical processes and ecological responses is critical to implement an adaptive management framework for UMRS ecosystem sustainability. Historic or contemporary data from 42 locations were used to examine changes in UMRS hydrology and to demonstrate the utility of a multiple reference condition analysis for river restoration. A multivariate mathematical framework was used to show how river stage hydrology can be characterized by the variability, predictability, seasonality, and rate of change. Large-scale "geomorphic reaches" have distinct hydrologic characteristics and response to development throughout the UMRS region, but within navigation pool hydrology is similar among all impounded reaches regardless of geomorphic reach. Reaches with hydrologic characteristics similar to historic reference conditions should be examined to determine whether those characteristics support desired management objectives. Water levels can be managed, within limits to support navigation and agriculture, to more closely resemble natural hydrology for the benefit of a variety of species, habitats, and ecological processes.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Nitrogen and phosphorus in the Upper Mississippi River: transport, processing, and effects on the river ecosystem},
abstract={Issue Title: Upper Mississippi River Research Synthesis: Forty Years of Ecological Research / Guest Editors: S.P. Romano & B. Ickes Existing research on nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) in the Upper Mississippi River (UMR) can be organized into the following categories: (1) Long-term changes in nutrient concentrations and export, and their causes; (2) Nutrient cycling within the river; (3) Spatial and temporal patterns of river nutrient concentrations; (4) Effects of elevated nutrient concentrations on the river; and (5) Actions to reduce river nutrient concentrations and flux. Nutrient concentration and flux in the Mississippi River have increased substantially over the last century because of changes in land use, climate, hydrology, and river management and engineering. As in other large floodplain rivers, rates of processes that cycle nitrogen and phosphorus in the UMR exhibit pronounced spatial and temporal heterogeneity because of the complex morphology of the river. This spatial variability in nutrient processing creates clear spatial patterns in nutrient concentrations. For example, nitrate concentrations generally are much lower in off-channel areas than in the main channel. The specifics of in-river nutrient cycling and the effects of high rates of nutrient input on UMR have been less studied than the factors affecting nutrient input to the river and transport to the Gulf of Mexico, and important questions concerning nutrient cycling in the UMR remain. Eutrophication and resulting changes in river productivity have only recently been investigated the UMR. These recent studies indicate that the high nutrient concentrations in the river may affect community composition of aquatic vegetation (e.g., the abundance of filamentous algae and duckweeds), dissolved oxygen concentrations in off-channel areas, and the abundance of cyanobacteria. Actions to reduce nutrient input to the river include changes in land-use practices, wetland restoration, and hydrological modifications to the river. Evidence suggests that most of the above methods can contribute to reducing nutrient concentration in, and transport by, the UMR, but the impacts of mitigation efforts will likely be only slowly realized.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={An appraisal of a biocontamination assessment method for freshwater macroinvertebrate assemblages; a practical way to measure a significant biological pressure?},
abstract={Freshwater invasive or alien species (IAS) can have a major impact on benthic macroinvertebrate assemblage structure and diversity. This has implications for accurate biological monitoring, the assessment of the ecological quality status of rivers and achievement of Water Framework Directive (WFD) objectives. Although IAS constitutes a major biological pressure to WFD objectives, current approaches to ecological status assessment tend to ignore their presence. This problem is compounded as biotic indices such as the Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP) score do not distinguish between native and IAS, when IAS tend to be more tolerant of organic pollution than the natives they replace. Biocontamination is the presence of an IAS in a system, and we tested a new method of biocontamination assessment, designed to be used alongside current routine water quality monitoring techniques, by applying it to biological monitoring data from the river monitoring programme of a small Island, The Isle of Man. Although 54% of monitoring sites exhibited no biocontamination, 19% showed low or moderate biocontamination and 27% high or severe biocontamination. Richness contamination was low (only two contaminated families being recorded), but abundance contamination was high in some sites (87% of individuals being IAS). Sites with a greater relative abundance of IAS individuals exhibited lower BMWP water quality. Within invaded sites BMWP monitoring was not responsive to changing chemical water quality, whereas within uninvaded sites it was. In invaded sites, the relative abundance of IAS increased as ammonia and BOD^sub 5^ increased. Our study shows current monitoring approaches mask the presence of AIS within assemblages, with some highly biocontaminated sites registering high BMWP biological quality. This new index represents a simple way to integrate the IAS biological pressure into established WFD monitoring programmes, to produce more comprehensive estimates of ecological quality status than are currently being realised.

title={Riverine habitat heterogeneity: the role of slackwaters in providing hydrologic buffers for benthic microfauna},
abstract={Slackwater habitats within lowland rivers support abundant biotic communities and provide these communities with a refuge from increases in discharge. These refuges allow biota to persist as discharges, vary and provide a source of colonists for slackwaters further downstream. In order to investigate the response of slackwater benthic microfaunal communities to changes in discharge, artificial slackwaters were created within the main channel of a lowland river and benthic microfaunal communities were sampled over a 60-day period. Benthic microfauna within the artificial and reference slackwaters were recorded in higher richness and abundance than in the main river channel. Within days the communities in the artificial slackwaters were similar to those in the reference slackwaters. The rapid speed of colonisation suggests that initial colonisation of slackwaters is likely to occur via active or passive dispersal of biota and that these systems and communities are resilient to changes in discharge.

title={The Effect of Municipal Wastewater Effluent on Nitrogen Levels in Onondaga Lake, a 36-Year Record},
abstract={This work presents a retrospective analysis of long-term trends in loading of forms of nitrogen (N) from the Metropolitan Syracuse Wastewater Treatment Plant (Metro), N concentrations in the receiving urban lake (Onondaga Lake, New York), and related water quality status for the period from 1972 to 2007. The history of the evolution of treatment and discharge at Metro, as it affected N loading, is reviewed and forms the basis for identification of five regimes during which unifying conditions of loading and in-lake conditions prevailed. Changes in industrial waste inputs have complicated the effects of upgrades in treatment at Metro from primary (until 1978) to advanced (starting in 2004). Current N loading from Metro is approximately 35% lower than the peak levels observed in the late 1980s to late 1990s, but the areal rate to the lake remains extremely high (approximately 97 g/m^sup 2^*y), representing approximately 75% of the overall N load. Implementation of year-round nitrification treatment has resulted in transformation of the composition of the N load from Metro from ammonia (T-NH^sub 3^) to nitrate (NO^sub 3^^sup -^) dominance. High N concentrations have prevailed in the upper waters of the lake throughout the study period with averages of total N ranging from 2.6 to 4.3 mg/L for the five regimes. Total N levels and partitioning among the forms in the lake generally have tracked Metro loading conditions for the five regimes. The effects of Metro loading on seasonal in-lake patterns are demonstrated to be modified by both hydrologic inputs from tributaries and in-lake operation of biochemical processes. Resolution of these effects is supported by application of both empirical and dynamic mass balance models. Water quality problems related to high concentrations of forms of N are documented, including (1) augmentation of dissolved oxygen depletion during fall mixing from in-lake nitrification events, enabled by high T-NH^sub 3^ levels; (2) violations of ammonia toxicity limits; and (3) violations of nitrite toxicity standards. These problems were either greatly ameliorated or eliminated by Metro's most recent treatment upgrades. Prevailing conditions are considered in a management context, including (1) likelihood of exceedances of toxicity limits in the future and (2) potential role of elevated nitrate levels in preventing mobilization of methyl mercury from the lake's sediments.

abstract={Aegagropila linnaei, a freshwater green macroalga, had been abundant in several locations in The Netherlands before the 1960s. Both the 'lake ball' form of this alga and dense unattached mats floating over the sediment have been described from these locations. After 1967, this species has not been recorded anymore from The Netherlands. In 2007, several historical collection sites were surveyed for extant populations of A. linnaei. All habitats have changed drastically during the last 50<c2><a0>years and were affected severely by eutrophication. Populations of A. linnaei seem to have become extinct in all but one location (Boven Wijde, province Overijssel), where we found very small amounts of attached filaments. The attached form had not been reported previously from The Netherlands. Environmental conditions do not seem suitable anymore to maintain extensive unattached growth forms including the enigmatic lake balls, and the species must be regarded as threatened in The Netherlands and we propose to include A. linnaei in a national red list. The decline of populations elsewhere is reviewed and discussed in this paper. In addition to morphological identification of the attached filaments, partial sequences of the nuclear large subunit rDNA were generated and compared with different growth forms and habitats from several other locations outside The Netherlands. The sequences confirm the identity of the Dutch material and indicate very little divergence both between populations in different locations and between different growth forms.

abstract={Phytoplankton abundance and composition and the cyanotoxin, microcystin, were examined relative to environmental parameters in western Lake Erie during late-summer (2003-2005). Spatially explicit distributions of phytoplankton occurred on an annual basis, with the greatest chlorophyll (Chl) a concentrations occurring in waters impacted by Maumee River inflows and in Sandusky Bay. Chlorophytes, bacillariophytes, and cyanobacteria contributed the majority of phylogenetic-group Chl a basin-wide in 2003, 2004, and 2005, respectively. Water clarity, pH, and specific conductance delineated patterns of group Chl a, signifying that water mass movements and mixing were primary determinants of phytoplankton accumulations and distributions. Water temperature, irradiance, and phosphorus availability delineated patterns of cyanobacterial biovolumes, suggesting that biotic processes (most likely, resource-based competition) controlled cyanobacterial abundance and composition. Intracellular microcystin concentrations corresponded to Microcystis abundance and environmental parameters indicative of conditions coincident with biomass accumulations. It appears that environmental parameters regulate microcystin indirectly, via control of cyanobacterial abundance and distribution. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Biodiversity monitoring: some proposals to adequately study species' responses to climate change},
abstract={Climate change affects all levels of biology and is a major threat for biodiversity. Hence, it is fundamental to run biodiversity monitoring programs to understand the effects of climate change on the biota and to be able to adjust management and conservation accordingly. So far, however, very few existing monitoring programs allow for the detection of climate change effects, as shown by a survey undertaken by the European project EuMon. Despite this shortcoming, several methods exist which allow to make inferences from existing data by integrating data across different monitoring programs: correlative analyses, meta-analyses and models. In addition, experiments are thought to be useful tools to understand the effects of climate change on plants and animals. Here, we evaluate the utility of these four main approaches. All these methods allow to evaluate long term effects of climate change and make predictions of species' future development, but they are arguable. We list and compare their benefits and inconveniences, which can lead to uncertainties in the extrapolation of species responses to global climate change. Individual characteristics and population parameters have to be more frequently monitored. The potential evolution of a species should be also modelled, to extrapolate results across spatial and temporal scales as well as to analyse the combined effects of different climatic and biotic factors, including intra but also interspecific relationships. We conclude that a combination of methodologies would be the most promising tool for the assessment of biological responses to climate change, and we provide some thoughts about how to do so. Particularly, we encourage long-term studies along natural gradients (altitudinal or latitudinal) on the same species/habitats to be able to extrapolate to large geographic scales, and to have more complete data sets, necessary to understand the mechanisms of responses. Such data may provide a more accurate base for simulations across spatial and temporal scales, especially if they are publicly available in a common database. These recommendations could allow the adaptation of species management and the development of conservation tools to climate change which threatens species. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Main conditions were optimized, including pH value, salinity of water sample, elution reagents, clean procedure, derivative solvent and temperature. The optimized method was used to determine steroid estrogens in surface water and effluents of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Low detection limits of 0.01, 0.03, 0.03, 0.07, 0.09 and 0.13<c2><a0>ng/l for DES, E1, E2, EE2, E3 and EV, respectively were obtained under optimism condition.

The results suggested that the optimized method provides a robust solution for the determination of trace steroid estrogens in complex matrix. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Replacement of a native freshwater macroinvertebrate species by an invader: implications for biological water quality monitoring},
abstract={The rate of freshwater invasions may be increasing, and macroinvertebrate invaders can have significant impacts on native macroinvertebrate assemblage structure through biotic interactions. More pollution-tolerant invaders can often replace native species. We examined implications of a species replacement for accurate biological monitoring of river systems using biotic indices. Our study uses Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man as examples of countries that possess river networks with many riverine macroinvertebrate assemblages subject to invasion. The introduced amphipod crustacean Gammarus pulex has replaced the native species G. duebeni celticus in many rivers in N. Ireland and the Isle of Man. Extensive seasonal data sets (119 sites) from three river networks, Lough Neagh and the Lagan in N. Ireland, and island-wide in the Isle of Man, were used to investigate the assumed equivalence of the native and invader in biotic indices concerned with the water quality monitoring system. Based on the derivation of the Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP) score, the Average Score Per Taxon (ASPT), as an example of a commonly used biotic index of water quality, we found index scores were lower in G. pulex sites compared to G. d. celticus-only sites. This indicated that assemblages were dominated by taxa more tolerant of organic pollution in the invader sites and more sensitive in the native sites. Inclusion of the invader in generation of the ASPT index, overinflated the ASPT values obtained compared to those with the native's inclusion. This questions the accuracy of the ASPT and similar indices in rivers where the invader had replaced the native. We argue that with invasion pressures increasing, the validity of water quality indices such as the BMWP/ASPT needs to be re-examined in catchments where invaders have replaced natives. Indices such as the BMWP/ASPT are based on family level taxa and are inevitably coarse in their resolution given the wide range of water qualities tolerated by different genera within families. We argue that this resolution is even more compromised by the presence of very pollution-tolerant invaders, who may have replaced natives in disturbed or degraded river systems. The whole structure of water quality indices such as the BMWP/ASPT may need revising to take into account the presence of invasive species within monitored assemblages. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Effects of food quality on tissue-specific isotope ratios in the mussel Perna perna},
abstract={Investigations into trophic ecology and aquatic food web resolution are increasingly accomplished through stable isotope analysis. The incorporation of dietary and metabolic changes over time results in variations in isotope signatures and turnover rates of producers and consumers at tissue, individual, population and species levels. Consequently, the elucidation of trophic relationships in aquatic systems depends on establishing standard isotope values and tissue turnover rates for the level in question. This study investigated the effect of diet and food quality on isotopic signatures of four mussel tissues: adductor muscle, gonad, gill and mantle tissue from the brown mussel Perna perna. In the laboratory, mussels were fed one of the two isotopically distinct diets for 3<c2><a0>months. Although not all results were significant, overall <ce><b4>13C ratios in adductor, mantle and gill tissues gradually approached food source signatures in both diets. PERMANOVA analyses revealed significant changes over time in tissue <ce><b4>13C (mantle and gill) with both diets and in <ce><b4>15N (all tissues) and C:N ratios (mantle and gill) for one diet only. The percentage of replaced carbon isotopes were calculated for the 3<c2><a0>month period and differed among tissues and between diets. The tissue with the highest and lowest amount of replaced isotopes over 81<c2><a0>days were mantle tissue on the kelp diet (33.89%) and adductor tissue on the fish food diet (4.14%), respectively. Percentages could not be calculated for any tissue in either diet for <ce><b4>15N due to the lack of significant change in tissue nitrogen. Fractionation patterns in tissues for both diets can be linked to nutritional stress, suggesting that consumer isotopic signatures are strongly dependent on food quality, which can significantly affect the degree of isotopic enrichment within a trophic level.

title={Effects of mooring management on submerged vegetation, sediments and macro-invertebrates in Lake Constance, Germany},
abstract={Mooring areas are a common form of berthing in many of Germany's inland waters for the growing number of sporting boats. A circular swinging zone around the anchor zone is formed, in which the submerged macrophyte vegetation is destroyed to a large extent, and the sediment surface is eroded. We investigated the effects of two types of buoy (conventional and so-called hook-buoys) in comparison with undisturbed reference sites nearby. The aim of the study was to identify possible harmful consequences of mooring sites to lake littoral habitats in Lake Constance-Untersee, and to provide information to managers to aid them in the formulation of mooring management plans with the least ecological impact. The study focused on submerged vegetation, surface sediments and macro-invertebrate colonisation. In the swinging circle of conventional buoys (87<c2><a0>m2) we observed a significant sediment matter erosion of 0.9<c2><a0>tonnes and a reduction of organic matter amount by 4.5% of the undisturbed reference. The vegetation free area increased by 122%, and the phytomass (mainly Chara<c2><a0>div.<c2><a0>spp.) was reduced by 14.6% per berth. The psammophilous macro-invertebrate numbers were not significantly affected (-3%) in contrast to the phytophilous taxa which were reduced by 12.7% per berth. The mayfly larvae were the most negatively affected taxon. Oligochaetes profited from the clearing of the sediment surface in the swinging circles. The ecological effects of the hook-buoys were more minor, mainly due to the smaller swinging circle (6<c2><a0>m2). We concluded that the detrimental effects of mooring can be significantly reduced by mooring systems, e. g. the hook-buoy system as it was used in this study, which reduce the area disturbed and cleared by the anchor chain. We argue that these results can be generalised to mooring areas with soft bottom and dense macrophyte vegetation in Lake Constance and other large lakes. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

This formation is exposed in several, roughly coeval (9.4-8.9<c2><a0>Ma) outcrops, located along strike of the paleo-shelf-break in northwestern Hungary. The silty argillaceous marl of the formation was deposited below storm wave base, at 20-30 to 80-90<c2><a0>m water depth. The abundance of benthic organisms indicates that the bottom water was usually well oxygenated. Interstitial dysoxia, however, may have occurred immediately below the sediment-water interface, as evidenced by occasional preservation of trace fossils such as Diplocraterion. The fauna comprised endemic mollusks, including brackish cockles of the subfamily Lymnocardiinae, dreissenid mussels (Congeria), and highly adapted, uniquely large-sized deep-water pulmonate snails (planorbids and lymnaeids). Ostracods were dominated by endemic species and, in some cases, endemic genera of candonids, leptocytherids, cypridids, and loxoconchids. Fish remnants include a sciaenid otolith and the oldest skeletal occurrence of Perca in Europe. The phytoplankton comprised exclusively endemic coccolithophorids, mostly endemic dinoflagellates (prevailingly Spiniferites), and cosmopolitan green algae. The Late Miocene fauna and flora of Lake Pannon were in many ways similar to the modern Caspian biota, and in particular cases can be regarded as its precursor. (PUBLICATION ABSTRACT)},

Round Gobies have increased exponentially in the Great Lakes and now constitute >90% of prey consumed by Lake Erie Watersnakes. We investigated the effects this shift may have on round goby populations by estimating total prey consumption by Lake Erie Watersnakes. Digestive rate trials and maximum voluntary prey consumption trials indicate that gastric digestion is rapid (digestion was 90% complete after just 16.4 hours at 30<c2><b0>C and 20.1 hours at 25<c2><b0>C) and voluntary prey consumption is high (from 30.0% of adult female body mass to 117% of neonate body mass in five days). Based on palpation of wild-caught snakes, prey were detected more frequently in adult females than adult males, but no such difference was observed in subadults. The proportion of snakes containing prey varied over time with season-long averages of 11.6% for adult females, 6.9% for adult males, and 22.4% for subadults. Systematic surveys by boat indicate that nearly 90% of foraging occurs <150 m from shore. Projected annual consumption, based on gastric digestion rate, maximum voluntary prey consumption, feeding frequency of free-ranging snakes, and published energetic data and a population size of 12,000 adult watersnakes, ranges from 200,000-3,300,000 Round Gobies (4,455-56,178 kg) per year. Although impressive, this rate of prey consumption is unlikely to have more than local effects on Round Goby populations. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Comparison between the mercury contamination in populations of Unio pictorum mancus (Mollusca, Bivalvia) from two lakes of different trophic state: the oligo-mesotrophic Lake Maggiore and the eutrophic Lake Candia},
abstract={This research was designed to evaluate the influence of mussel (Unio pictorum mancus) size on mercury concentration in mussel soft tissues. It also evaluated the relationships between calcium, mercury and selenium in the mussel tissues. The mussel populations from the deep, meso-oligotrophic Lake Maggiore and the shallow, eutrophic Lake Candia were analyzed. The mean concentration of mercury in the tissues was 0.075 mg kg-1 in Lake Maggiore mussels and 0.033 mg kg-1 in Lake Candia mussels. The local mercury content in the mussel biomass per surface unit was about eleven-fold higher in Lake Maggiore (5.99 <ce><bc>g Hg m-2) than in Lake Candia (0.55 <ce><bc>g Hg m-2). This wide difference was due firstly to the larger population density (46.86 vs 6.93 ind m-2) and secondly to the higher individual content (0.128 vs 0.079 <ce><bc>g Hg ind-1) in Lake Maggiore than in Lake Candia. These differences in population density and individual mercury content are the result of both biological and environmental characteristics. Lake trophy and water renewal affect population density and individual growth rate, and ultimately determine their impact on biogeochemical cycles by regulating the mussel standing stock. The relationships between mercury, calcium and selenium were taken into account.},

abstract={Great scallop, Pecten maximus, and blue mussel, Mytilus edulis, clearance rate (CR) responses to low natural seston concentrations were investigated in the laboratory to study (1) short-term CR variations in individual bivalves exposed to a single low seston diet, and (2) seasonal variations in average CR responses of bivalve cohorts to natural environmental variations. On a short temporal scale, mean CR response of both species to 0.06 <c2><b5>g L^sup -1^ chlorophyll a (Chl a) and 0.23 mg L^sup -1^ suspended particulate matter (SPM) remained constant despite large intra-individual fluctuations in CR. In the seasonal study, cohorts of each species were exposed to four seston treatments consisting of ambient and diluted natural seston that ranged in mean concentration from 0.15 to 0.43 mg L^sup -1^ SPM, 0.01 to 0.88 <c2><b5>g L^sup -1^ Chl a, 36 to 131 <c2><b5>g L^sup -1^ particulate organic carbon and 0.019 to 0.330 mm^sup 3^ L^sup -1^ particle volume. Although food abundance in all treatments was low, the nutritional quality of the seston was relatively high (e.g., mean particulate organic content ranged from 68 to 75%). Under these low seston conditions, a high percentage of P. maximus (81-98%) and M. edulis (67-97%) actively cleared particles at mean rates between 9 and 12 and between 4 and 6 L g^sup -1^ h^sup -1^, respectively. For both species, minimum mean CR values were obtained for animals exposed to the lowest seston concentrations. Within treatments, P. maximus showed a greater degree of seasonality in CR than M. edulis, which fed at a relatively constant rate despite seasonal changes in food and temperature. P. maximus showed a non-linear CR response to increasing Chl a levels, with rates increasing to a maximum at approximately 0.4 <c2><b5>g L^sup -1^ Chl a and then decreasing as food quantity continued to increase. Mean CR of M. edulis also peaked at a similar concentration, but remained high and stable as the food supply continued to increase and as temperatures varied between 4.6 and 19.6<c2><b0>C. The results show that P. maximus and M. edulis from a low seston environment, do not stop suspension-feeding at very low seston quantities; a result that contradicts previous conclusions on the suspension-feeding behavior of bivalve mollusks and which is pertinent to interpreting the biogeographic distribution of bivalve mollusks and site suitability for aquaculture.

abstract={Carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes are frequently used to study energy sources and food web structure in ecosystems, and more recently, to study the effects of anthropogenic stress on aquatic ecosystems. We investigated the effect of nutrient enrichment on <ce><b4>13C and <ce><b4>15N in fine (FPOM), coarse (CPOM) particulate organic matter, periphyton, invertebrates and fish in nine boreal streams in south-central Sweden. In addition, we analysed the diet of benthic consumers using stable isotope data. Increases in <ce><b4>15N of periphyton (R 2<c2><a0>=<c2><a0>0.88), CPOM (0.78), invertebrates (0.92) and fish (0.89) were related to nutrient enrichment. In contrast, <ce><b4>13C signatures did not change along the nutrient gradient. Our results show that <ce><b4>15N has potential as a sensitive indicator of nutrient enrichment in boreal streams. Carbon and nitrogen isotopes failed to elucidate putative diets of selected aquatic consumers. Indeed, comparison of low- and high-impact sites showed that <ce><b4>13C of many consumers were found outside the ranges of basal resource <ce><b4>13C. Moreover, ranges of basal resource <ce><b4>13C and <ce><b4>15N overlapped at both low and high sites, making discrimination between the importance of allochthonous and autochthonous production difficult. Our findings show that a fractionation rate of 3.4[per thousand] is not always be appropriate to assess trophic interactions, suggesting that more studies are needed on fractionation rates along gradients of impairment.

abstract={The biotic influences of the biodeposition and bioturbation activities of the freshwater mussel Lamellidens marginalis (Lamarck) on the ecological interactions between certain co-existing benthic invertebrates leading to variations in their population densities were studied through a lake mesocosm experiment. The benthic organisms whose densities were monitored include nematodes, oligochaetes, chironomids, small snails and sediment dwelling colony-forming bacteria. Five exclusion (without mussels) and five experimental (with mussels) mesocosms were maintained up to 60 days (d). Even though there were no significant variations in the population densities of the organisms in the exclusion mesocosms, those of the experimental mesocosms showed significant variations. However, the patterns of variations of the population densities were different for the various organisms studied. The study clearly indicated the influences exerted by L. marginalis on the population richness of the co-existing benthic organisms. The study also revealed the probable trophic interactions between the various organisms studied. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Locomotion versus spawning: escape responses during and after spawning in the scallop Argopecten purpuratus},
abstract={The energetic cost of spawning and the endogenous factors that modulate spawning could modify escape response performance, leading to a conflict between the requirements of two fundamental components of fitness: reproduction and survival. We examined whether spawning changed force production during escape responses by the functionally hermaphroditic scallop, Argopecten purpuratus, and whether the response of smooth (tonic) and striated (phasic) muscles differed. Force production during escape responses by mature scallops was compared before induction of spawning, during spawning and after completion of spawning. Maximum tonic force and the area under the force curve (total force recorded) were diminished during gamete release, whereas phasic force production (maximum and mean force) increased after spawning was completed. The number and frequency of phasic contractions did not change during the spawning process, suggesting that spawning did not limit fuel availability for phasic contractions. The decrease in tonic force during spawning and the increased phasic force production after spawning may reflect changes in monoamine levels during gamete release. Whereas the spawning process modified force production during escape responses, the changes would, if anything, enhance escape performance during an initial encounter between a scallop and a predatory sea star.

abstract={We examined the temporal and vertical dynamics of zooplankton in Weavers Lake, New Zealand, between October 2004 and October 2005, at a time when it was colonised by a non-indigenous Daphnia species. Zooplankton community composition changed during the study from one of rotifer dominance (e.g. Asplanchna, Polyarthra, Brachionus and Keratella species) to cladoceran (Daphnia dentifera) dominance. Temporal changes in zooplankton community composition were strongly associated with a gradual increase in lake water clarity, and were attributable to the highly efficient filter feeding of D. dentifera. The corresponding reduction in rotifer densities may have resulted from the superior competitive abilities of the newly established Daphnia. As Daphnia were rare inhabitants of New Zealand lakes before 1990, the arrival and rapid spread of the non-indigenous D. dentifera has lead to widespread changes in both water clarity and zooplankton community composition. An apparent lack of mixing in the lake was facilitated by the lake's extremely small surface area:depth ratio. However, we conclude that physical features of the lake had minimal influence on water clarity relative to the invasion of D. dentifera. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Arginine metabolism of the Antarctic Bivalve Laternula elliptica (King & Broderip, 1831): an ecophysiological approach},
abstract={The potential aerobic ATP-generating pathway and the argininolytic capacity of the Antarctic bivalve Laternula elliptica in its main tissues were measured by the specific activity of the enzymes malate dehydrogenase (MDH), citrate synthase (CS) and arginase. The kidney showed the major potential for aerobic ATP-generating pathway and argininolytic capacity. High levels of CS and MDH activities indicated that renal tissue can be involved in activities that require a lot of energy such as excretion of metabolic end products, amino acids catabolism or even gluconeogenic activities related to inter-tissue metabolism. The fact that kidneys are the main site for arginase activity is very unusual for mollusks and could be related to the living habits of L. elliptica. Genetic expression of the L. elliptica renal arginase could be controlling the levels of l-arginine and forming urea in the excretory organ, which may not have its physiological functions directly affected by the seasonal retraction of its siphons. Compared to the bivalve Dreissena polymorpha, renal arginase of L. elliptica is more resistant to inhibition by copper and cadmium. This could be related to naturally high levels of these metals in the Antarctic marine environment and its bioaccumulation in the renal tissue of L. elliptica, as a probable advantage to its environmental adaptation. Different from other Antarctic animals that feed on Krill, the arginase of L. elliptica is much more sensitive to fluoride inhibition. However, diet composition of L. elliptica would be expected to be variable site to site and its high sensitivity to fluoride inhibition may be a matter of concern in areas near ornithogenic soils subjected to ice-melting processes.

These differences in feeding structures might allow these species to utilize different food resources, or could be related to other functions performed by the gills, including respiration or brood storage.},

abstract={We describe culturing techniques and development for the cold-seep mussel "Bathymodiolus " childressi, the only deep-sea bivalve for which development has been detailed. Spawning was induced in mature mussels by injection of 2 mmol 1^sup -1^ serotonin into the anterior adductor muscle. The mean egg diameter is 69.15 <c2><b1> 2.36 <c2><b5>m (<c2><b1>S.D.; n = 50) and eggs are negatively buoyant. Cleavages are spiral and at 7-8 <c2><b0>C occur at a rate of one per 3-9 h through hatching, with free-swimming blastulae hatching by 40 h and shells beginning to develop by day 12. When temperature was raised to 12-14 <c2><b0>C after hatching, larvae developed to D-shell veligers by day 8 without being fed. Egg size and larval shell morphology indicate that "B." childressi has a planktotrophic larva, but we did not observe feeding in culture. Wide distribution of this species throughout the Gulf of Mexico and amphi-Atlantic distributions of closely related congeners suggest that larvae may spend extended periods in the plankton. Duration of larval life was estimated for "B." childressi by comparing calculated settlement times to known spawning seasons. These estimates suggest variability in the larval duration, with individuals spending more than a year in the plankton. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Fine-Scale Population Genetic Structure of Zhikong Scallop (Chlamys farreri): Do Local Marine Currents Drive Geographical Differentiation?},
abstract={Marine scallops, with extended planktonic larval stages which can potentially disperse over large distances when advected by marine currents, are expected to possess low geographical differentiation. However, the sessile lifestyle as adult tends to form discrete "sea beds" with unique population dynamics and structure. The narrow distribution of Zhikong scallop (Chlamys farreri), its long planktonic larval stage, and the extremely hydrographic complexity in its distribution range provide an interesting case to elucidate the impact of marine currents on geographical differentiation for marine bivalves at a fine geographical scale. In this study, we analyzed genetic variation at nine microsatellite DNA loci in six locations throughout the distribution of Zhikong scallop in the Northern China. Very high genetic diversity was present in all six populations. Two populations sampled from the same marine gyre had no detectable genetic differentiation (F ST=0.0013); however, the remaining four populations collected from different marine gyres or separated by strong marine currents showed low but significant genetic differentiation (FST range 0.0184-0.0602). Genetic differentiation was further analyzed using the Monmonier algorithm to identify genetic barriers and using the assignment test conducted by software GeneClass2 to ascertain population membership of individuals. The genetic barriers fitting the orientation of marine gyres/currents were clearly identified, and the individual assignment analysis indicated that 95.6% of specimens were correctly allocated to one of the six populations sampled. The results support the hypothesis that significant population structure is present in Zhikong scallop at a fine geographical scale, and marine currents can be responsible for the genetic differentiation.

title={Do elephants prevent other African herbivores from using waterholes in the dry season?},
abstract={In some African protected areas, concerns have arisen about the influence of locally high elephant numbers on other forms of biodiversity. In arid and semi-arid savannas, surface-water resources are scarce and agonistic interactions between elephants and other herbivores have been reported at waterholes, yet surprisingly very little is known about the impact of elephants on the use of waterholes by other herbivores. Here, we test whether when there are elephants at a waterhole, other herbivores (1) do not change their drinking behaviour; (2) spend shorter time around the water because they are disturbed by elephants' presence and consequently have to leave the waterhole area probably without having met their water requirements, or (3) spend more time around the water probably owing to an increase in vigilance activities or because the presence of elephants may signal safety from predators. Results show that all species spend longer time around water when there are elephants at the waterhole, although the difference is not large. Consequently, this study strongly suggests that elephants do not prevent other herbivores from drinking (time at waterholes is not shortened when elephants are around). Further, if the additional time spent to drink is linked to an increased vigilance, the difference is not large, and hence unlikely to affect the population dynamics of other herbivores.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Status and Trends Program (NS&T) participated in this effort by measuring chemical contamination in sediment and oyster tissue as part of the Mussel Watch Program, a long-term monitoring program to assess spatial and temporal trends in a wide range of coastal pollutants. This paper describes results for contaminants measured in oyster tissue collected between September 29 and October 10, 2005 and discusses the results in the context of Mussel Watch and its 20-year record of chemical contamination in the region and the nation. In general, levels of metals in oyster tissue were higher then pre- hurricane levels while organic contaminants were at or near record lows. No contaminant reported here exceeded the FDA action level for food safety. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

The results also indicate significant differences (modified version of the Lewontin-Krakauer test) between the two sets of markers which are about one order of magnitude higher for nDNA than for the allozyme loci. The bootstrap analysis was carried out to correct for the possibility that this difference is a sample size artefact. These results are consistent with the operation of balancing selection on allozymes or on loci in linkage disequilibrium with them. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={In recent years, new classes of aquatic pollutants have received attention from environmentalists, scientists, and regulators due to their introduction into the environment, unforeseen effects associated with the pollutants, or enhanced analytical techniques presently capable of detecting them. Many of these emerging contaminants are not well studied, making predictions regarding their toxicity to aquatic organisms or environmental fate difficult. Genomic technologies, including DNA microarrays, have been employed in many areas of biology to study disease states and the interaction of chemicals and nutrients with organisms. Here, we present the potential utility of DNA microarrays to address the challenges of emerging contaminants. DNA microarrays produce gene expression profiles creating an illustration of how a pollutant is acting within an exposed organism. Homology searches and online tools such as Gene Ontology can aid in the inferring a Mode of Toxicity, which may guide toxicity testing and risk characterization. Signature gene expression profiles offer the potential to uncover novel biomarkers of exposure and predict the presence of these contaminants in aquatic organisms. The No Observed Transcriptional Effect Level may play a role in determining if a predicted environmental concentration poses a risk to a sensitive species within an ecosystem. Additionally, DNA microarrays may add a complementary approach to Toxicity Identification Evaluations and help characterize causal agents in complex effluents. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Interactions among invaders: community and ecosystem effects of multiple invasive species in an experimental aquatic system},
abstract={With ecosystems increasingly supporting multiple invasive species, interactions among invaders could magnify or ameliorate the undesired consequences for native communities and ecosystems. We evaluated the individual and combined effects of rusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus) and Chinese mystery snails [Bellamya (=Cipangopaludina) chinensis] on native snail communities (Physa, Helisoma and Lymnaea sp.) and ecosystem attributes (algal chlorophyll<c2><a0>a and nutrient concentrations). Both invaders are widespread in the USA and commonly co-occur within northern temperate lakes, underscoring the importance of understanding their singular and joint effects. An outdoor mesocosm experiment revealed that while the two invaders had only weakly negative effects upon one another, both negatively affected the abundance and biomass of native snails, and their combined presence drove one native species to extinction and reduced a second by >95%. Owing to its larger size and thicker shell, adult Bellamya were protected from crayfish attack relative to native species (especially Physa and Lymnaea), suggesting the co-occurrence of these invaders in nature could have elevated consequences for native communities. The per capita impacts of Orconectes (a snail predator) on native snails were substantially greater than those of Bellamya (a snail competitor). Crayfish predation also had a cascading effect by reducing native snail biomass, leading to increased periphyton growth. Bellamya, in contrast, reduced periphyton biomass, likely causing a reduction in growth by native lymnaeid snails. Bellamya also increased water column N:P ratio, possibly because of a low P excretion rate relative to native snail species. Together, these findings highlight the importance of understanding interactions among invasive species, which can have significant community- and ecosystem-level effects.},

A total of 401 dives (comprising 1,015 transects and 14,373 habitat patches) were made in waters between 19 and 365<c2><a0>m deep. All natural habitat types were included, although both soft sea floors and rocky reefs were surveyed more than any other type. A total of 717,526 fishes, representing a minimum of 137 species and 47 families, were observed. Rockfishes (genus Sebastes), with a minimum of 50 species and 647,495 individuals (90.2% of all fishes observed), dominated most of the habitats. The most abundant species, squarespot (Sebastes hopkinsi), halfbanded (Sebastes semicinctus), shortbelly (Sebastes jordani), and pygmy rockfishes (Sebastes wilsoni), are dwarf taxa that either school or aggregate. The most abundant non-rockfish species was the benthic and territorial blackeye goby (Rhinogobiops nicholsii). Both species richness and overall fish densities were highest in the shallowest sites. Most of the fishes in all habitats were small (<e2><89><a4>20<c2><a0>cm TL long) and economically important species were generally uncommon. Forty-four species were found to be characteristic of the study area (occurring in at least 5% of the transects) and these species formed three faunal associations centered around depths of 62, 105, and 168<c2><a0>m. Based on size frequency distributions, at least 18 of the characteristic species exhibited ontogenetic movements, with young-of-the-year and older juveniles living in relatively shallow waters and larger individuals generally in deeper depths. In this study, the abundance of juvenile widow rockfish (Sebastes entomelas), and the virtual absence of adults, in southern California waters may demonstrate an ontogenetic northward movement of this species. This research implies that substantial harvesting of larger species by commercial and recreational fishers has helped alter some fish assemblages, allowing small and "weedy" species to thrive.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={The estuarine area of the Massangana River (Pernambuco, Brazil) undergoes several kinds of interventions as a result of the activities of the Suape Industrial and Harbor Complex, which could affect local biotic communities. Thus, this study aimed to verify the composition of the benthic macrofauna of hard substrates regarding their vertical distribution in order to support the future biomonitoring of possible changes in this complex. The invertebrates found in an area of 519 m2 were collected and their distribution on the biogenic and abiogenic substrates was described. A total of 79 species were found, primarily in the mangroves and distributed in three intertidal zones: a Chthamaletum, which comprised the intertidal and upper shore, the balanid zone, with barnacles and oysters in the mid intertidal, and the Bostrychietum, in the lowest region. In general, this matched the Brazilian and international vertical distribution patterns for mangrove invertebrates. The presence of rocky substrate and the area's high salinity made possible the occurrence of 28 species--including the coral Siderastrea stellata--in an estuarine area. The enlarged distribution of the bivalve Isognomon alatus, the barnacle Amphibalanus reticulatus, and the bryozoans Biflustra savartii, Bowerbankia gracilis, and Conopeum reticulum on the Brazilian coast can be explained by the proximity to the Port of Suape, which allows for passive transportation on ships. The scattered distribution of the fouling organisms among the substrates and the absence of characteristic animals of this ecosystem (such as the mussels) suggest that the environment is already undergoing some stress due to the diverse human interventions occurring in this area.

title={Corticosterone in relation to tissue cadmium, mercury and selenium concentrations and social status of male lesser scaup (Aythya affinis)},
abstract={Combined lesser scaup (Aythya affinis) and greater scaup (A.<c2><a0>marila) populations have declined steadily from the 1970s. Accompanying the population decline have been two shifts in lesser scaup demographics: a decrease in the proportion of young birds and an increase in male to female ratio. In addition, there are concerns about potential effects of contaminants and trace elements. These metals may influence the stress response and corticosterone secretion. We examined impacts of cadmium, selenium and mercury on the stress response in relation to social status in male lesser scaup near Yellowknife, NWT May to June 2004 and 2005. Kidney cadmium and liver selenium and mercury ranged 0.78-93.6, 2.12-9.64, and 0.56-3.71<c2><a0><ce><bc>g/g, dry<c2><a0>weight, respectively. Results suggest that corticosterone release may be influenced by complex contaminant interactions in relation to body condition and body size. When cadmium was high and birds were in good body condition, there was a negative relationship between liver selenium and corticosterone (R 2<c2><a0>=<c2><a0>0.60, n<c2><a0>=<c2><a0>10, P<c2><a0>=<c2><a0>0.008) but not in birds with poor body condition (R 2<c2><a0>=<c2><a0>0.07, n<c2><a0>=<c2><a0>9, P<c2><a0>=<c2><a0>0.50). Unfortunately we were unable to draw any conclusions about metals and social status in relation to corticosterone or glucose and T4. This study emphasizes the complex nature of biological systems and the importance of considering interactions to characterize effects of metals. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Realism of model ecosystems: an evaluation of physicochemistry and macroinvertebrate assemblages in artificial streams},
abstract={Issue Title: Copepoda in the Mediterranean: Papers from the 9th International Conference on Copepoda, Hammamet, Tunisia / Guest Editors: S. Souissi and G.A. Boxshall Ecological realism is an important yet rarely reported feature of model ecosystems. In this case study, we assess the realism of four outdoor artificial stream mesocosms (4<c2><a0>m2) bordering a chalk river in southern England. Comparisons of physiochemical conditions and benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages were made between the mesocosm units and the parent water body, a side arm of the River Frome. Physicochemistry of the mesocosm replicates was similar to that of the source stream, with congruent temporal variation evident between the real system and each of the models. The high realism of the mesocosms was explained by the outdoor location and close physical proximity of the array to the source stream, and the short mesocosm residence time of water sourced from the parent feeder system. Mesocosms supported a diverse array of benthic macroinvertebrates (60 families from 14 taxonomic orders), including all macroinvertebrate families in the source stream. Individual mesocosms contained a mean of 89% of source stream biota. We conclude that once-through mesocosms can be satisfactory analogues of natural systems, particularly where model and natural scales overlap. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={The bivalve Pisidium amnicum (M<c3><bc>ller 1774) is a common species in several European freshwater ecosystems. However, few Iberian watersheds are colonized by this species, and the River Minho estuary is possibly the Iberian aquatic ecosystem with the larger population. In October 2004-2007, investigations on spatial and temporal variations in P. amnicum abundance and biomass were carried out at 16 sites along the River Minho tidal freshwater wetlands. Mean abundance and biomass per site ranged from 0 to 750<c2><a0>ind m-2 and 0 to 7.42<c2><a0>g AFDW m-2, respectively. A clear decrease in the spatial distribution, abundance, and biomass was observed during the 4-year assessment. Furthermore, a stepwise multiple regression model showed that organic matter and conductivity explained 50.2% of the variation in P. amnicum abundance (R 2=0.502, F [2, 15]=7.569, p=0.005). Ecological knowledge is essential to the implementation of future conservation plans for P. amnicum, and the results of this study are of paramount importance to identify habitats that should be protected in order to preserve this species and provide scientific reference that may be useful in the development of management and/or restoration plans.

title={Ancient Lake Ohrid: biodiversity and evolution},
abstract={Issue Title: Patterns and Processes of Speciation in Ancient Lakes: Proceedings of the Fourth Symposium on Speciation in Ancient Lakes, Berlin, Germany, September 4-8, 2006 / Guest Editors: T. Wilke, R. V<c3><a4>in<c3><b6>l<c3><a4> & F. Riedel Worldwide ancient lakes have been a major focal point of geological, biological, and ecological research, and key concepts in, for example, evolutionary biology are partly based on ancient lake studies. Ancient lakes can be found on most continents and climate zones with most actual or putative ancient lakes in Europe being restricted to the Balkan Region. The arguably most outstanding of them is the oligotrophic and karstic Lake Ohrid, a steep-sided graben of rift formation origin situated in the central Balkans. Here, an attempt is made to summarize current knowledge of the geological, limnological, and faunal history of Lake Ohrid. Additionally, existing data on biodiversity and endemism in Lake Ohrid are updated and evaluated, and patterns and processes of speciation are reviewed in the context of the Ohrid watershed, including its sister lake, Lake Prespa. Whereas the geological history of the Ohrid Graben is relatively well studied, there is little knowledge about the limnological and biotic history of the actual lake (e.g., the age of the extant lake or from where the lake first received its water, along with its first biota). Most workers agree on a time frame of origin for Lake Ohrid of 2-5<c2><a0>million years ago (Mya). However, until now, the exact limnological origin and the origin of faunal or floral elements of Lake Ohrid remain uncertain. Two largely contrasting opinions either favour the theory of de<c2><a0>novo formation of Lake Ohrid in a dry polje with a spring or river hydrography or a palaeogeographical connection of Lake Ohrid to brackish waters on the Balkan Peninsula. Whereas neither theory can be rejected at this point, the data summarized in the current review support the de<c2><a0>novo hypothesis. An assessment of the fauna and flora of Lake Ohrid confirms that the lake harbours an incredible endemic biodiversity. Despite the fact that some biotic groups are poorly studied or not studied at all, approximately 1,200 native species are known from the lake, including 586 animals, and at least 212 species are endemic, including 182 animals. The adjusted rate of endemicity is estimated at 36% for all taxa and 34% for Animalia. In terms of endemic biodiversity, Lake Ohrid is with these 212 known endemic species and a surface area of 358<c2><a0>km2 probably the most diverse lake in the world, taking surface area into account. Preliminary phylogeographical analyses of endemic Lake Ohrid taxa indicate that the vast majority of respective sister taxa occurs in the Balkans and that therefore the most recent common ancestors of Ohrid- and non-Ohrid species likely resided in the region when Lake Ohrid came into existence. These data also indicate that there is relatively little faunal exchange and overlap between Lake Ohrid and its sister lake, Lake Prespa, despite the fact that the latter lake is a major water supplier for Lake Ohrid. Studies on selected species flocks and scatters, mostly in molluscs, point towards the assumption that only few lineages originally colonized Lake Ohrid from the Balkans and that the majority of endemic species seen today probably started to evolve within the lake during the early Pleistocene. Within the Ohrid watershed, endemism occurs at different spatial and taxonomic scales, ranging from species endemic to certain parts of Lake Ohrid to species endemic to the whole watershed and from subspecies to genus level and possibly beyond. Modes of speciation in the Ohrid watershed are largely affected by its degree of isolation. Observational evidence points towards both allopatric (peripatric) and parapatric speciation. Though sympatric speciation within a habitat is conceivable, so far there are no known examples. Today, the lake suffers from increasing anthropogenic pressure and a "creeping biodiversity crisis". Some endemic species presumably have already gone extinct, and there are also indications of invasive species penetrating Lake Ohrid. The comparatively small size of Lake Ohrid and the extremely small range of many endemic species, together with increasing human pressure make its fauna particularly vulnerable. It is thus hoped that this review will encourage future research on the ecology and evolutionary biology of the lake's taxa, the knowledge of which would ultimately help protecting this unique European biodiversity hot spot.

abstract={The Asian clam Corbicula fluminea, originating from Southeast Asia, was first recorded in Lake Constance in 2003 and developed local mass occurrences afterwards. Effects of harsh winter conditions in 2005/2006 associated with a strongly decreasing water level were studied at three different depths at and below the mean low water level (MLL, MLL <e2><88><92>1<c2><a0>m and MLL <e2><88><92>3<c2><a0>m). Low winter temperatures produced a massive die-off of the C.<c2><a0>fluminea population. The mortality of the clams was size class and depth dependent. At the mean low water level (MLL), all clams died because of lying dry. However, at MLL <e2><88><92>1<c2><a0>m and at MLL <e2><88><92>3<c2><a0>m, mortality was a consequence of water temperatures around 2<c2><b0>C for nearly 3<c2><a0>months. At MLL <e2><88><92>3<c2><a0>m, clams >5<c2><a0>mm died later than young clams <5<c2><a0>mm and later than clams of all sizes at MLL <e2><88><92>1<c2><a0>m. But in late spring even the clams >5<c2><a0>mm at MLL <e2><88><92>3<c2><a0>m were dead and only about 1% of the overall population of C.<c2><a0>fluminea survived the winter conditions until spring 2006.Lethal effects of low water temperatures on C.<c2><a0>fluminea, which may become effective only after a time lag, were corroborated in an outdoor mesocosm experiment with constant water level and without predation.},

title={Two cryptic species of the Hediste diversicolor group (Polychaeta, Nereididae) in the Baltic Sea, with mitochondrial signatures of different population histories},
abstract={A presence of two cryptic biological species of Hediste diversicolor complex polychaetes was corroborated in a geographical survey of some 30 populations from the eastern and southern coasts of the Baltic Sea, with data from four completely diagnostic allozyme characters. Species A was dominant in the northernmost part of the Baltic Hediste range (Bothnian Sea), whereas Species B alone was found in the south (Poland, Germany, Denmark). In the intervening region, comprising the majority of the sites studied in southern Finland and Estonia, the two species were usually found together, with no evidence of recent hybridisation (i.e., no heterozygote genotypes). While mitochondrial DNA also distinguished the two taxa, it was not similarly completely diagnostic, but there were rare cases (ca 5%) of lineage mismatch indicating that some introgression has occurred in the past. Comparison with published data suggests that species A also inhabits the North Sea-NE Atlantic-Mediterranean coasts, and species B is also present in the North Sea and the NW Atlantic (Canada). Within the Baltic, the two species show distinctly different patterns of mtDNA diversity, plausibly related to different colonisation histories. Species A shows a generally high haplotype and nucleotide diversity, whereas in species B we found only four deeply diverged groups of closely related haplotypes. Hypothetically this could indicate a recent expansion of species B from a small number of colonising individuals. Moreover, species B showed marked intraspecific geographical structuring, with co-incident genetic changes along the N Estonian-S Finnish coasts both in mtDNA and an allozyme marker; this pattern suggests a contact between two genetically distinct invasion waves of different origins. In all, species A and B represent good, reproductively isolated and partly sympatric species which require to be recognised in ecological work. A formal taxonomical description is needed, but awaits better, range-wide distributional and ecological characterisation and working out of morphological differences that enable a practical identification.

title={Microsatellite variation in the oyster Crassostrea plicatula along the coast of China},
abstract={Genetic diversity and differentiation of the oyster Crassostrea plicatula populations from China's coast were studied based on seven microsatellite loci. All loci showed high polymorphism for all five C. plicatula populations, with an average number of allele per locus of 19.3-27.9 and an average expected heterozygosity of 0.889-0.952. Significant departures from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and deficits of heterozygotes were observed over most populations at each locus, which were fully explained by null alleles. Microsatellite analysis revealed significant subdivision in the C. plicatula populations. According to the neighbor-joining tree constructed on the basis of the D A distance, the five populations fell into three regional groups, showing a relatively homogeneous genetic structure in geographically close populations. Assignation tests correctly assigned high percentages of individuals to their original populations and groups, and also confirmed the existence of genetic differentiation among C. plicatula populations. The results obtained in this study will facilitate the formulation of appropriate fisheries management programs, stock identification and conservation of biodiversity for the species.

Fischer This paper delivers a conceptual framework for the ecological functioning and biodiversity patterns of lakes that is based on the floodpulse concept (FPC). The specific characteristics of rivers and lakes considering water-level fluctuations are compared, with respect to catchment linkages, temporal patterns, and hydraulic forces of flooding and drawdown. The influences of floodpulses on element cycles, biodiversity, and adaptations of lake biota are analyzed, and the importance of multi-annual flooding cycles is highlighted. The degree by which these water-level fluctuations influence lake ecosystems strongly depends on lake morphology, where shallow lakes or those with large shallow margins are the most sensitive. Although floodpulses play a major role for ecosystem services such as lake management and climate change mitigation schemes, this issue is only scarcely dealt with. Tenets of the extended FPC for lakes are formulated in order to overcome this problem. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Based on the use of the hazard quotient approach, measured concentrations of chlorpyrifos and endosulfan in surface waters suggest potential hazards to aquatic organisms and were, therefore, considered as chemicals of potential ecological concern (COPECs). The problem formulation included an overview of the physical/chemical and environmental fate characteristics and aquatic toxicology of the COPECs. Background surface water exposure concentrations of endosulfan and toxicity data from laboratory and field studies indicate that fish and invertebrate mortality may be a concern when endosulfan is applied in agricultural areas near aquatic ecosystems.

abstract={This paper summarizes what is known about the endocrine systems of mollusks and how they can be disrupted by exogenous substances. It then examines the various possibilities for using mollusk-based toxicity tests to detect and assess the environmental risks of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). It is concluded that there are no internationally standardized tests with mollusks available at present that are suitable for assessing the risks of long-term exposure to EDCs but that several published methods show potential. At the present state of knowledge, the most promising mollusk species for use in partial life cycle testing is probably the fresh- and brackish-water mesogastropod, Potamopyrgus antipodarum, which is known to be responsive to both direct and indirect androgens and to estrogens (and their mimics). Less experience of full life cycle testing exists with mollusks, but the freshwater pulmonate gastropod Lymnaea stagnalis at present offers the best possibility for a practical procedure. In both cases, there is a need for substantial test optimization and validation before these procedures could form the basis of international guidelines. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Molecular identification key based on PCR/RFLP for three polychaete sibling species of the genus Marenzelleria, and the species' current distribution in the Baltic Sea},
abstract={Studies of Marenzelleria species were often hampered by identification uncertainties when using morphological characters only. A newly developed PCR/RFLP protocol allows a more efficient discrimination of the three species Marenzelleria viridis, Marenzelleria neglecta and Marenzelleria arctia currently known for the Baltic Sea. The protocol is based on PCR amplification of two mitochondrial DNA gene segments (16S, COI) followed by digestion with restriction enzymes. As it is faster and cheaper than PCR/sequencing protocols used so far, the protocol is recommended for large-scale analyses. The markers allow an undoubted determination of species irrespective of life stage or condition of the worms in the samples. The protocol was validated on about 950 specimens sampled at more than 30 sites of the Baltic and the North Sea, and on specimens from populations of the North American east coast. Besides this test we used mitochondrial DNA sequences (16S, COI, Cytb) and starch gel electrophoresis to further investigate the distribution of the three Marenzelleria species in the Baltic Sea. The results show that M. viridis (formerly genetic type I or M. cf. wireni) occurred in the <c3><96>resund area, in the south western as well as in the eastern Baltic Sea, where it is found sympatric with M. neglecta. Allozyme electrophoresis indicated an introduction by range expansion from the North Sea. The second species, M. arctia, was only found in the northern Baltic Sea, where it sometimes occurred sympatric with M. neglecta or M. viridis. For Baltic M. arctia, the most probable way of introduction is by ship ballast water from the European Arctic. There is an urgent need for a new genetic analysis of all Marenzelleria populations of the Baltic Sea to unravel the current distribution of the three species. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Issue Title: The Salton Sea Centennial Symposium. Proceedings of a Symposium Celebrating a Century of Symbiosis Among Agriculture, Wildlife and People, 1905-2005, held in San Diego, California, USA, March 2005 / Guest editor: Stuart H. Hurlbert The Salton Sea is one of the few saline, inland lakes in the world with a population of barnacles, Balanus amphitrite. It is also one of California's most impaired water bodies due to excessive nutrient loading which leads to phytoplankton blooms and low dissolved oxygen. Currently, B. amphitrite growth is limited due to lack of hard substrate in and around the Sea. We have hypothesized that artificial substrate could support the growth of B. amphitrite and their filter-feeding would lead to improved water quality. Periodic harvesting of the barnacles would result in the permanent removal of nitrogen and phosphorus from the Sea. A 44-day in-situ experiment was carried out in the Salton Sea to assess the rate of barnacle growth and phosphorus and nitrogen sequestration on burlap sheets suspended vertically from a floating line. Burlap panels were collected weekly and the barnacles analyzed for Ca, total-P, inorganic-P, total-N, total-C, CaCO3, and organic matter content. After 44<c2><a0>days of growth, the barnacle mats weighed 7.4<c2><a0>kg<c2><a0>m-2 on a dry weight basis, with 80% of the mass as shell material. The nutrient sequestration was 9.4<c2><a0>g<c2><a0>P<c2><a0>m-2 and 100<c2><a0>g<c2><a0>N<c2><a0>m-2. Approximately half of the P was inorganic and appears to be coprecipitated with the calcium carbonate shell material. Results indicate that harvesting barnacles grown on artificial substrate in the Salton Sea would not be an effective method for removing N or P from the lake because of the relative proportions of shell material and organic material.

title={Evaluation of DNA damage in Chinese toad (Bufo bufo gargarizans) after inÂ vivo exposure to sublethal concentrations of four herbicides using the comet assay},
abstract={Chinese toad, Bufo bufo gargarizans, is frequently found in rice fields, muddy ponds, wetlands and other aquatic ecosystems in China. Because of its habitat, it has many chances of being exposed to pesticides, such as acetochlor, butachlor, chlorimuron-ethyl, and paraquat, which are extensively used in rice or cereal fields. Amphibians may serve as model organisms for determining the genotoxic effects of pollutants contaminating these areas. In the present study DNA damage was evaluated in the Chinese toad using the comet assay, as a potential tool for the assessment of ecogenotoxicity. The first step was to determine the acute toxicity of the above-mentioned herbicides. In acute tests, tadpoles were exposed to a series of relatively high concentrations of acetochlor, butachlor, chlorimuron-ethyl, and paraquat for 96<c2><a0>h. The LC 50 (96<c2><a0>h) of acetochlor, butachlor, chlorimuron-ethyl and paraquat were measured as 0.76, 1.32, 20.1 and 164<c2><a0>mg<c2><b7>l-1, respectively. Also, negative effects on the behavior of tadpoles were observed with acetochlor, butachlor, and paraquat. Secondly, the comet assay was used for detecting DNA damage in Chinese toad tadpoles exposed to sublethal concentrations of four herbicides. Significant ( P<c2><a0><<c2><a0>0.05) concentration-dependent increase in DNA damage (as indicated by tail length, tail moment, olive tail moment) were observed from erythrocytes of tadpoles exposed to sublethal concentrations of acetochlor, butachlor, paraquat, and methyl methanesulfonate, except chlorimuron-ethyl. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the use of Bufo bufo gargarizans for genotoxicity assessment of herbicides. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Allochthonous litter inputs, organic matter standing stocks, and organic seston dynamics in upland Panamanian streams: potential effects of larval amphibians on organic matter dynamics},
abstract={Allochthonous inputs of detritus represent an important energy source for streams in forested regions, but dynamics of these materials are not well studied in neotropical headwater streams. As part of the tropical amphibian declines in streams (TADS) project, we quantified benthic organic matter standing stocks and organic seston dynamics in four Panamanian headwater streams, two with (pre-amphibian decline) and two without (post-decline) healthy amphibian assemblages. We also measured direct litterfall and lateral litter inputs in two of these streams. Continuous litterfall and monthly benthic samples were collected for 1<c2><a0>year, and seston was collected 1-3<c2><a0>times/month for 1<c2><a0>year at or near baseflow. Direct litterfall was similar between the two streams examined, ranging from 934-1,137<c2><a0>g DM m-2<c2><a0>y-1. Lateral inputs were lower, ranging from 140-187<c2><a0>g DM m-1<c2><a0>y-1. Dead leaves (57-60%), wood (24-29%), and green leaves (8-9%) contributed most to inputs, and total inputs were generally higher during the rainy season. Annual habitat-weighted benthic organic matter standing stocks ranged from 101-171<c2><a0>g AFDM m-2 across the four study reaches, with 4<c2><a0><c3><97><c2><a0>higher values in pools compared to erosional habitats. Total benthic organic matter (BOM) values did not change appreciably with season, but coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM, >1<c2><a0>mm) generally decreased and very fine particulate organic matter (VFPOM, 1.6-250<c2><a0><ce><bc>m) generally increased during the dry season. Average annual seston concentrations ranged from 0.2-0.6<c2><a0>mg AFDM l-1 (fine seston, <754<c2><a0><ce><bc>m >250<c2><a0><ce><bc>m) and 2.0-4.7<c2><a0>mg AFDM l-1 (very fine, <250<c2><a0><ce><bc>m >1.6<c2><a0><ce><bc>m), with very fine particles composing 85-92% of total seston. Quality of fine seston particles in the two reaches where tadpoles were present was significantly higher (lower C/N) than the two where tadpoles had been severely reduced (P<c2><a0>=<c2><a0>0.0028), suggesting that ongoing amphibian declines in this region are negatively influencing the quality of particles exported from headwaters. Compared to forested streams in other regions, these systems receive relatively high amounts of allochthonous litter inputs but have low in-stream storage. (PUBLICATION ABSTRACT)},

title={Guidance for Evaluating In Vivo Fish Bioaccumulation Data},
abstract={Currently, the laboratory-derived fish bioconcentration factor (BCF) serves as one of the primary data sources used to assess the potential for a chemical to bioaccumulate. Consequently, fish BCF values serve a central role in decision making and provide the basis for development of quantitative structure-property relationships (QSPRs) used to predict the bioaccumulation potential of untested compounds. However, practical guidance for critically reviewing experimental BCF studies is limited. This lack of transparent guidance hinders improvement in predictive models and can lead to uninformed chemical management decisions. To address this concern, a multiple-stakeholder workshop of experts from government, industry, and academia was convened by the International Life Sciences Institute Health and Environmental Sciences Institute to examine the data availability and quality issues associated with in vivo fish bioconcentration and bioaccumulation data. This paper provides guidance for evaluating key aspects of study design and conduct that must be considered when judging the reliability and adequacy of reported laboratory bioaccumulation data. Key criteria identified for judging study reliability include 1) clear specification of test substance and fish species investigated, 2) analysis of test substance in both fish tissue and exposure medium, 3) no significant adverse effects on exposed test fish, and 4) a reported test BCF that reflects steady-state conditions with unambiguous units. This guidance is then applied to 2 data-rich chemicals (anthracene and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin) to illustrate the critical need for applying a systematic data quality assessment process. Use of these guidelines will foster development of more accurate QSPR models, improve the performance and reporting of future laboratory studies, and strengthen the technical basis for bioaccumulation assessment in chemicals management.

title={Are Late-Spring Boreal Lesser Scaup (Aythya Affinis) in Poor Body Condition},
abstract={In many waterfowl species, females in better body condition have greater reproductive success than those in poor condition; thus, large-scale changes in body condition could influence species' population dynamics. Indices of annual productivity have decreased in Lesser Scaup (Aythya affinis ), and the "spring condition" hypothesis (SCH) has been proposed to account for poor production and low populations in this species. We compared nutrient reserves of female Lesser Scaup and Ring-necked Ducks (A. collaris ) collected during the breeding season at multiple sites in the Canadian boreal forest, the region where ~70% of both species breed and where they have had contrasting population trends for the past 25 years. Lesser Scaup tended to carry greater somatic lipid but slightly lower protein reserves than Ring-necked Ducks, after controlling for size. The proportion of females developing follicles was similar in both species, though Lesser Scaup initiated egg development later and exhibited less temporal variance in nesting date than Ring-necked Ducks. We also directly tested the SCH by comparing contemporary arrival and prebreeding body masses of Lesser Scaup with historical values at one boreal-forest site. However, body masses of Lesser Scaup collected in 2003-2004 were comparable to those of Lesser Scaup collected at Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, during 1968-1970. Overall, our results suggest that currently, body condition of boreal-breeding Lesser Scaup is relatively similar to that of Ring-necked Ducks and to historical levels for Lesser Scaup. Future studies of factors that limit recovery of Lesser Scaup should examine migration patterns and the effects of climate change on the timing of both energetic requirements in Lesser Scaup and food-resource availability.

These sources have impacted lake ecosystems over a number of years in various combinations and often in a spatially heterogeneous pattern. At the same time, many different kinds of mathematical models have been developed to help to understand ecosystem processes and improve cost-effective management. Here, the advantages and limitations of models and sources of uncertainty will be discussed. From these considerations and in view of the multiple environmental pressures, the following emerging issues still have to be met in order to improve the understanding of ecosystem function and management of large lakes: (1) the inclusion of thresholds and points-of-no-return; (2) construction of general models to simulate biogeochemical processes for a large number of lakes rather than for individual systems; (3) improvement of the understanding of spatio-temporal variability to quantify biogeochemical fluxes accurately; and (4) inclusion of biogeochemical linkages between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in model approaches to assess the effects of external environmental pressures such as land-use changes. The inclusion of the above-mentioned issues would substantially improve models as tools for the scientific understanding and cost-effective management of large lakes that are subject to multiple environmental pressures in a changing future.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={The effect of selection treatments on Mytilus edulis, modifications of genetic and physiological characteristics},
abstract={This study examined the effects of two selection treatments (elevated water temperature and air exposure) on the genetic and physiological characteristics of the juvenile marine mussel, Mytilus edulis (<10 mm). Genetic effects were measured on five allozymes and fitness assessed using physiological tests to estimate energy balance (scope for growth) as well as size, growth and survival. The in vitro treatments resulted in 48% mortality from an air exposure of 11 h at 27 degrees C and 76% mortality from a 6-h exposure to 33 degrees C water. Survivors (n = 1,152) of each treatment along with controls (n = 2,304) were measured and randomly placed in compartmentalized cages. Mussels were deployed to three bays in Prince Edward Island, Canada and monitored over a 10-month period. Initially, both of the treatments had an effect on mussel size and increased the heterozygosity of the surviving mussels. Physiological analyses after 3 months in the field showed that the two treated mussels showed lower metabolic rate that the control group. After 10 months in the field, the treated mussels were larger and had lower mortality than the untreated control mussels. Unexplained environmental interaction in each of the bays had an effect on allelic frequencies and heterozygosity. Overall, the results demonstrate that simple husbandry techniques can be used to increase the productivity of mussel seed and heterozygosity measures can be used to assess fitness. However, more field data is needed to determine the consistency of the increased productivity and if the increased productivity justifies the costs of a selective treatment. Furthermore, because the level of heterozygosity in juvenile mussel populations can vary considerably, both spatially and temporally, it may be effective as a warning of future natural mass mortality when overall heterozygosity levels are found to be low.

title={Patterns of prey use by lesser scaup Aythya affinis (Aves) and diet overlap with fishes during spring migration},
abstract={Recent decline in the lesser scaup Aythya affinis population has been linked to changes in wetland conditions along their spring migration routes. In particular, the use of amphipod prey by lesser scaup has declined in many regions of the upper Midwest U.S.A. and has been linked to expanded fisheries, although empirical data on diet overlap are lacking. To explore patterns of prey use by lesser scaup and diet overlap with fishes, we quantified diets of scaup and fishes during the 2003 and 2004 spring migration in eastern South Dakota, U.S.A. We compared diet overlap between lesser scaup and fishes collected from Twin Lakes, South Dakota--an important stopover location for spring-migrating scaup. Plant seeds occurred in >95% of lesser scaup diets (n<c2><a0>=<c2><a0>118) and represented an appreciable amount of consumed biomass (>70%). Gastropods, amphipods, and chironomids were the most abundant invertebrate prey taxa and occurred in 29-34% of lesser scaup diets. Although relatively frequent, these taxa each contributed only 4-27% of the diet by weight. Percent dry mass of amphipods, a preferred prey by lesser scaup, was low (4%) indicating that amphipod availability may be reduced during spring migration. Analysis of fish diets showed that black bullhead Ameiurus melas and yellow perch Perca flavescens had the highest diet overlap with lesser scaup at 94% and 92%, respectively. Moreover, mean size of amphipods and chironomids found in fish diets were significantly larger than that consumed by lesser scaup. Our findings support the notion that amphipod use by spring-migrating lesser scaup has declined and that size-selective predation by fishes may influence prey availability for lesser scaup.

The study was carried out in western Sicily, where B. pharaonis is present on both the submerged and emerged surfaces of a hyperhaline saltpan. Individuals were scraped, counted and measured for shell length, total weight, somatic, gonadic and shell biomass. Brachidontes pharaonis intensively colonized all hard substrates of the saltpan with annual average densities of 375<c2><a0><c2><b1><c2><a0>293 ind. 400<c2><a0>cm-2 with density peaks in autumn as a function of habitat. The occurrence of juveniles was different for mediolittoral and infralittoral populations as was mean size, spawning periods and annual organic matter biomass. Organic matter allocated to the shells represented 56.4% (of the total), gonad allocation was 7.3%, while somatic allocation averaged 36.3% for both populations. Brachidontes pharaonis reached high individual density, rare among temperate members of the genus Mytilus in Mediterranean and European waters, but common in tropical dense mussel beds. Considering its invasive potential and the recent warming trend of the Mediterranean, in the future B. pharaonis may actively invade more habitats, threatening indigenous bivalve species which may be unable to compete with B. pharaonis in terms of reproductive effort and density.

title={Ontogenetic changes in small-scale movement by recruits of an exploited mussel: implications for the fate of larvae settling on algae},
abstract={Many South African populations of the brown mussel Perna perna have been depleted through over-exploitation by subsistence harvesters. This is problematic because recovery after disturbance is very slow, partly because recruits are largely associated with adult mussels. However, unlike large recruits of 3.5-10 mm that exhibit spatial structure related to that of adults, a very high proportion of settlers and small recruits (0-3.5 mm) occur on foliose algae. We tested the hypothesis that recruits on algae move to adult mussel beds after a period of growth, with the null hypothesis that they die at a certain size. We conducted an indirect field study comparing the ratios of large to small recruits in 100% cover mussel patches at locations with high and low algal cover. A second laboratory experiment analysed whether the size of recruits on algae affects their active movement behaviour in response to nearby mussel patches. Large/small recruit ratios were slightly, but not significantly greater in high than low algal cover locations. Both small (2-2.5 mm) and medium (4.5-5.5 mm) recruits remained on algae and moved very short distances throughout the laboratory experiment, while larger recruits (9-10 mm) moved significantly further distances and more often into mussel patches. The results suggest that very large recruits are able to migrate actively to nearby mussel patches, indicating ontogenetic shifts in this behaviour. However, the absence of a significant difference in ratios between field locations with high and low algal cover suggests many large recruits are accidentally dislodged from the algae and presumably die. Thus settlement of P. perna onto algae is likely to be wasted, with consequences for sustainable management of the mussel resource. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Impact of exotic invasive species in the cooling network of the Cartuja'93 technological park (Seville)},
abstract={EMASESA has been monitoring the biological colonization in the Cartuja Island raw water network since 2001. Water from the Guadalquivir River dock, which circulates through this network, is meant for irrigation of the green areas and for the air conditioning of the buildings in the Cartuja 93 Science and Technology Park. The results of this study have highlighted that in the biological colonization of the distribution network three exotic invasive species are involved: the bivalves Mytilopsis leucophaeata and Corbicula fluminea, along with the hydrozoan Cordylophora caspia. The colonization is principally registered at the beginning of the network in the pumping station facilities. The C. caspia and M. leucophaeata have experienced the biggest growth, and the hydrozoan has had the biggest effect on the distribution network. The biological growth in the network has been tackled in two ways: (1) eliminating the existing colonization i.e. acting on the adult specimens while manually cleaning the larger diameter pipes and (2) preventing new outbreaks by using a non-oxidizing and fast hydrolysing biocide and using a TBT-free anti-fouling paint.},

abstract={Presque Isle Bay is one of 40 remaining environmental areas of concern (AoCs) on the North American Great Lakes that have one or more water, habitat, or sediment quality impairments as defined by the International Joint Commission. In situ natural capping using sediment from to-be-remediated watersheds and other potential sources is being considered as the most feasible means of remediating an existing contaminated sediment problem at this site. A multi-decade (40<c2><a0>year) sediment budget shows that, when localized anthropogenic effects (dredging, reclamation) are discounted, the bay net-accumulated sediment over time. Sediment was supplied from three major sources: bank erosion and bluff retreat (41%), streams (25%), and the Lake Erie littoral system (20%). The non-stream sources supply environmentally clean materials from ancient beach and glacio-lacustrine deposits along the shoreline, and from the modern littoral system. Organic and metallic contaminants supplied primarily by streams and run-off remain a remediation challenge for the AoC. Geologically, natural capping of contaminants over the next several decades is a viable solution for most of the bay. The mechanism may not work effectively in all areas because approximately 25% of the bay floor is moderately net-erosional while several localized areas accumulate sediments very slowly at decadal timescales.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Sampling was conducted during morning, afternoon, and night in each year. Catches per hour (CPH) of alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) YOY were relatively low and exhibited no temporal trend. This result was consistent with the species<e2><80><99> intolerance to Lake Erie<e2><80><99>s adverse winter water temperatures. Gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum) YOY decreased sharply after 1991, which was consistent with recent oligotrophication of the lake. Following the establishment in 1979 and rapid increase of white perch (Morone americana) YOY, white bass (Morone chrysops) and freshwater drum (Aplodinotus grunniens) YOY decreased. Trout-perch (Percopsis omiscomaycus) YOY decreased during 1986<e2><80><93>1991, but recovered to previous levels during 1991<e2><80><93>2001. The recovery coincided with the resurgence of mayflies (Ephemoptera) in the lake. CPH of spottail shiner (Notropis hudsonius) and emerald shiner (N. atherinoides) YOY exhibited no temporal trend between 1961 and the late 1970s to early 1980s. CPH of yellow perch (Perca flavescens) YOY decreased during 1961<e2><80><93>1988, and walleye (Sander vitreum) YOY increased overall during the time series. These observations were consistent with published studies of adults in the region. CPH of 4 of the 10 species of YOY considered were greatest during night. CPH for walleye YOY was higher in the morning than in the afternoon, but there was no significant difference between night and morning abundances. The results suggest that (1) CPH of YOY fishes may be a useful monitoring tool for Lake Erie, and (2) offshore monitoring programs that do not include night sampling periods may underestimate recruitment for several common species.},

title={Conservation of Aquatic Resources through the Use of Freshwater Protected Areas: Opportunities and Challenges},
abstract={Freshwater environments are currently experiencing an alarming decline in biodiversity. As a result, scientists and managers must look for alternative management techniques to protect these aquatic systems. One such option that has potential to protect freshwater environments from numerous threats is the use of freshwater protected areas (FPAs). FPAs are portions of the freshwater environment partitioned to minimize disturbances and allow natural processes to govern populations and ecosystems. While similar conservation practices are well established in the terrestrial and marine environments, the use of FPAs for conservation of freshwater environments has been relatively slow. Despite this, numerous examples exist in which FPAs have been incorporated into successful management approaches for freshwater environments. In this paper, we outline some of the past success stories where FPAs have been used to protect freshwater environments, discuss some of the reasons that this technique has not proliferated to the same degree as marine protected areas, and present some of the challenges that managers and scientists must overcome if they wish to implement FPAs. We recommend that the term Freshwater Protected Area be adopted to such conservation efforts, thereby standardizing terminology and facilitating literature searches and dissemination of research findings. Furthermore, we encourage freshwater scientists, conservationists and managers to develop and implement FPAs in innovative and creative situations thereby permitting the growth of the research base for this valuable conservation technique.},

title={Pollution-induced heat shock protein expression in the amphipod Gammarus roeseli is affected by larvae of Polymorphus minutus (Acanthocephala)},
abstract={Abstract The relationship between the exposure of organisms to chemicals and subsequent alterations in various biochemical processes (commonly referred to as biomarkers) is of growing importance in environmental and ecotoxicological research. However, parasites which also affect the physiological homeostasis of their hosts, and thus may alter biomarker reactions, are usually ignored in environmental research. To address this deficit, we have used the host-parasite system Gammarus roeseli naturally infected with cystacanths of the acanthocephalan Polymorphus minutus to investigate whether infection of gammarids with parasites alters their heat shock protein response following exposure to palladium (Pd). After 24 days of metal exposure relative levels of heat shock protein hsp70 were analysed in the tissues of parasites and intermediate hosts. Simultaneously, the metal accumulation in gammarids and parasites was determined. As none of the infected gammarids showed hsp70 levels at the end of the Pd exposure (either exposed or not), infected and unparasitized G. roeseli were exposed to heat. Again, only uninfected gammarids showed a temperature-dependent increase in hsp70 levels. Interestingly, although the intermediate hosts showed no hsp70 response, exposure to Pd and heat results in increasing hsp70 in the parasites within in the haemocoel of G. roeseli. Heat experiments with isolated cystacanths also showed increasing hsp70 levels in P. minutus with temperature. Concerning uninfected G. roeseli, exposure to Pd and heat causes a hsp70 response. Pd concentrations were found to be higher in the larval parasites than in the gammarids. This result clearly contradicts previous results, as high metal accumulation was so far only described from adult acanthocephalans. Our findings provide experimental evidence that parasites alter the biomarker responses of their host and that the infection status of test animals is extremely important for ecotoxicological studies.

title={Environmental Stress Determines the Quality of Bacterial Lysate and Its Utilization Efficiency in a Simple Microbial Loop},
abstract={Heterotrophic bacteria provide the critical link in the microbial loop by converting dissolved organic matter (DOM) into particulate form. In this study, DOM was prepared from recently isolated estuarine bacterial strain Vibrio sp. (DSM14379) grown at different salinities [0.2%, 0.5%, 3%, 5%, or 10% (w/v)], washed, concentrated, and lysed by autoclaving. The corresponding lysate-containing media were designated LM0.2, LM0.5, LM3, LM5, and LM10. Vibrio sp. cells grown at different salinities had similar C/N/P ratios, but different C/S ratios, different trace element composition, and different 2D gel electrophoresis protein profiles. Pseudoalteromonas sp. (DSM06238) isolated from a similar environment was able to grow on all lysates, and its biomass production was dependent on lysate type. The highest growth rate and biomass production of Pseudoalteromonas sp. at saturation lysate concentrations were observed in LM3. The biomass production at saturation lysate concentrations was about 3-fold higher as compared to LM0.2 and LM10. The initial respiration rate, intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, and 3H-Leu and 3H-TdR incorporation rates were lowest in LM3. On the other hand, in LM0.2 or LM10 lysates the situation was reversed, the growth rates and biomass production were lowest, whereas 3H-Leu and 3H-TdR incorporation, respiration rates, as well as ATP levels, were highest. These results imply uncoupling of catabolism from growth in either high- or low-salinity lysates. The results also suggest that differences in organic carbon quality generated during Vibrio sp. growth at different NaCl concentrations were propagated through the simple microbial loop, which may have important ecological implications for higher trophic levels that depend on microbial grazing.},

In this critical review, we explore the information provided by aquatic in situ exposure and monitoring methods when compared with more traditional approaches and discuss the associated strengths and limitations of these techniques. In situ approaches can, under some circumstances, provide more valuable information to a decision maker than information from surveys of resident biota, laboratory toxicity tests, or chemical analyses alone.

title={Importance of heterotrophic planktonic communities in a mussel culture environment: the Grande Entree lagoon, Magdalen Islands (Quebec, Canada)},
abstract={Mussel culture in coastal environments relies on the availability of food of sufficient quality and quantity. Both to determine this availability and to examine impacts that this aquaculture practice may have on the environment, it is important to have good knowledge of the type of plankton communities present in aquaculture sites. It is usually thought that phytoplankton make up the bulk of mussel diet in many of these sites. Here we show that the Grande-Entree lagoon [Magdalen Islands, Gulf of St Lawrence (GSL), Canada], where commercial mussel culture has been on-going since 1980, differs from this pattern. Heterotrophic protists dominate for most of the summer-early fall season (apart from short diatom bursts), with a high average biomass of 160 mg C m-3. The dominance of small-sized phytoplankton cells (notably green algae), low nutrient concentrations (e.g. 0.3 mcM NO3- on average) and high biomass of heterotrophic protists (mostly naked ciliates and tintinnids) all point to the importance of the microbial food web in this shallow marine environment. Sustained cultivation of suspended mussels in the lagoon suggests that these heterotrophic protists could be an important source of food for the mussels, supplementing the small amount of phytoplankton present.

title={A comparison of biofilms from macrophytes and rocks for taste and odour producers in the St. Lawrence River},
abstract={Given their widespread and prolific annual development in the St. Lawrence River (SLR), macrophytes (i.e. submerged aquatic plants) represent large surface areas for biofilm growth and potentially important sites for associated production of taste and odour (T&O) compounds. We therefore evaluated the importance of submerged macrophytes and their associated biofilms for production of T&O compounds, 2-methylisoborneol (MIB) and geosmin (GM), compared with biofilms from adjacent rocks. We also tested the hypothesis that production of these compounds would differ between macrophyte species, based on the premise that they are not inert substrates but directly influence the communities that colonise their surfaces. Samples collected from transects across the SLR between Kingston and Cornwall, ON were dominated by the flat-bladed Vallisneria spp., and the leafed Myriophyllum spicatum, Elodea canadensis, Chara spp., Potamgeton spp., and Ceratophyllum spp. Overall, MIB and GM levels in biofilms ranged widely between samples. Expressed per g dry weight of biofilm, median levels from macrophyte were 50 (range 1-5,000) ng MIB g<e2><88><92>1 and 10 (<1 to 580) ng GM g<e2><88><92>1 compared with 50 (range 5-970) ng MIB g<e2><88><92>1 and 160 (1-1,600) ng GM g<e2><88><92>1 from rocks. Based on non-parametric statistical analysis, levels of GM were higher on a g dry weight basis in biofilms from rocks than macrophytes (P=0.02), but MIB levels were similar (P=0.94). However, when normalised for differences in substrate surface area (i.e. ng cm<e2><88><92>2), levels of both MIB and GM were higher in biofilms from rocks than from macrophytes (P<0.01). There were no discernable differences in MIB and GM concentrations from biofilms of different macrophytes based on either g dry weight sample or surface area (P>0.05). Overlying water (OLW) concentrations ranged between 2-45<e2><80><89>ng<e2><80><89>L<e2><88><92>1 for MIB and 5-30<e2><80><89>ng<e2><80><89>L<e2><88><92>1 for GM and were not correlated with levels in adjacent biofilms. However, OLW concentrations peaked in shallow, low energy embayments consistent with enhanced production and release of MIB and GM in nearshore areas. The results support our previous work showing the importance of biofilms on various surfaces (rocks, macrophytes and zebra mussels) for MIB and GM production in the SLR, but suggest that inert surfaces like rocks are more productive sites per unit surface area than macrophytes.},

Shell form, maximum age (8 years) and percentage of organic matter in the shell and soft tissues were similar in both lakes. However, comparisons between same size classes revealed that mussels from Lake Maggiore were generally older, their shells heavier and their soft tissues lighter than those from Lake Candia. Recruitment occurred in both populations in June-July. The frequency distributions of adult mussels (>30 mm) and their soft tissues and shell biomasses in all size classes (range = 2 mm) were normal, but the curves of the mussels from Lake Candia were flat in comparison to those of mussels from Lake Maggiore. The median body size of Lake Maggiore mussels was 58 mm, while that of the Lake Candia population was 72 mm. During the study period the population density of each lake was fairly constant, whereas the population structure, and consequently the biomass, showed seasonal variations. The greatest differences were found between population density and shell and tissue biomass of the two populations, which were respectively 46.86 ind. m-2; 408 g d.w. m-2 and 38.67 g d.w. m-2 in Lake Maggiore, and 6.93 ind. m-2; 92.29 g d.w. m-2 and 14.04 g d.w. m-2 in Lake Candia. These values testify to the phenotypical plasticity of Unio pictorum mancus in relation to environmental characteristics, without excluding a possible genetic influence as a result of geographical isolation and the respective selection mechanisms. The influence exerted by the lake trophic level and by the physical environment on some population characteristics is discussed.},

title={HYDROLOGIC CONNECTIVITY AND THE CONTRIBUTION OF STREAM HEADWATERS TO ECOLOGICAL INTEGRITY AT REGIONAL SCALES1},
abstract={Cumulatively, headwater streams contribute to maintaining hydrologic connectivity and ecosystem integrity at regional scales. Hydrologic connectivity is the water-mediated transport of matter, energy and organisms within or between elements of the hydrologic cycle. Headwater streams compose over two-thirds of total stream length in a typical river drainage and directly connect the upland and riparian landscape to the rest of the stream ecosystem. Altering headwater streams, e.g., by channelization, diversion through pipes, impoundment and burial, modifies fluxes between uplands and downstream river segments and eliminates distinctive habitats. The large-scale ecological effects of altering headwaters are amplified by land uses that alter runoff and nutrient loads to streams, and by widespread dam construction on larger rivers (which frequently leaves free-flowing upstream portions of river systems essential to sustaining aquatic biodiversity). We discuss three examples of large-scale consequences of cumulative headwater alteration. Downstream eutrophication and coastal hypoxia result, in part, from agricultural practices that alter headwaters and wetlands while increasing nutrient runoff. Extensive headwater alteration is also expected to lower secondary productivity of river systems by reducing stream-system length and trophic subsidies to downstream river segments, affecting aquatic communities and terrestrial wildlife that utilize aquatic resources. Reduced viability of freshwater biota may occur with cumulative headwater alteration, including for species that occupy a range of stream sizes but for which headwater streams diversify the network of interconnected populations or enhance survival for particular life stages. Developing a more predictive understanding of ecological patterns that may emerge on regional scales as a result of headwater alterations will require studies focused on components and pathways that connect headwaters to river, coastal and terrestrial ecosystems. Linkages between headwaters and downstream ecosystems cannot be discounted when addressing large-scale issues such as hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico and global losses of biodiversity.

title={Integrative ecosystem analyses of phytoplankton dynamics in the York River estuary (USA)},
abstract={The relative importance of biotic (top-down) vs. abiotic (bottom-up) controls on phytoplankton dynamics was investigated in the York River estuary, Virginia (USA) by a combination of extensive analyses of long-term data sets collected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) monitoring program over 17<c2><a0>years (1984<e2><80><93>2001), field studies (1996<e2><80><93>1997) and ecosystem modeling analyses. Results from the analysis of long-term data records collected at three stations along the salinity gradient suggested that phytoplankton are more likely controlled by abiotic mechanisms such as resource limitation than biotic mechanisms such as grazing since annual cycles of primary production and phytoplankton biomass were similar and no grazing effects were evident based on the observed relationship between phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass (R2 < 0.2, p > 0.1). This scenario was supported by short-term field observations made over an annual cycle at three stations in the mid-channel of the estuary where both chlorophyll a and primary production demonstrated similar patterns of seasonal variation. Ratios of fluorescence before and after acidification at all study sites were relatively high suggesting low grazing pressure in the estuary. A tidally-averaged, size-structured plankton ecosystem model was previously developed and verified for the lower York River estuary. The validated ecosystem model was also used to examine this issue and simulation results supported the importance of bottom-up control in the York River estuary.},

title={Biomarkers and Integrated Environmental Risk Assessment: Are There More Questions Than Answers?},
abstract={The introduction of the European Commission's Water Framework Directive (WFD; 2000/60/EC) established a new era in environmental risk assessment. In addition to incorporating the compliance of chemical quality standards, the key objective of the WFD is the general protection of the aquatic environment in its entirety. This new approach emphasizes the need for an integrated environmental risk assessment and offers the potential for the incorporation of biological effects measures, including the use of biomarkers in this process. Biomarkers have been suggested as practical tools for environmental management for a number of decades, but their inclusion has not been universally accepted because of a number of unanswered questions regarding sensitivity, practicality, and reproducibility. With this in mind, this paper addresses these potential questions and shows how, by taking a weight-of-evidence approach, biomarkers may be successfully incorporated within environmental risk assessment frameworks such as the WFD.

abstract={Significant anthropogenic pressure in the Dutch part of the River Rhine is present from the 12th century. River engineering and water pollution were the main stress factors for flora and fauna. From the middle of the 20th century measures were taken to reduce water pollution. Recently, from 1987 onwards, these activities were put into a wider context of ecological river rehabilitation. Effects of improvements on fish and macroinvertebrates in the main distributaries in the Rhine delta are reviewed. The conclusions are that (a) most of the alterations in the Rhine delta are irreversible due to hard socio-economic boundary conditions (e.g. safety, navigation); (b) chances for the development of riverine biotopes have therefore to be found in the forelands and not in the main channels of the Rhine delta; (c) further reduction of pollutants, especially thermal pollution, is needed to help original species to colonise the Rhine delta again; (d) non-indigenous species clearly leave a mark on recolonisation possibilities of original species.},

abstract={The occurrence of dissolved heavy metal concentrations in shallow ground water were measured at 126 sites within an urban watershed in southeastern Michigan. A total of 1,140 samples were collected from the first saturated zone, and the mean concentrations of 11 heavy metals (arsenic, barium, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, mercury, nickel, selenium, silver, and zinc) were obtained and compared to their corresponding mean concentrations within surface soil. The results suggest that former and current land use processes have resulted in significant adverse impacts on the study region.. Levels of Cr 20 to 30 times the maximum contaminant level (MCL) have been detected in the ground water beneath industrial sites. In addition, Cd and Pb have been found at levels exceeding their MCLs where surface soils are clay-rich, and in sandy soils at more than 10 times their MCLs. The high levels of Cr in ground water strongly suggest that the chromium is in a hexavalent form, and this likelihood is supported by current studies. Given the hydraulic connection between the watershed's surface waters and the Great Lakes, these findings raise significant ecological and public health concerns. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={The impact of food supply on phosphorus recycling by dreissenids mussels},
abstract={Subsequent to the dreissenid mussels invasion in the Great Lakes there has been a reorganization of the nearshore ecosystem. One notable change is the increased biomass of the benthic macroalgae community. Phosphorus being a limiting resource within the Great Lakes, it has been suggested that phosphorus recycling by dreissenid mussels may contribute to this recent resurgence of benthic algae. Because phosphorus recycling by a consumer is dependent on the phosphorus content of the food and the phosphorus content of the consumers tissues, we hypothesized that phytoplankton concentration is a critical factor affecting the recycling of phosphorus by dreissenids. We conducted a series of experiments to determine the relationship between food supply and phosphorus recycling by dreissenids mussels. Initial results suggest that there is an inverse relationship between dreissenid phosphorus excretion rates and algae concentrations. A possible reason for this non-intuitive relationship is the dissolution of dreissenid tissue due to the affects of starvation.},

title={Preservation of Autochthonous Shell Beds by Positive Feedback between Increased Hardpart-Input Rates and Increased Sedimentation Rates},
abstract={The preservation of nonrapidly buried autochthonous shell concentrations with noncementing epifaunal animals in life position presents a taphonomic dilemma if in fact an increase in shelliness is driven by a decrease in sedimentation rate. A 150-cm-thick, densely packed shell bed with brachiopods from the Lower Jurassic of Morocco shows lower levels of postmortem alteration than shell-poor beds, indicating that its formation is primarily governed by variations in hardpart-input rates. Varying dominance and size structure of the main shell producer, brachiopod Zeilleria rehmanni, indicate that its increased population density was the main trigger in the shell bed formation. Thinner and less common microbial crusts in the shell bed than in shell-poor beds indicate that higher shelliness is not due to lack of sediment. On the basis of actualistic data from modern mussel and oyster shell beds, the suspension feeding of a high-density population leads to high biodeposition rates through production of feces and pseudofeces, which substantially exceed natural sedimentation rates. In addition, shell-rich areas preferentially trap more suspended sediment than shell-poor areas. Therefore, an increase in population density of shelly biodeposit producers should lead to higher biodeposition rates. This assumption is supported by a positive correlation between brachiopod shelliness and pellet abundance. Both active biodeposition and passive trapping of sediment would have increased sedimentation rate, thus leading to a decreased rate of shell destruction through suppression of predators or borers as well as stabilization and protection of the shell concentration. Under optimum ecologic conditions, these processes result in a positive feedback between an increased hardpart-input rate and increased biogenic sedimentation rate. This scenario thus provides one alternative pathway for formation of well-preserved shell concentrations formed by epifaunal suspension feeders. Identifying the importance of biodeposition is of environmental significance because it implies that carbonate sediment was produced largely in situ and was directly or indirectly related to the activity of shell producers. Recognizing the role of varying hardpart-input rates in shell concentration genesis is of ecologic significance because shelliness can directly reflect abundance fluctuations of shell producers.

abstract={Abstract Over the past 30 years the coconut mite Aceria guerreronis Keifer has emerged as one of the most important pests of coconut and has recently spread to most coconut production areas worldwide. The mite has not been recorded in the Indo-Pacific region, the area of origin of coconut, suggesting that it has infested coconut only recently. To investigate the geographical origin, ancestral host associations, and colonization history of the mite, DNA sequence data from two mitochondrial and one nuclear region were obtained from samples of 29 populations from the Americas, Africa and the Indo-ocean region. Mitochondrial DNA 16S ribosomal sequences were most diverse in Brazil, which contained six of a total of seven haplotypes. A single haplotype was shared by non-American mites. Patterns of nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) variation were similar, again with the highest nucleotide diversity found in Brazil. These results suggest an American origin of the mite and lend evidence to a previous hypothesis that the original host of the mite is a non-coconut palm. In contrast to the diversity in the Americas, all samples from Africa and Asia were identical or very similar, consistent with the hypothesis that the mite invaded these regions recently from a common source. Although the invasion routes of this mite are still only partially reconstructed, the study rules out coconut as the ancestral host of A. guerreronis, thus prompting a reassessment of efforts using quarantine and biological control to check the spread of the pest.

title={Community analysis of Belarusian lakes: relationship of species diversity to morphology, hydrology and land use},
abstract={In the glacial lake district of northern Belarus, limnologists collected extensive biological, chemical and physical data on 550 lakes (51% of all Belarusian glacial lakes). This large data set provided a unique opportunity to examine subtle relationships with great statistical power. Our purpose was to use multivariate and correlation analyses to explore relationships of species richness with morphological and hydrological parameters. A multivariate analysis of the environmental data suggests that the Belarusian lakes can be separated along gradients of size, hydraulic residence time and watershed development (land use). In most instances, species richness for major planktonic and benthic groups was correlated significantly with lake size and land use. Species richness values were correlated less with watershed size or hydraulic residence time. In each community, there was a group of species characterized by higher correlations with principal component analysis (PCA) axes. These groups are as follows: for phytoplankton--diatoms, for zooplankton--rotifers, and for zoobenthos--molluscs. For lakes both in pristine and developed watersheds, we found small but significant negative species-area correlations for littoral crustaceans. A survey of the relevant literature shows scale dependence for the correlation between species richness and lake size. For pelagic crustaceans, the species-area correlation was significant (and positive) for lakes with developed watersheds but not for pristine watersheds.},

title={Relationship between anti-oxidant capacity and manganese accumulation in the soft tissues of two freshwater molluscs: Unio pictorum mancus (Lamellibranchia, Unionidae) and Viviparus ater (Gastropoda, Prosobranchia)},
abstract={Manganese is an element of great importance in the life cycle of plants and animals. For example, it plays an essential role as an activator of various enzymatic systems such as isoenzymes of superoxide dismutase. Freshwater Unionidae concentrate relatively large amounts of manganese in their tissues, but little is known about the physiological role of this metal. The aim of this research is to acquire a better knowledge of the role of manganese in molluscs which accumulate large amounts of this metal and in those with low manganese concentrations. As manganese is one of the metals present in the superoxide molecule, the possible relationship between manganese concentration in the soft tissues of molluscs and the antioxidant capacity of the metal can usefully be tested. To this end two species of molluscs were analysed: Unio pictorum mancus (Lamellibranchia, Unionidae), which is very rich in manganese, and Viviparus ater (Gastropoda, Prosobranchia) which has a low manganese content. The adults of both species were analysed for manganese concentration by ICP, and for antioxidant capacity as RAC (Relative Antioxidant Capacity) by a superoxide dismutase method. The results clearly demonstrate the active role played by manganese against free radicals and consequently the important role of the metal in protecting Unio against oxidative stress. The low concentration of manganese in Viviparus may be the result of the effective excretion of this metal, as was found for ruthenium.},

title={Roach (Rutilus rutilus) as an important predator on blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) populations in a brackish water environment, the northern Baltic Sea},
abstract={Suspension-feeding bivalves are organisms of major functional importance in several aquatic environments around the world. They are also important food items for many fish and benthivorous seabirds. It has commonly been thought that predation pressure on blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) populations is negligible in the Baltic Sea, owing to the scarcity of major invertebrate predators such as starfish and crabs. It has recently been shown, however, that the blue mussel is the main food item for roach (Rutilus rutilus) in the archipelago areas of the western Gulf of Finland, where this freshwater fish species has become increasingly abundant, mainly due to increased eutrophication. To quantify the influence of roach predation on blue mussel populations we measured the standing biomass and size structure of the local blue mussel population and used a bioenergetic model to estimate mussel consumption by individual roach during two consecutive summers, 1997 and 1998. The results of the model were combined with existing data on roach abundance, giving annual consumption estimates of 75-105 kg blue mussel dry weight ha-1 in the study area, approximately two-thirds of these consumed mussels being >10 mm. This corresponds to approximately one-third of the standing population of mussels >10 mm in the area. Our results suggest that the predation effects of vertebrates on Baltic blue mussel populations are not insignificant, as previously believed. Predation by roach and other predators may have an important structuring effect on unstable blue mussel communities within the Gulf of Finland, where the species lives at the edge of its range.

title={Effects of temperature, salinity, and predators on mortality of and colonization by the invasive hydrozoan Moerisia lyonsi},
abstract={The successful invasion of non-indigeneous species depends on initial colonization as well as establishing a self-maintaining population. The invasive hydrozoan Moerisia lyonsi (Boulenger, 1908), possibly originating from low-salinity waters in the Black Sea and Middle East regions, has become established in low-salinity waters in several estuaries of North America, including Chesapeake Bay. The effects of temperature and salinity on mortality of M. lyonsi polyps were examined in the laboratory in February 2001 in the presence of abundant food. The polyps of M. lyonsi were directly transferred from 20 degrees C and 10 salinity to one of 45 combinations of temperature (10-29 degrees C) and salinity (1-40). Polyp mortality within 7 days occurred only in low-temperature treatments with salinities of 35-40. Surviving polyps reproduced asexually in salinities of 1-40 at 20-29 degrees C, and in salinities of 1-25 at 15 degrees C, but not in any salinities at 10 degrees C. The greatest asexual reproduction rates, an index for population survival potential, occurred at salinities of 5-20. Survival and reproduction of M. lyonsi over such broad temperature and salinity ranges indicate that M. lyonsi may colonize and establish populations throughout the Chesapeake Bay; however, M. lyonsi medusae were reported only at salinities <9.3 there. This discrepancy may be due to the effects of predators. The scyphomedusan Chrysaora quinquecirrha (Desor, 1848), but not the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi (A. Agassiz, 1865) consumed M. lyonsi medusae in laboratory experiments in August-September 2001. Populations of M. lyonsi do not appear to be limited by temperature and salinity conditions; however, their distribution in Chesapeake Bay may be restricted to low salinities not inhabited by predators.

title={The life history responses of the abalone pest, Terebrasabella heterouncinata, under natural and aquaculture conditions},
abstract={The sabellid, Terebrasabella heterouncinata, is a small (<5 mm) intratubular brooder that lives in burrows within the hostrsquos shell matrix. It is a semi-continuous breeder and despite producing small numbers of large eggs, infestation by this animal has reached epidemic proportions on local abalone farms. The present study compared the morphometrics and reproductive characteristics of worms from farmed and wild abalone, in the Walker Bay area of the south Western Cape Province of South Africa, to gain insights into why this animal has become so successful under aquaculture conditions. The farms designated farm A and farm B each had one on-farm site, and two wild sites, while farm C had two on-farm sites and two wild sites. The wild sites were natural abalone habitats located within 2.5 km of the farms. Our results conclusively showed that environmental conditions prevalent on the farms enhanced the reproductive success of these worms relative to that observed in its natural environment. At farms B and C, worms occurred in significantly higher densities at the on-farm sites than in the corresponding wild samples, but at farm A, density was equally low at the three sites. At all three farms, a greater proportion of the population was reproductively active in the on-farm samples than in the wild samples. Worms on farmed abalone had a higher instantaneous fecundity, brooded more clutches simultaneously and were larger than their conspecifics from the wild. There was a positive correlation between adult size and brood size and the number of clutches brooded simultaneously. Within the three on-farm sites there was a negative correlation between egg volume and brood size, indicating a trade-off between these traits. However, such a trade-off was not apparent between sites, with brood size being higher at the on-farm sites than at the wild sites, irrespective of egg size. This suggests that the stable nutrient-enriched environment on the farm led to an increase in fecundity without compromising the size (and implicitly the quality) of the eggs. Worm density did not have a significant effect on body size or any other reproductive traits at most sites, and the density of T. heterouncinata was unaffected by the density of other shell-infesting polychaetes. The results suggest that the farm environment has selected for larger, more fecund worms that breed rapidly with high recruitment success as a consequence of abundant nutrients, high host density, habitat stability and a possible lack of predation and interspecific competition.

Key areas of uncertainty in the assessment of risk include the role of estuarine sediments in mediating the fate and bioavailability of environmental (xeno)oestrogens (notably their transfer to benthic organisms and estuarine food chains), together with evidence for endocrine disruption in invertebrate populations. Emphasis is placed on using published information to interpret the behaviour and effects of a small number of 'model compounds' thought to contribute to oestrogenic effects in nature; namely, the natural steroid 17<ce><b2>-oestradiol (E2) and the synthetic hormone 17<ce><b1>-ethinyloestradiol (EE2), together with the alkylphenols octyl- and nonyl-phenol (OP, NP) as oestrogen mimics. Individual sections of the review are devoted to sources and concentrations of (xeno)oestrogens in waterways, sediment partitioning and persistence, bioaccumulation rates and routes, assays and biomarkers of oestrogenicity, and, finally, a synopsis of reproductive and ecological effects in aquatic species.

abstract={The continental scaup population (Lesser [Aythya affinis] and Greater [A. marila] combined) has declined markedly since 1978. One hypothesis for the population decline states that reproductive success has decreased because female scaup are arriving on breeding areas in poorer body condition than they did historically (i.e. spring condition hypothesis). We tested one aspect of that hypothesis by comparing body mass and nutrient reserves (lipid, protein, and mineral) of Lesser Scaup at four locations (Louisiana, Illinois, Minnesota, and Manitoba) between the 1980s and 2000s. We found that mean body mass and lipid and mineral reserves of females were 80.0, 52.5, and 3.0 g higher, respectively, in the 2000s than in the 1980s in Louisiana; similarly, body mass and lipid and mineral reserves of males were 108.8, 72.5, and 2.5 g higher, respectively. In Illinois, mean body mass and lipid reserves of females were 88.6 and 56.5 g higher, respectively, in the 2000s than in the 1980s; similarly, body mass and lipid and mineral reserves of males were 80.6, 76.0, and 2.7 g higher, respectively. Mean body mass of females were 58.5 and 58.9 g lower in the 2000s than in the 1980s in Minnesota and Manitoba, respectively; mean body mass of males, similarly, were 40.7 g lower in Minnesota. Mean lipid reserves of females in the 2000s were 28.8 and 27.8 g lower than those in the 1980s in Minnesota and Manitoba, respectively. Mean mineral reserves of females in the 2000s were 3.2 g lower than those in the 1980s in Manitoba. Consequently, females arriving to breed in Manitoba in the 2000s had accumulated lipid reserves for 4.1 fewer eggs and mineral reserves for 0.8 fewer eggs than those arriving to breed there in the 1980s. Accordingly, our results are consistent with the spring condition hypothesis and suggest that female body condition has declined, as reflected by decreases in body mass, lipids, and mineral reserves that could cause reductions in reproductive success and ultimately a population decline.

title={To what extent does upright sessile epifauna affect benthic biodiversity and community composition?},
abstract={Small-scale habitat complexity, including that caused by biological structures, is an important factor in structuring benthic communities and also sometimes in increasing biodiversity. The aim of this study was to determine if hydroid colonies have an effect on the composition of benthic communities in the Irish Sea, and if so, which components of the fauna are affected. Forty-six seabed core samples were taken by divers from two sites off Port Erin, Isle of Man, Irish Sea. Half of these were centred on hydroid colonies, half were not. All taxa retained by a 63-microm sieve from the cores were identified and counted. Community composition and diversity were compared between hydroid and non-hydroid cores using multivariate and univariate methods. Benthic communities were significantly different between the two sample groups. This was almost entirely due to the presence of sessile and mobile epifaunal taxa in the hydroid cores. The tube-building amphipod, Ericthonius punctatus, was particularly abundant attached to the hydroid stems. Infauna was not significantly different between the two groups. Upright sessile epifauna may play a particularly important role in the Irish Sea as a settlement substrate for juvenile scallops (Pecten maximus and Aequipecten opercularis), which are an important fishery resource in this area. The 11-year closure of an area to dredging has not only enhanced scallop stocks but has had the added benefit of enhancing habitat complexity and biodiversity. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={BIOCHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF THREE SPECIES OF UNIONID MUSSELS AFTER EMERSION},
abstract={Freshwater mussels are emersed (exposed to air) during conservation activities such as surveys and relocations. Success of these activities depends upon the ability of mussels to survive emersion and to re-burrow in the substratum. We evaluated the acute sublethal effects of emersion on three species of unionid mussels [pocketbook, Lampsilis cardium (Rafinesque, 1820); pimpleback, Quadrula pustulosa pustulosa (I. Lea, 1831); spike, Elliptio dilatata (Rafinesque, 1820)] by measuring three biochemicals (carbohydrate, lipid, protein) indicative of biochemical function and energy storage. Mussels were acclimated in water at 25[degrees]C and exposed to five air temperatures (15, 20, 25, 35 and 45[degrees]C) for 15, 30 and 60 min. After emersion, mussels were returned to water at 25[degrees]C and observed for 14 days. Samples of mantle tissue were taken after the 14-day postexposure period and analysed for carbohydrate, lipid and protein. Three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) did not reveal consistent trends in carbohydrate, lipid or protein concentrations due to sex of mussels, duration of emersion, air temperature or their interaction terms that indicated biological compensation to stress. Overall mean carbohydrate concentrations were greatest (range 447-615 mg/g dry wt) among the species, followed by protein (179-289 mg/g dry wt) and lipids (26.7-38.1 mg/g dry wt). These results have positive implications for conducting conservation activities, because emersion over the range of temperatures (15-35[degrees]C) and durations (15-60 min) examined did not appear acutely harmful to mussels.},

During the first icebreaker cruises into that area, esophagi of collected eiders contained only clams, mostly Nuculana radiata, with no trace of the once-dominant Macoma calcarea. Alternative prey used elsewhere (snails, amphipods, other bivalves) were available but not eaten. Eiders ate mainly N. radiata 18-24<c2><a0>mm long, although M. calcarea of this length contained 62% more energy. Percent body lipid of eiders averaged 12<c2><b1>3% (SD) for 26 adult males and 14<c2><b1>3% for 12 adult females. Mean body mass (<c2><b1>SE) of these males in late March (1,688<c2><b1>21<c2><a0>g) was higher than reported for 53 males after arriving at breeding areas in late May (1,494<c2><b1>14<c2><a0>g).

abstract={Bivalves are important grazers on phytoplankton in shallow waters. However, very little is known about their ability to capture actively moving zooplankton. We investigated the escape response and success of early and late nauplii of three copepod species (Acartia tonsa, Temora longicornis and Eurytemora affinis) in the flow field of a blue mussel, Mytilus edulis, using both video observations and incubation experiments. An empirical model was created to describe the spatial distribution of the fluid deformation rate. Nauplii responded with escape jumps at mean fluid deformation rates of 0.6-1.9 sm1. Escape success differed between taxa. T. longicornis was the poorest escaper, while A. tonsa and E. affinis were more efficient and similar to one another. Deformation rates differed in different parts of the flow field, which resulted in differences in escape success between the sectors. Nauplii were caught most often in the sector furthest away from the exhalent siphon, where the deformation rate was the weakest. There the nauplii were unable to detect an escape signal in time to react and flee. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Recent studies have demonstrated the significant role of colloidal microparticles or macromolecules in the biogeochemical cycling of trace metals in aquatic environments. In this study, the influences of different colloidal organic carbon (COC) concentrations, colloidal sizes and colloidal origins (estuarine vs coastal) on the bioavailability of two trace metals (Cr and Fe) to the green mussel Perna viridis and the clam Ruditapes philippinarum were examined under laboratory conditions. Natural colloids were isolated by cross-flow ultrafiltration and were radiolabeled with 59Fe and 51Cr before being exposed to the mussels and clams. The uptake of colloid-bound Cr and Fe was compared with the uptake of low molecular weight complexed metals (<1 kDa). Both natural colloid-bound Cr and Fe were bioavailable to the green mussels and clams. The uptake of both colloidal Cr and Fe by the two bivalves was much higher than that of their counterparts in a low molecular weight fraction, implying that colloidal binding enhanced considerably the bioavailability of Cr and Fe to the bivalves. The magnitude to which Cr uptake was enhanced, due to its binding with colloids, was much greater than that of Fe. There was no significant difference in the measured dry weight concentration factor of the metals between the two COC concentrations. Similarly, the COC concentration did not influence metal uptake when all the experiments were considered together. There was generally no major difference in the metal bioavailability between the two different sizes of colloids isolated from the coastal waters (1-10 kDa and 10 kDa-0.2 microm), whereas metals bound with the larger size colloids isolated from the estuarine waters were more bioavailable than metals bound with the smaller size colloids. The bioavailability of Cr and Fe bound with the colloids from estuarine waters was generally lower than those bound with colloids from the coastal waters. This study demonstrated that the geochemical properties of colloids (origin) and the chemical properties of metals are critical in affecting the bioavailability of colloid-bound metals to marine bivalves.},

title={Do tributary streams contribute significantly to the transport of faecal pellets in large rivers?},
abstract={Faecal pellets (FPs) produced by suspension feeders, notably larval blackflies (Diptera: Simuliidae), contribute significantly to the conversion and transport of organic matter in northern rivers. In this study we investigated the relative contribution of tributaries to the flux of FPs in a 7^sup th^ order river in northern Sweden. The influx of FPs to the larger river was positively dependent on tributary sub-catchment area, stream order, channel width, proportion of lakes in the sub-catchment, and current velocity. The contribution was <45% of the flux in the large river, but generally it was well below 10% suggesting that the large river transport of FPs is produced within the main channel and not imported from the tributaries, although the latter may significantly support the suspension feeders with food material.

title={The effect of sea urchins as biogenic structures on the local abundance of a temperate reef fish},
abstract={Although widely distributed on rocky reefs at Santa Catalina Island (southern California, USA), the small, substrate-oriented fish, Lythrypnus dalli, often reaches its highest densities in areas of extreme vertical relief where the sea urchin, Centrostephanus coronatus, is common. Through surveys and manipulative field experiments, we examined the extent to which the availability of C. coronatus influenced the distribution and abundance of L. dalli. Adult L. dalli were strongly associated with C. coronatus, but not with two shorter-spined urchins, Strongylocentrotus franciscanus and S. purpuratus. Variation in fish abundance among C. coronatus was affected by three features: the amount of space between the body of the urchin and its rocky shelter, the location of occupied shelters, and urchin size. Field manipulations of C. coronatus density indicated that spatial patterns of L. dalli abundance are causally linked to the presence of urchins. Urchins also had a significant effect on recruitment, migration, and survival of L. dalli. These processes were greatly enhanced where urchins were present. Structural substitutions (models) produced about half the effect of live urchins indicating that biological, as well as structural, attributes of urchins may be important to fish. Our results suggest that habitat selection at the time of settlement, small-scale migration of fish after settlement, and differential survival relative to the presence of sea urchins contribute to the formation and maintenance of the association between L. dalli and C. coronatus. By altering the availability of refuges, sea urchins appear to have a direct and positive effect on the local abundance of this temperate reef fish.},

The responses of zooplankton to increasing biomasses of fish were taxon-dependent. The population growth rates of the most common zooplankton, Diacyclops thomasi, varied inversely with fish biomass, while other crustacean zooplankton showed no significant responses to the fish treatment. The reverse pattern was seen for the rotifer Polyarthra sp. whose population growth rates increased with increasing fish biomass. This is the first in situ evaluation of fish predation on zooplankton in a large river system and demonstrates that predation as well as physical factors may influence riverine zooplankton densities and community structure.},

Traditionally, most LPOs have primarily focused on a relatively narrow ring of land around the shoreline where development is most visible.

abstract={The life-table study on effects of a heavy metal, Cd (100 and 200 mg kg-1 soil), and an insecticide, imidacloprid (4 and 40 g a.i. ha-1), on pea aphids revealed significant effects of both chemicals on life history traits and population dynamics. Substantial differences in the action of the two chemicals and between the two doses of imidacloprid were observed. The pesticide caused high mortality at the beginning of the experiment, however some aphids were able to live for as long as control insects. In contrast, Cd-induced mortality was low at the beginning but increased during the experiment. Analysis of data collected during the first 10 days of the experiment, the first 20 days, or for the whole life-time of the cohort gave different results. While highly significant effects of imidacloprid were detected already after 10 days of the experiment, Cd treatment resulted in no effect for this time of exposure. Higher dose of imidacloprid decreased growth and development rates along with delayed reproduction (9th or 10th day). In contrast, the aphids treated with the low dose of imidacloprid and with both concentrations of Cd started their reproduction at the same day as untreated insects (6th or 7th day), but the reproduction tended to cease earlier. This indicates that too short ecotoxicological tests may result in serious underestimation of some effects, while overestimating others.},

abstract={The recently introduced exotic cladoceran Daphnia lumholtzi offers an excellent opportunity to study the interactions between exotic and native species in invaded communities. Lake surveys in Missouri have indicated a seasonal succession between native Daphnia and D. lumholtzi. In the current study, we examined competition between D. lumholtzi and the native Daphnia parvula by conducting seasonal in situ field experiments in 1.6 l enclosures. Competition was assessed by comparing the rates of increase (r) and birth rates (b) of each species when grown alone versus when grown together in these enclosures. At high densities, D. lumholtzi suppressed D. parvula rates of increase during the late summer and fall experiments, but did not appear to suppress D. parvula birth rates. The rates of increase of D. lumholtzi did not appear to be affected by the presence of D. parvula. The results of these experiments indicate that although competition between the two species occurs seasonally at high densities, the effects are asymmetrical. The lack of competitive effects on D. lumholtzi byD. parvula suggests that factors other than competition are involved in explaining the absence ofD. lumholtzi in spring zooplankton assemblages.},

Thirteen brooding characters (e.g., brooding period, marsupium arrangement, structure of interlamellar septa, etc.) were traced onto this phylogeny. Results indicate that long-term brooding (bradytictia) is the derived state among North American freshwater mussels; short-term brooding (tachytictia) is plesiomorphic. Bradytictia evolved independently in the Anodontinae and Lampsilini, with unique morphological modifications derived in those clades to facilitate long-term brooding.},

The high sequence similarity of the 18S rRNA gene between Argopecten irradians and Argopecten gibbus (98.8%) prevented the design of an A. irradians species-specific probe. Hybridization studies using amplified 18S rDNA from a diverse collection of bivalve species demonstrated that the specificity of the digoxygenin-labeled probe was consistent with the predicted specificity indicated by sequence comparison. Hybridization studies using laboratory-spawned bay scallop veligers indicated that a single veliger could be detected by probe hybridization in a blot format, and that probe hybridization signal was proportional (r^sup 2^= .99) to the abundance of veligers. Methods for rRNA extraction and blotting were developed that allowed bay scallop veligers to be specifically and quantitatively identified in natural plankton samples. Preliminary studies conducted in Tampa Bay, Florida, suggest that introduced scallops can successfully spawn and produce veligers under in situ conditions. The Argopecten-specific probe and methods developed in this study provide the means to study the production and fate of bay scallop larvae in nature and provide evidence that scallops introduced into Tampa Bay have the potential for successful reproduction and enhancement of scallop stocks.},

In a second experiment, Largemouth Bass were infected with glochidia of L. cardium and held at 10[degrees]C. A sample of fishes was removed monthly and brought to 21[degrees]C. Numbers of glochidia that metamorphosed after being warmed were compared to the number that metamorphosed without warming. The percentage that metamorphosed after warming decreased linearly with time. At one month, 100% of the glochidia metamorphosed after warming. This decreased to 80% by two months, to 30% by four months and 3% by six months. Although this post-warming percentage decreased with time, the total percentage of metamorphosed juveniles (at all temperatures) was not correlated with time. Controls kept at 21[degrees]C required three weeks to reach peak metamorphosis, but test subjects subjected to 10[degrees]C required less than nine days to metamorphose once warmed. Many overwintering glochidia therefore complete a portion of their development on the host at winter temperatures, but stop short of excystment. Some glochidia metamorphosed without being warmed, but this phenomenon is not understood. This study confirms that glochidia may overwinter on hosts, with some glochidia persisting for more than six months before metamorphosing when warmer conditions return.},

Mean concentrations of As, Cu, Se and Zn in mussel tissues varied two fold among lakes. Zn, Co and Cd concentrations in mussels were significantly negatively correlated with distance gradients from the origin of the Delta and with distance from main channels of the Danube. Other metal concentrations in mussels did not correlate with either distance gradient.

abstract={To explain summer declines in phytoplankton biomass in large rivers, we compared the effect of zooplankton grazing on the planktonic algae of two large European rivers, the Meuse and the Moselle. In situ grazing was measured during two years (1994 and 1995), using the Haney method. Total zooplankton community filtration rates recorded in the river Meuse ranged between 1 and 32% of the water volume filtered per day. A drastic algal decline was observed early July both years and may be explained by high densities of a rotifer-dominated zooplankton community (500<e2><80><93>700 ind. l-1) with more than 75% of Brachionus calyciflorus. During the summer period in 1994, when grazing was over 20%, edible algal biomass was controlled by a diversified rotifer community (up to 2500 ind. l-1), while a non-edible algal assemblage developed. In contrast, phytoplankton biomass remained comparatively low in the Moselle throughout the low-flow period, as did zooplankton numbers during most of this time (fewer than 200 ind. l-1 during the summer period). The proportion of crustaceans in this zooplankton was rather higher than in the Meuse, and they dominated at times, in biomass as well as in numbers. Nevertheless, measured in situ grazing rates (1<e2><80><93>15%) could not explain the low summer algal biomass, even if low filtration rates may at times represent a significant carbon loss for phytoplankton, when and where net algal production was low. As a conclusion, the role of phytoplankton <e2><80><93> zooplankton interactions in controlling algal biomass in large rivers is discussed.},

title={REVIEW OF PROGRESS UNDER THE STRATEGIC VISION},
abstract={In 1991 the Commission adopted a strategic vision encompassing three areas: healthy ecosystems, integrated management of sea lamprey, and improved institutional/stakeholder partnerships. A review of progress slated for 1995 shows that, although much has been accomplished, achievement of some milestones is behind schedule and achievement of others is difficult to assess because they are either too far reaching or too qualitative. Achievement of the milestones in the vision statement on healthy ecosystems will require a concerted effort by all natural resource agencies with responsibilities for the Great Lakes. An objective of this review is the establishment of a procedural framework for linking water quality and fisheries management on the lakes. Considerable progress has been made in achieving the objectives of the partnership vision statement milestones but accomplishments typically fell short of the target dates. Fish community objectives have been developed for four of the five lakes and research priorities have been identified.},

abstract={A joint research project for the development, testing and implementation of automated biotests, capable of rapidly detecting acutely toxic water conditions of the River Rhine, was carried out by several administrative and scientific institutions in Germany. Automated biomonitors working with the test organisms bacteria, algae, water fleas, mussels, and fishes were tested and compared with respect to their sensitivity, reliability, and practical handling under field conditions. Field trials with atrazine and sodium pentachlorophenolate as toxicants were performed on the River Rhine. Threshold values and LOEC-values (Lowest observed effect concentration) were determined to compare the test specific sensitivity of the test systems. From 1990 to 1992 various biomonitors were tested in monitoring stations on the river Rhine and in a mobile laboratory container on the rivers Rhine and Main. Results of bacteria and algae tests are presented.},

title={Monitoring and Estimating Concentrations and Effects of Microcontaminants in the Rhine-Delta: Chemical Analysis, Biological Laboratory Assays and Field Observations},
abstract={The aim of the Rhine Action Program is to create conditions for the return of (higher) indigenous species. To obtain an impression of current levels of contamination, several separate studies were carried out. The methods applied are discussed briefly and several representative results are given. The focus will be on the integration of the conclusions with respect to the goals of the Program. First, concentrations of traditional microcontaminants in sediment, water and organisms, collected in monitoring programs, are presented. Concentrations of some compounds, such as cadmium, have decreased substantially while concentrations of other compounds, like PCB153, remain on the same level as they were in the late seventies. The current levels will be compared to Dutch quality standards that are thought to protect most of the aquatic community. Secondly, responses in biological assays with Rhine water are presented. In the seventies, laboratory species died immediately after exposure to Rhine water. Nowadays, water has to be concentrated to induce acute mortality. Remarkably, only a few percent of the mortality observed after XAD-concentration can be explained by the organic microcontaminants identified by GC/MS. To cover calamities that are missed by these static assays and by daily chemical analysis, biological early warning systems are positioned along the river. In the past, monitors with the fish species ide (Leuciscus idus) have registered several calamities that were not detected by chemical early warning. Currently monitors with waterfleas (Daphnia magna) are being tested, in order to broaden the spectrum of concentrations and compounds covered. Thirdly, measured data are combined with literature information to obtain an impression of hazards for combinations of chemical compounds and biological taxa. Differences in exposure can be derived from knowledge on habitat and food composition, while information on sensitivity for a chemical can be estimated from data on related taxa. The assessment indicates that most taxa, included target taxa such as Salmonidae, are threatened by current concentrations of different groups of microcontaminants. Finally, some illustrative (semi-)field observations from the Rhine-delta area will be mentioned as a qualitative validation of the extrapolation from experimental and theoretical analysis.},

title={Modeling the Bioaccumulation and Biomagnification Potential of Microplastics in a Cetacean Foodweb of the Northeastern Pacific: A Prospective Tool to Assess the Risk Exposure to Plastic Particles},
abstract={Microplastics (MPs) can readily be ingested by marine organisms. Direct ingestion and trophic transfer are likely to be the main pathway for microplastics to bioaccumulate in upper trophic level organisms. Bioaccumulation potential of MPs in marine mammalian foodwebs is scarcely known. To understand whether microplastics bioaccumulate in marine mammals, a bioaccumulation model for MPs was developed for the filter-feeding humpback whale and fish-eating resident killer whale foodwebs of the Northeastern Pacific. Applying three concentration scenarios for MPs by entering observed water and sediment concentrations as input data (low, high and moderate scenarios), and tested under two different elimination rates (kE) for zooplankton, the model predicted species-specific and foodweb-specific bioaccumulation potential. The predator-prey biomagnification factor (BMFTL, used to assess the ratio of the MP concentration in predator to that in prey adjusted to the difference of trophic levels), involving cetaceans, appeared to be not only lower than one or equal to one (BMFTL <e2><89><a4> 1 as in resident killer whale/Chinook salmon), but also BMFTL > 1 in some predator-prey relationships (humpback whale/zooplankton). Depending on the magnitude of abiotic concentrations used in the modelling, the trophic magnification factor (TMF) regression analyses over time showed lack of evidence for trophic magnification as the magnification was independent of the trophic level, indicating no changes (TMF = 1; p>0.05), and trophic dilution (TMF<1; p<0.05) due to the decrease in MP concentrations as the trophic level increased. Projected biomagnification in simplified foodwebs revealed no significant increase in concentrations as the trophic level increased (TMF=1; p>0.05), following 100-365 days. Compared to the high biomagnification behaviour of persistent organic pollutants in marine foodwebs, scarce biomagnification capacity of microplastic was predicted in the cetacean foodwebs. Notwithstanding, the moderate to high microplastic bioaccumulation predicted in some lower trophic level marine organisms highlights the health risks of toxic exposure to marine fauna and coastal communities relying strongly on seafood. This modelling work provides a tool to assess the bioaccumulation potential and impact of microplastics in the marine environment to support risk assessment and inform plastic waste management.},

abstract={In the present work, the relative effects of the season (early vs. late summer), site (Gulf vs. Pacific study sites), the population of origin (Gulf vs. Pacific) and associated abiotic variables were determined in two geographically-separated Nodipecten subnodosus populations and their reciprocal transplants, through the scope for growth (SFG) and net growth efficiency (K2) using a portable open-flow system. Results indicate that both energy acquisition and expenditure were significantly affected by season, site, and population factors. Scallop energy acquisition and growth efficiency were highest during the earlier, cooler part of the summer and higher at the Pacific site where food availability was highest. Significantly higher respiration rates were measured for the Pacific scallop population, leading to significantly lower net growth efficiency than scallops of Gulf origin, which indicates a physiological advantage for Gulf scallops during the suboptimal growth conditions present during summer months on both coasts of the Baja California peninsula. It may have important implications for aquaculture enterprises in this region, and may also confirm the genetic divergence between these two geographically separated populations. The advantages of the open-flow system for in situ ecophysiological studies in aquatic organisms are discussed.},

abstract={The occurrence of microplastics in the aquatic environment has been reported around the world; however, their effects on freshwater oligochaetes are unknown. In this research, we investigated the toxic effects of polyethylene microplastics (MP), size between 40 and 48<c2><a0><ce><bc>m, on the aquatic worm Allonais inaequalis. We applied the bioassays considering 24<c2><a0><c2><b0>C as standard temperature and thermal stress of 19<c2><a0><c2><b0>C and 29<c2><a0><c2><b0>C, associated with the presence and absence of sediment in short-term and chronic exposures (96<c2><a0>h and 240<c2><a0>h, respectively). MP did not cause significant mortality in short-term exposures and did not affect the reproduction of worms. In addition, when we analyzed whether thermal stress, as well as substrate availability, would have an additional impact on MP toxicity, there were no significant effects. At 29<c2><a0><c2><b0>C, the individuals reached the highest reproduction rates, whereas at 19<c2><a0><c2><b0>C the offspring significantly reduced. Moreover, the lack of sediment substantially reduced survival rates after 96<c2><a0>h under 24<c2><a0><c2><b0>C (p<e2><80><89>=<e2><80><89>0.018). This paper also records for the first time, the ability of microplastic ingestion by a freshwater naidid. Due to its capacity to respond in a short period, adaptation to laboratory cultivation, and representativeness among freshwater aquatic invertebrates, A. inaequalis is presented as a tropical test organism for toxic effect analysis of microplastics, either in conventional exposures or simulated environmental disturbances.},

title={Patterns of mitochondrial and microsatellite DNA markers describe historical and contemporary dynamics of the Humboldt squid <i>Dosidicus gigas</i> in the Eastern Pacific Ocean},
abstract={Dosidicus gigas is an economically important species distributed in the Eastern Pacific Ocean. Unraveling the genetic population structure of this species is crucial to ensure its fishery sustainability and management. Mitochondrial DNA sequences and nuclear neutral loci are useful to understand how historical and contemporary factors drive the genetic population structure of species. However, most studies investigating genetic structuring of D. gigas from its northern and southern populations rely on patterns identified using mitochondrial genes. The use of both types of DNA markers is especially relevant for marine species with high dispersal capabilities such as D. gigas. Here, we describe the genetic structure of D. gigas using partial sequences of the mitochondrial gene NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 and nuclear microsatellite loci in populations of the northern hemisphere from the Costa Rica Thermal Dome and off Ecuador; and, of the southern hemisphere from the South Equatorial Current and off Peru. Statistical parsimony network and Bayesian analyses from mitochondrial sequences revealed three historical maternal lineages in both hemispheres, with high levels of genetic differentiation and signatures of population expansion during the late Pleistocene. Use of Discriminant Analysis of Principal Component (DAPC) with microsatellite loci of mature and immature individuals showed the presence of at least two contemporary genetic stocks homogeneously co-distributed in both northern and southern hemispheres, which can be explained by the biological characteristics of D. gigas and the variable oceanographic conditions of the Eastern Pacific Ocean. Overall, our findings indicate that cooperation between countries with intensive fishing will benefit the sustainability of D. gigas.},

The pressures of food deprivation and competition can lead to a drastic change in previously established strategies of resource acquisition. We conducted a series of trials in which red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) were either deprived of food or satiated and competition was introduced via a plastic model to necessitate the abandonment of established resource acquisition strategies in favor of risk-insensitive strategies. Crayfish exhibited no difference in behavior when exposed to a singular pressure; however, an interaction between food deprivation and competition was detected and indicates that crayfish responded to food sources more quickly and with more risk-insensitive behavior when a model competitor was present. This combination of factors indicates a complex relationship between resource acquisition strategies and the pressures of acquiring food.},

title={Predicting microcystin concentration action-level exceedances resulting from cyanobacterial blooms in selected lake sites in Ohio},
abstract={Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms and the toxins they produce are a global water-quality problem. Monitoring and prediction tools are needed to quickly predict cyanotoxin action-level exceedances in recreational and drinking waters used by the public. To address this need, data were collected at eight locations in Ohio, USA, to identify factors significantly related to observed concentrations of microcystins (a freshwater cyanotoxin) that could be used in two types of site-specific regression models. Real-time models include easily or continuously-measured factors that do not require that a sample be collected; comprehensive models use a combination of discrete sample-based measurements and real-time factors. The study sites included two recreational sites and six water treatment plant sites. Real-time models commonly included variables such as phycocyanin, pH, specific conductance, and streamflow or gage height. Many real-time factors were averages over time periods antecedent to the time the microcystin sample was collected, including water-quality data compiled from continuous monitors. Comprehensive models were useful at some sites with lagged variables for cyanobacterial toxin genes, dissolved nutrients, and (or) nitrogen to phosphorus ratios. Because models can be used for management decisions, important measures of model performance were sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of estimates above or below the microcystin concentration threshold standard or action level. Sensitivity is how well the predictive tool correctly predicts exceedance of a threshold, an important measure for water-resource managers. Sensitivities > 90% at four Lake Erie water treatment plants indicated that models with continuous monitor data were especially promising. The planned next steps are to collect more data to build larger site-specific datasets and validate models before they can be used for management decisions.},

In the present study, dissolved MCs in water, algal cell-bound MCs and muscle tissue MCs of nine fish species were investigated monthly in two of the largest shallow lakes in China: Lake Taihu and Lake Chaohu. The fish species were grouped as carnivorous, planktivorous, and omnivorous fish. Seasonal variations in dissolved and algal cell-bound MCs in water and MCs contents of fish hepatopancreas and muscle were investigated in the two lakes from 2009 to 2010. Dissolved MCs in water ranged from 0.35 to 2.56<e2><80><89><c2><b5>g<e2><80><89>l<e2><88><92>1 in Lake Taihu and 0.16 to 2.45<e2><80><89><c2><b5>g<e2><80><89>l<e2><88><92>1 in Lake Chaohu, and showed seasonally a unimodal distribution. Algal cell-bound MCs also showed a similar seasonal variation in both lakes, but dissolved MCs in water peaked about one month later than algal cell-bound MCs. The MCs content in the Fish muscle was higher MCs from October to December than in the other months. For most of the fish species, it exceeded the tolerable daily intake value established by the WHO. The averaged MCs content in the muscle of carnivorous, planktivorous, omnivorous fish was 48.2, 28.7 and 37.8<e2><80><89><ce><bc>g<e2><80><89>kg<e2><88><92>1 in Lake Taihu, respectively, and 27.8, 18.6 and 20.4<e2><80><89><ce><bc>g<e2><80><89>kg<e2><88><92>1 in Lake Chaohu. It was significantly higher in carnivorous fish than in planktivorous and omnivorous fish, indicating that carnivorous fish has a higher exposure risk to the local people when consuming the harvested fish. The average ratio of hepatopancreas to muscle MCs contents was 13.0, 25.2, 13.8 for carnivorous, planktivorous, omnivorous fishes in Lake Taihu, respectively, and 18.0, 24.9, 14.8 in Lake Chaohu. These ratio for planktivorous fish almost doubled that for carnivorous and omnivorous fish. High correlation of MC content in carnivorous, omnivorous and planktivorous fish indicates that MCs can be delivered along trophic levels in the food chains.},

Advanced analytical methods are thus required to detect pesticides in water. Common pesticide analysis is done by grab sampling of water volumes ranging from milliliters to liters.

Alternatively, passive sampling extracts and collects water directly in situ, thus allowing time for pollutants to be accumulated into the sampler. Passive sampling has recently become a major tool for extraction of organic contaminants in surface water, groundwater and wastewater.

abstract={External loading reduction has been implemented to improve water quality in China since the 2000s. To evaluate the effects of nutrient reduction on phytoplankton, long-term monitoring data for Lake Wuli from 1998 to 2017 were analyzed. After the restoration since 2003, nitrogen decreased significantly from 8 to 2<c2><a0>mg/l until 2008 and then remained stable until 2017, while total phosphorus declined progressively from 0.2<c2><a0>mg/l to approximately 0.08<c2><a0>mg/l during 2003 and 2017. Biological data indicated that phytoplankton biovolume decreased after restoration until 2010 and then increased slightly from 2010 to 2017, mainly due to increasing of cyanobacterial biovolume. The dominant taxa shifted from cryptophyta to cyanobacteria since 2009. The results of both nonmetric multidimensional scaling and random forest regression showed that changes in nutrients, especially decreases in nitrogen, were the main drivers for phytoplankton community variation and increasing of cyanobacterial biovolume to the total phytoplankton biovolume ratio in summer and autumn. In addition to nutrients reduction, climatic variables such as wind speed decrease also played vital roles in increasing of cyanobacterial dominance in Lake Wuli. Our study confirmed that phytoplankton community respond strongly to nitrogen reduction in the subtropics and that climate change mediates the response.},

title={Seasonal Variability in Benthicâ€“Pelagic Coupling: Quantifying Organic Matter Inputs to the Seafloor and Benthic Macrofauna Using a Multi-Marker Approach},
abstract={The exchange between the water column and the seafloor is a complex process, and is particularly intensive in the shallow waters of highly productive coastal areas, where the temporal variability in the inputs of pelagic organic matter will determine many aspects of the benthic community structure. However, few studies have focused on the seasonality of inputs of organic matter to the seafloor, and on the consequent dynamics and time scales of response of benthic consumers. We conducted a one-year study where we repeatedly sampled multiple organic compounds traditionally used as markers to study the link between the pelagic organic matter inputs and the seafloor, and the potential response of benthic macrofauna to seasonal trends in phytoplankton biomass. We simultaneously quantified the particulate organic matter in the water column, the sinking material and different seafloor compartments, and analysed it for pigments, organic carbon and nitrogen content, C/N ratio, and stable isotopes. Seafloor sediment was also analysed for total lipids, and the dominant macrobenthic species for isotopic signatures. Results showed a major deposition of fresh organic matter during the spring bloom followed by more degraded organic matter inputs during the late summer bloom and even lower quality of the organic matter reaching the seafloor during winter. Strong positive relationships between water column and sedimentary pigments suggest that phytoplankton was the main source of carbon to the seafloor. The isotopic signatures of the dominant macrobenthic species suggest a fast response to the organic matter inputs from the water column. However, different species responded differently to the deposition of organic matter. Macoma balthica and Marenzelleria spp. fed on more reworked and degraded sedimentary material, while Monoporeia affinis showed a shift in the feeding habits according to its life stage, with adult individuals feeding on fresher material than juveniles did. Our study highlights the seasonal variability of the benthic-pelagic coupling and the utility of a multi-marker approach to follow the temporal inputs of organic matter from the water column to the seafloor and benthic organisms.},

abstract={Radioisotopes have been used in earth and environmental sciences for over 150 years and provide unique tools to study environmental processes in great detail from a cellular level through to an oceanic basin scale. These nuclear techniques have been employed to understand coastal and marine ecosystems via laboratory and field studies to understand how aquatic organisms respond to environmental stressors including temperature, pH, nutrients, metals, organic anthropogenic compounds and biological toxins. Global marine issues, such as ocean warming, deoxygenation, plastic pollution, ocean acidification, increased duration and intensity of toxic harmful algal blooms (HABs), and coastal contamination are all impacting marine environments, thereby imposing various environmental and economic risks. Being able to reliably assess the health of coastal and marine ecosystems, and how they may respond to future disturbances, can provide vital information for society in the sustainable management of their marine environments. This paper summarises the historical use of radiotracers in these systems, describes how existing techniques of radioecological tracing can be developed for specific current environmental issues and provides information on emerging issues that would benefit from current and new radiotracer methods. Current challenges with using radioecological tracers and opportunities are highlighted as well as opportunities to maximise the uptake of these methods to greatly increase the ability of environmental managers to conduct evidence-based management of coastal and marine ecosystems.},

abstract={While transfer of freshwater cyanobacteria to estuaries has been observed worldwide, the associated transfer of cyanotoxins is less often reported, in particular the sediment contribution. During fall 2018, we monitored the co-occurrence of cyanobacteria and microcystin (MC) in both the water column and in surface sediments at five stations along a river continuum, from a freshwater reservoir to the coastal area in Brittany, France. Cyanobacteria dominated the phytoplankton community in the water column with high densities at the freshwater sites. Microcystis cells and intracellular MC transfer to estuarine and marine sites were observed with decreasing concentrations in accordance with flow dilution. Extracellular MC showed the opposite trend and increased from upstream to downstream in accordance with the lysing of the cells at elevated salinities. Surface sediment samples contained high densities of colonial Microcystis in freshwater and with decreasing concentrations along the salinity gradient, similar to cells concentrations in the water column. Intracellular MC was detected in sediment at all sites except at the marine outlet suggesting the survival of intact cells. Extracellular MC concentrations in sediment were up to five times higher than intracellular concentrations suggesting incomplete MC degradation. mcyB genes were present at all sites, while mcyA genes were absent at the marine outlet suggesting the presence of toxic strains along the estuary. The high densities of intact colonies of potentially toxic Microcystis in the estuarine sediment strongly suggest that sediments can act as an inoculum of cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins in estuaries.},

However, there is a dearth of information about bacterial composition of H. lacustris communities. In current work, we analyze the composition of natural H. lacustris communities from the White Sea coastal temporal rock ponds. For the first time, a 16S rRNA gene-based metagenome of natural H. lacustris bacterial communities has been generated. Main results of its analysis are as follow. Bacterial families Comamonadaceae, Cytophagaceae, Xanthomonadaceae, Acetobacteraceae, Rhodobacteraceae, and Rhodocyclaceae were observed in all studied H. lacustris natural communities. They also contained genera Hydrogenophaga and Cytophaga. Bacteria from the Hydrogenophaga genus were present in H. lacustris cultures after their isolation under the conditions of laboratory cultivation. Similar to other planktonic microalgae, H. lacustris forms a phycosphere around the cells. In this zone, bacteria attached to the algal surface. The contact between H. lacustris and bacteria is maintained even after sample drying. The study provides information about possible members of H. lacustris core microbiome, which can be presented in the industrial and laboratory cultures of the microalga.},

At the undamaged Mongsanpo Beach, all the biometric components (dry tissue weights and biochemical components) remained at low levels during autumn<e2><80><93>winter but increased rapidly through spring, followed by a dramatic drop in August. In contrast, at the oil-damaged beach, no clear seasonal fluctuations were detected in the biometric components during the study period. Absolute values of all the components were much higher at the control than at the damaged site. This lack of energy reserves in the clams in the damaged area likely resulted in a failure of gametogenic development. Gonadal maturity index peaked in summer at both beaches. However, the gross egg weight was much higher at the control than at the damaged site during June<e2><80><93>July. In addition, its different peak timing between sites indicated a month<e2><80><99>s lag in the major spawning pulse at the oil-damaged beach. The spatial variations in all the biometric components of the clams observed in this study clearly implied that the Hebei Spirit oil spill may interfere with the clam phenology at Malipo Beach within 2 to 3<c2><a0>years after the incident.},

abstract={Perfluorooctanoic acid<e2><80><99>s (PFOA) widespread use, presence and persistence in the aquatic environment has led to an increasing number of studies focusing on its toxicological effects. In Australia, PFOA has been detected in the aquatic environment, however its effects on Australian native fauna are unknown. In this study, male Australian native fish Murray River rainbowfish (Melanotaenia fluviatilis) were exposed to four different concentrations of PFOA (0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10<e2><80><89>mg<e2><80><89>L<e2><88><92>1). Variations in thyroid hormones (Triiodothyronine (T3)/Thyroxine (T4)) and the presence of vitellogenin were determined in plasma. Oxidative stress responses were evaluated in gills and liver. Exposure of male fish to PFOA resulted in altered T3/T4 ratios and the presence of vitellogenin in the plasma. Activities of catalase (CAT) and glutathione- S-transferase (GST) were significantly increased in the gills and significantly reduced in the liver. Lipid peroxidation was observed in both tissues showing that vital organs could not neutralize the peroxides generated by oxidative stress resulting from exposure to PFOA. In natural populations exposed to PFOA, such hormonal disturbances can have negative effects, notably through altered capacity to respond to changes in environmental conditions.},

title={ASSESSING THE ALLOCHTHONOUS AND AUTOCHTHONOUS SEDIMENT INPUTS IN CONJUNCTION WITH CATCHMENT AND IN SITU DEPOSITIONAL CONDITIONS IN SEVERAL SHALLOW LAKES OF THE DANUBE DELTA AND THE BLACK SEA LITTORAL AREA},
abstract={In order to assess the origin and contribution of the autochthonous and allochthonous material to the recent natural sedimentation, analyses of the main lithological components, i.e., total organic matter (TOM%), total carbonates (CAR%) and minerogenic fraction (SIL%), were performed on several bottom sediment samples, gathered from five lakes. These lakes represent different environmental situations (i.e., deltaic, lagoon and littoral/coastal environment), but they are all influenced by the river/rivulet input of water and sediments. Sampling techniques take into consideration an undisturbed substratum (0 - 30 cm) from surface and subsurface bottom sediment samples, that were collected, using Van Veen Grab Sampler, from 141 stations, along the selected longitudinal and latitudinal transects of the lakes. Loss On Drying and, respectively, Loss On Ignition Methods were used to estimate the percentage contents ofTOM%, CAR% and SIL%. The main physical processes that influence the sediment deposition within these lakes are generally related to hydrodynamics and sediment transport, climatic conditions, and environmental variables within the depositional areas. The results reveal a similar alternating lithology between organic-rich sediments (low energy environmental conditions), mineral-rich sediments (higher energy environmental conditions) and "transitional"/mixed sediments (mixed sediment environments). In complex environments, like the study area, with both fluvial input and high in situ productivity, separating and quantifying the two constituents is not straight forward. Further investigations are required to corroborate the findings of this paper for recent sediment accumulations in environments with mixed sedimentary processes.},

abstract={Crime prediction using machine learning and data fusion assimilation has become a hot topic. Most of the models rely on historical crime data and related environment variables. The activity of potential offenders affects the crime patterns, but the data with fine resolution have not been applied in the crime prediction. The goal of this study is to test the effect of the activity of potential offenders in the crime prediction by combining this data in the prediction models and assessing the prediction accuracies. This study uses the movement data of past offenders collected in routine police stop-and-question operations to infer the movement of future offenders. The offender movement data compensates historical crime data in a Spatio-Temporal Cokriging (ST-Cokriging) model for crime prediction. The models are implemented for weekly, biweekly, and quad-weekly prediction in the XT police district of ZG city, China. Results with the incorporation of the offender movement data are consistently better than those without it. The improvement is most pronounced for the weekly model, followed by the biweekly model, and the quad-weekly model. In sum, the addition of offender movement data enhances crime prediction, especially for short periods.},

title={Assessment of Water Quality Using Chemometrics and Multivariate Statistics: A Case Study in Chaobai River Replenished by Reclaimed Water, North China},
abstract={Dry rivers could be effectively recovered by reclaimed water in North China, while river water quality would be an important issue. Therefore, it is important to understand the spatiotemporal variation and controlling factors of river water. Water samples were collected during March, May, July, September, and November in the year 2010, then 20 parameters were analyzed. The water environment was oxidizing and alkaline, which was beneficial for nitrification. Nitrate was the main nitrogen form. Depleted and enriched isotopes were found in reclaimed water and river water, respectively. Total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) of reclaimed water exceed the threshold of reclaimed water reuse standard and Class V in the surface water quality criteria. Most river water was at the severe eutrophication level. The sodium adsorption ratio indicated a medium harmful level for irrigation purpose. Significant spatial and temporal variation was explored by cluster analysis. Five months and nine stations were both classified into two distinct clusters. It was found that 6 parameters (chloride: Cl<e2><88><92>, sulphate: SO42<e2><88><92>, potassium: K+, sodium: Na+, magnesium: Mg2+, and total dissolved solids: TDS) had significant upward temporal variation, and 12 parameters (dissolved oxygen: DO, electric conductivity: EC, bicarbonate: HCO3<e2><88><92>, K+, Na+, Ca2+, TDS, nitrite-nitrogen: NO2-N, nitrate nitrogen: NO3-N, TN, TP, and chlorophyll a: Chl.a) and 4 parameters (Mg2+, ammonia nitrogen: NH3-N, and the oxygen-18 and hydron-2 stable isotope: <ce><b4>18O and <ce><b4>2H) had a significant downward and upward spatial trend, respectively. The Gibbs plot showed that river water chemistry was mainly controlled by a water<e2><80><93>rock interaction. The ionic relationship and principal component analysis showed that river water had undergone the dissolution of carbonate, calcite, and silicate minerals, cation exchange, a process of nitrification, photosynthesis of phytoplankton, and stable isotope enrichment. In addition, gypsum and salt rock have a potential dissolution process.},

abstract={The aim of the present research was to investigate the bioaccumulation of thallium (Tl), a technology-critical element, in fish intestine and muscle, gammarids and the fish intestinal parasites, acanthocephalans, and to evaluate their potential as indicators of metal exposure in aquatic environments. Moreover, total and cytosolic (metabolically available and potentially toxic fraction) Tl concentrations were measured and compared between the intestines of brown trout (Salmo trutta Linnaeus, 1758) from the karst Krka River and Prussian carp (Carassius gibelio Bloch, 1782) from the lowland Ilova River. Since there is a scarcity of information on subcellular metal partitioning in the fish intestine, the results of Tl concentrations in acid digested intestinal tissue, homogenate and cytosol represent preliminary data on Tl diet-borne uptake in salmonid and cyprinid fish. In both rivers, samplings were performed upstream (reference site) and downstream (contaminated site) of the wastewater impact in autumn and spring. Total Tl concentrations were much higher in brown trout than Prussian carp, and higher proportions of cytosolic Tl concentrations were observed in the intestinal tissue of brown trout (45<e2><80><93>71<e2><80><89>%) compared with that of Prussian carp (32<e2><80><93>47<e2><80><89>%). Therefore, both indicators showed species- and site-specific differences. Considering different bioindicator organisms, the most effective Tl accumulation was evident in acanthocephalans compared with the fish tissues and gammarids, which confirmed the potential of fish parasites as bioindicators of metal exposure. Trends of spatial and temporal Tl variability were mostly comparable in all indicator organisms and for total and cytosolic Tl concentrations in the intestine of salmonid and cyprinid fish species, which confirmed their application as useful biological tools in metal exposure assessment.},

abstract={The global demand for dietary proteins and protein-derived products are projected to dramatically increase which cannot be met using traditional protein sources. Seafood processing by-products (SPBs) and microalgae are promising resources that can fill the demand gap for proteins and protein derivatives. Globally, 32 million tonnes of SPBs are estimated to be produced annually which represents an inexpensive resource for protein recovery while technical advantages in microalgal biomass production would yield secure protein supplies with minimal competition for arable land and freshwater resources. Moreover, these biomaterials are a rich source of proteins with high nutritional quality while protein hydrolysates and biopeptides derived from these marine proteins possess several useful bioactivities for commercial applications in multiple industries. Efficient utilisation of these marine biomaterials for protein recovery would not only supplement global demand and save natural bioresources but would also successfully address the financial and environmental burdens of biowaste, paving the way for greener production and a circular economy. This comprehensive review analyses the potential of using SPBs and microalgae for protein recovery and production critically assessing the feasibility of current and emerging technologies used for the process development. Nutritional quality, functionalities, and bioactivities of the extracted proteins and derived products together with their potential applications for commercial product development are also systematically summarised and discussed.},

title={Cadmium Pollution in the Tourism Environment: A Literature Review},
abstract={Cadmium is a highly-toxic metal, and, its environmental occurrence and human exposure consequently deserve close attention. The insight into the relationships between cadmium and tourism relations has deepened during the past three decades and the research into this relationship is reviewed. For this purpose, 83 relevant publications (mainly articles in international journals) were analyzed. It was found that investigation of Cd in the tourism environment took place in all continents (except Antarctica) and has intensified since the mid-2000s; Chinese researchers are the most active contributors. The Cd occurrence in air, living organisms, sediments, soil, suspended particular matter, water, and of the human environment has been studied. It has become clear that tourism contributes to Cd pollution (particularly, by hotel wastewater and increased traffic), and, vice versa, Cd pollution of beaches, coastal waters, food, urban parks, etc. creates risks for tourists and increases human exposure to this toxic metal. Both mechanisms have received equal attention. Examples concern many places worldwide, with the Mediterranean and Central and Eastern Europe as apparently critical regions. Our significantly incomplete knowledge of the relationships between cadmium and tourism must be ascribed to the common oversimplification of these relationships and to the scarcity or even absence of information supplied by the most important tourist destinations. The present review demonstrates that more studies of heavy metals and, particularly, Cd in the tourism environment are needed.},

abstract={There was studied the effect of two feed additives made from finely ground wastes of the primary processing of marine aquatic organisms on the biochemical parameters of the protein metabolism of the blood serum of broiler chickens of Ross 308 cross. The composition of the mineral feed additive (MFA) included mussel leaves and seawater, the protein-mineral feed additive (PMFA) - the leaves of large and the body of small mussels, seaweed Phyllophora nervosa and seawater. The determination of blood serum indices was performed using an automatic biochemical analyzer GBG ChemWell2910 (USA) and the use of test systems Global Scientific (USA). According to the results of biochemical studies of the broiler chickens' blood serum, the diet of which was supplemented with feed additives, there was established an increase in the total protein content, incl. albumin and globulin. Compared with MFA, the use of PMFA to a greater extent increased the content of total protein, albumin, and globulin. The total protein content changes and its fractions occurred due to an increase in the activity of transamination enzymes: alanine and aspartate aminotransferase and the absence of changes in glucose content. Due to the relatively smaller increase in the amount of albumin compared to globulin, the albumin-globulin ratio in the chickens of the experimental groups was lower. Among the globulin fractions, the greatest changes were observed in the relative content of <c3><a1>2 -globulins. Based on the results of the research, a conclusion was drawn on the stimulating effect of feed additives of marine aquatic organisms on the protein metabolism condition of broiler chickens.},

abstract={Many studies have been concentrated on the distribution of algae in lakes, rivers, and seas, however, few studies have been concerned about their distribution and relation with polluted urban rivers. In this study, the spatio-temporal variation characteristics of water quality and algae community in Nanjing city were investigated with microscopic examination for one year. Results showed that the water pollution in this area was mainly related to high concentration of nitrogen (NH3-N and TN (Total nitrogen). There was a total of 77 species of algae in the studied rivers from June 2016 to May 2017, among which 73 species of planktic algae and 34 species of epipelic algae, in which the abundance and biomass of the latter were 1925 and 904 times that of the former, respectively. The two kinds of algae had different change tendencies which were related to seasons. For planktic algae, the abundance and biomass decreased in this season sequence: summer, spring, autumn, and winter. For epipelic algae, the abundance and biomass were relatively higher in winter. The dominant community of planktic algae was Chlorophyta-Bacillariophyceae-Cyanobacteria type, while that of epipelic algae was Bacillariophyceae<e2><80><94>Cyanobacteria type. Most of the present algae were bi-trophic species, and were tightly related to the pollution characteristics of the rivers. The key environmental factors for planktic algae are T, TN, and TP, and those for Epipelic algae are N:P and TN. The relation between the community composition of planktic and epipelic algae and environmental parameters are highly complex, and it is worth carrying out further study to clarify their interaction mechanism.},

We have investigated the possible biotransfer of BMAA from mussels, via mussel-based feed, into chickens. Chickens were divided into two groups, the control and the treatment. BMAA was extracted from the muscle, liver, brain, and eye tissues in both chicken groups; a UPLC-MS/MS method was subsequently used to quantify BMAA. The results indicate detectable concentrations of BMAA in both chicken groups. However, the BMAA concentration in chicken was 5.65 times higher in the treatment group than the control group, with the highest concentration found in muscle tissue extracted from the treatment group chickens. These data suggest that there is a BMAA transfer route within the agro-aqua cycle, so further investigation is recommended before using mussel-based feed in the chicken industry.},

abstract={Although the cyanobacterium Microcystis is colonial during water blooms, isolated Microcystis strains become unicellular in culture. Studies indicate that heterotrophic bacteria can promote Microcystis colonies in culture, but little is known about the underlying mechanism or how widespread it is among bacteria. This study investigated the identity and colony-promoting effects of bacteria isolated from the 2014 Microcystis bloom in Lake Erie. Isolates were classified by their 16S rRNA gene sequences. Toxic and non-toxic cultures of M. aeruginosa were exposed to exudates of bacterial isolates, and their morphology, polysaccharide content, and reflectance spectra were compared to those of M. aeruginosa control cultures. Six isolates belonging to three genera enhanced the frequency or size of M. aeruginosa colonies in cultures where a dialysis barrier prevented direct contact between heterotrophic cells and M. aeruginosa cells. Toxic and non-toxic M. aeruginosa strains differed in how their morphology and optical properties responded to treatment. This study demonstrates that heterotrophic bacteria can promote colonial morphology in Microcystis without making physical contact with the Microcystis cells, as well as the first to indicate that toxic and non-toxic strains of the same morphospecies have different morphological and optical responses.},

Here, using an identification assisted by molecular markers, we report the Digenea species parasitizing the most abundant limpet species inhabiting ice-free rocky intertidal and subtidal zones of the Southern Ocean, viz. Nacella concinna from the Antarctic and Nacella deaurata from the Magellan region. The limpets harbored larval Digenea (two metacercariae and one sporocyst).

Moreover, there are no studies on the heavy metals<e2><80><99> concentrations in the straightfin barb (Enteromius paludinosus, Peters 1852), a fish species that hosts a parasite (Ligula intestinalis), the latter having been reported to have a high ability to absorb heavy metals from its host. This paper therefore addresses the accumulation of heavy metals, namely arsenic (As), chromium (Cr), lead (Pb), and mercury (Hg) in the tissues of straightfin barb, Enteromius paludinosus (Peters 1852) from the mouth of River Malewa in Lake Naivasha, Kenya. A total of 1307 fish were collected during the month of November 2017. Water samples, sediment samples, 25 fish muscle tissues, and its endoparasite, the cestode Ligula intestinalis, were isolated, and heavy metal concentrations were determined using the thermal-electron atomic absorption spectrophotometer at the Lake Nakuru Water Quality Testing Laboratory. The concentrations of heavy metals in the sediment were below the lowest effect level in sediment, threshold effect concentration in sediment, severe effect concentration in sediment, and the shale values of sedimentary rocks thus showing no sign of pollution. In the muscle tissues of the fish, As, Cr, Pb, and Hg showed high levels with mean concentrations of 5.0696, 22.0854, 45.2108, and 1.5458<c2><a0>mg/kg ww, respectively. Bioconcentration factors further supported the observation that trace element accumulation was higher in fish compared with sediment and water. The target hazard quotients of As, Cr, Pb, and Hg obtained for both the female and male were ><e2><80><89>1 indicating a possible health risk associated with the consumption of E. paludinosus. The bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) for L. intestinalis were 2.4093, 2.1873, 5.8601, and 5.1395 for As, Cr, Pb, and Hg, respectively, indicating the potential of the cestode in the accumulation of heavy metals from the host; hence, it can be used as an accumulation bioindicator.},

title={Composition and settling properties of suspended particulate matter in estuaries of the Chesapeake Bay and Baltic Sea regions},
abstract={PurposeOur goal was to understand how differences in source material (allochthonous vs. autochthonous) and phytoplankton communities (diatoms vs. cyanobacteria) influence composition and settling properties of suspended particulate matter.Materials and methodsWe characterized the composition and settling properties of suspended particulate matter in two systems<e2><80><94>one which has a high hydrologic loading factor (watershed to surface area ratio), and a diatom-dominated phytoplankton community (James River Estuary, USA), and a second, where hydrologic inputs are proportionally smaller, and the summer phytoplankton community is<c2><a0> dominated by cyanobacteria (Curonian Lagoon, Lithuania).Results and discussionIn the James, we found that TSS concentrations were positively related to discharge, whereas POC concentrations were negatively correlated with discharge and positively correlated with Chl-a. We infer that suspended particulate matter in this system was largely derived from allochthonous inputs, but that the organic matter fraction was derived from autochthonous production. In the Curonian Lagoon, TSS concentrations were correlated with Chl-a, but not discharge, indicating that suspended particulate matter was largely of autochthonous origin. In the James, the proportion of settleable materials was greater during high TSS concentrations, indicating that high discharge events delivered heavier particulates. In the Curonian Lagoon, we observed a seasonal decline in settling rates associated with the shift from mixed (diatoms and chlorophytes) to cyanobacteria-dominated phytoplankton, which we attribute to the presence of positively buoyant cyanobacteria.ConclusionsWe found that a comparative approach yielded useful insights regarding sources, composition, and settling properties of suspended particulate matter in two estuaries that differ in hydrologic loading and phytoplankton community composition. Our findings suggest that the presence of positively buoyant cyanobacteria favors export losses of particulate C, N, and P to marine waters over retention through sedimentation in transitional zones.},

title={Oyster (Crassostrea gasar) gastrointestinal tract microbiota and immunological responses after antibiotic administration},
abstract={Microbiota, the microorganisms that colonize living organisms. Oysters rely exclusively on an innate immune system. This study characterized the cultivable gastrointestinal tract microbiota (GTM) of the oyster Crassostrea gasar and evaluated their influence on immune responses. Antibiotics were used to reduce or alter the microbiota during in vitro and in vivo assays. Haemocyte viability, concentration, and phagocytic capacity, as well as the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), were evaluated in antibiotic-treated and control oysters. Microbiological analysis of the gastrointestinal tract was also performed; bacteria were selected using culture media and were identified by 16S ribosomal DNA. The results showed that the antibiotics eliminated bacteria in vitro but increased their concentrations in vivo. The GTM was composed of 26% amylolytic bacteria, 21% lipolytic bacteria, 18% proteolytic bacteria, 18% cellulolytic bacteria and 17% lactic acid bacteria; there were no differences in the amounts of these bacterial types between the control and treated oysters. Three major bacterial phyla, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, and seven genera, Labrenzia, Pseudomonas, Halomonas, Shewanella, Vibrio, Bacillus, and Micrococcus, were detected. The concentration, viability, and phagocytic capacity of hemocytes and the production of ROS were not significantly altered by antibiotic treatment. In conclusion, the antibiotics altered the number of heterotrophic bacteria without changing hemocyte function, suggesting that this assay could be useful for verifying the influence of microbiota in host-parasite interactions.},

title={Contribution of trace metallic elements to weakly contaminated lacustrine sediments: effects on benthic and pelagic organisms through multi-species laboratory bioassays},
abstract={Surficial sediments exhibit higher levels of contamination than overlying water, especially from persistent contaminants such as trace metallic elements (TMEs). While sediments could in turn act as sources of contamination for the water column, their ecotoxicology is yet rarely assessed in a multi-compartments perspective. This study aims at assessing the response of benthic and pelagic organisms exposed to weakly contaminated sediments using a multi-species laboratory assay by focusing on TMEs (Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn) contamination. Chironomus riparius larvae, Daphnia magna, and Lemna minor were simultaneously exposed for 10 days to six sediments sampled from the littoral of a large French lake (Lake Bourget). The endpoints consisted in the survival and growth rates and the bioconcentration factor (BCF). Significant negative relationships between sediment TME concentrations and survival rates of C. riparius and growth rates of C. riparius and D. magna suggested that both benthic and pelagic macro-invertebrates were impacted by sediment contamination, which was not observed in L. minor. Significant relationships of the sediment with the internal TME concentrations were positive while negative with the BCFs, suggesting an increase in biological regulation processes in all organisms with the increase of sediment TME concentrations. These results underline the importance of including both benthic and pelagic organisms in ecotoxicological assessment of low contaminated sediments and the relevance of the relationship BCFs/sediment contamination as prior biomarkers than higher life history traits.},

title={Mating under the influence: male Siamese fighting fish prefer EE2-exposed females},
abstract={Countless pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) exist on the market with more added each day. Many of these compounds are not removed during the wastewater treatment process and enter bodies of water in their active form. EDCs are known to have physiological and behavioral effects in exposed organisms. Exposure to the synthetic estrogen 17<ce><b1>-ethinylestradiol (EE2), a common EDC found in birth control pills, has been found to lead to population collapse after only a few generations in some fish species. Mechanisms identified as potential driving forces for collapse include feminization of males and altered fecundity in both sexes. However, an additional way in which EE2 could lead to population collapse is by altering courtship behavior, which could then change mating preferences and decrease mating opportunities. The current study had the following objectives: determine if exposing female Siamese fighting fish, Betta splendens, to EE2 changes mate choice in males; assess if the dose and duration of female exposure matters; and examine if exposing males to EE2 influences their mating preferences. Both unexposed and exposed males were presented with pairs of females that differed in EE2 dose and exposure duration. The results indicate that males were more responsive to EE2-exposed females than unexposed females, with males being most responsive to females exposed to the low versus high dose. Furthermore, exposed males responded less overall than unexposed males. If EE2 concentration increases in the environment, the likelihood of successful mating could decrease and, therefore, potentially lead to adverse population impacts.},

abstract={This study was an attempt to understand the factors influencing the heavy metal distribution in polluted fluvial system sediments. Various biogeochemical processes<c2><a0>and anthropogenic factors were playing an important role in altering the concentration of heavy metals in the sediments. This paper has two objectives: The first one is to investigate the effect of the variation in the physicochemical conditions on the speciation of trace elements trapped in the sediments of the Sebou River. The second one is to study the kinetics mobilization of these heavy metals. Batch resuspension experiments were conducted in order to investigate the release of heavy metals from a polluted anoxic sediment submitted to different physicochemical conditions variations. It has been revealed that in oxygenated environment, sediments were oxidized which cause the release of some heavy metals, but their concentrations, as dissolved phase, were sustained constant or were increased with time. However, in acidic and anaerobic environment, most of the metallic trace elements were released together with the iron and the manganese, but some of these elements like chromium were precipitated. However, some of other elements were maintained in solution, which represents a real human health risk.},

title={Age- and sex-dependent variation in the activity of antioxidant enzymes in the brown trout (<i>Salmo trutta</i>)},
abstract={Oxidative stress is defined as the imbalance between pro-oxidant and antioxidant molecules in favor of the former and it represents one of the main driving forces of aging. To counteract the harmful effects of oxidative stress, organisms evolved a complex antioxidant system. According to the free radical theory of aging, while the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) increases with age, the antioxidant defenses decline. Although this relationship has been investigated in diverse vertebrate taxa, the information in fish is scant and inconsistent, particularly for wild populations. Thus, the aim of the present study was the investigation of age- and sex-related changes of the antioxidant enzymes activity in free-living individuals of the brown trout (Salmo trutta). We measured the activity of the main enzymes involved in antioxidant protection, namely superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione S-transferase (GST), as well as lipid peroxidation, in the gills and the liver dissected from brown trout (1+- to 5+-year-old). A significant age-dependent variation in the activity of antioxidant enzymes was noted, with the exception of CAT. GPx activity followed a significant increasing trend with age in both the organs, while SOD decreased in the liver. Increased GST activity was found in the gills only. Lipid peroxidation levels significantly decreased with age in both the organs. SOD and CAT showed sex-dependent differences in the liver of brown trout, with males showing lower enzymatic activity than females. Our data contribute to improve the knowledge on the relationship between antioxidant enzyme activity, aging, and sex in fish.},

title={Management Transition to the Great Lakes Nearshore: Insights from Hydrodynamic Modeling},
abstract={The emerging shift in Great Lakes management from offshore to nearshore waters will require attention to complexities of coastal hydrodynamics and biogeochemical transformations. Emphasizing hydrodynamics, this work resolves transport processes in quantifying discharge plume and pollutant of concern (POC) footprint dimensions, the latter being the portion of the plume where water quality standards are not met. A generic approach, isolated from pollutant-specific biokinetics, provides first-approximation estimates of the footprint area. A high-resolution, linked hydrodynamic-tracer model is applied at a site in the Greater Toronto Area on Lake Ontario. Model results agree with observed meteorological and hydrodynamic conditions and satisfactorily simulate plume dimensions. Footprints are examined in the context of guidelines for regulatory mixing zone size and attendant loss of beneficial use. We demonstrate that the ratio of the water quality standard to the POC concentration at discharge is a key determinant of footprint dimensions. Footprint size for traditional pollutants (ammonia, total phosphorus) meets regulatory guidelines; however, that for soluble reactive phosphorus, a presently unattended pollutant, is ~1<e2><80><93>2 orders of magnitude larger. This suggests that it may be necessary to upgrade treatment technologies to maintain consistency with regulatory guidelines and mitigate manifestations of the eutrophication-related soluble reactive phosphorus POC.},

title={Water column nutrient processing rates in rivermouths of Green Bay (Lake Michigan)},
abstract={Understanding the quantity and form of nutrient loads to large lakes is necessary to understand controls over primary production, phytoplankton community composition and the production of phytotoxins. Nutrient loading estimates to large lakes are primarily made at stream gages that are deliberately placed outside the direct influence of lake processes, but these estimates cannot take into account processes that occur in the biologically active river-to-lake transition zone. These transition zones (rivermouths) sometimes alter nutrient concentrations and ratios substantially, but few studies have directly measured processing rates of nutrients within rivermouths. From April through September 2016, we conducted 23 water column incubation experiments to measure nutrient loss rates in four rivermouths. First order loss rates (K) for inorganic nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) indicated greater loss in light than in dark treatments, suggesting primary production increases N and P removal. Variability in K was high across both time and space, and the measured environmental parameters did not appear to be strongly associated with this variation in K for most N and P forms. If the measured K values and water residence times are accurate, then between 0 and 99% of the inorganic P and nitrates entering the rivermouth would be lost (i.e., converted to organic or particulate P). In late summer, Fox River discharge is low and residence times are usually long, which allow for much higher proportional nutrient removal in the water column. Water column processing appears to be capable of transforming large quantities of dissolved N and P to particulate forms and thus altering its transport and presumably its bioavailability.},

abstract={Previous studies have demonstrated the modulation of glutathione transferases (GSTs) induced by microcystin (MC) alone or in combination with other cyanobacterial secondary metabolites in bivalves. However, interspecies information about which and how GST isoforms are affected by these secondary metabolites is still scarce, especially considering the dynamic process involving their uptake and elimination routes. In this context, the role of GSTs gene expression changes in response to a toxic Microcystis aeruginosa extract were examined for Mytilus galloprovincialis and Ruditapes philippinarum during exposure and recovery phases. The expression levels of sigma 1, sigma 2, pi and mu-class GST genes were analyzed in the hepatopancreas of both bivalve species during cyanobacteria extract exposure (24<e2><80><89>h) and post-exposure (24 and 72<e2><80><89>h). Only a significant induction of sigma 1-class GST expression was observed for R. philippinarum upon 24-hour exposure of both bivalve species to Microcystis extract. During the recovery phase, GST transcriptional changes for M. galloprovincialis were characterized by an early induction (24<e2><80><89>h) of sigma 1 and sigma 2 transcripts. On the other hand, GST transcriptional changes for R. philippinarum during post-exposure phase were characterized by an early induction (24<e2><80><89>h) of sigma 1 and mu transcripts and a later induction (72<e2><80><89>h) of the four analyzed GST transcripts. Such differences reflect variable GST response mechanisms to cope with MC-producing cyanobacterial blooms exposure between these two bivalve species, revealing a higher sensitivity of R. philippinarum to Microcystis-induced stress than M. galloprovincialis. The results also suggest a much higher level of activity of the GST detoxification system during the recovery phase compared to the period of the stress exposure for both bivalve species.},

Its application in some area of technological and mechanical advancement was also considered. The process of its synthesis and characterization was also put into consideration. Metal-organic frameworks can be said to be an exciting new class of nanoporous crystalline materials containing a metal as its central ion surrounded by organic ligands. An overwhelming characteristic of MOFs lies in its surface area which is amazingly large, exceeding those of known best activated carbons and zeolites. There is an increasingly high demand in the application of MOFs for a multitude of environmental uses or application to be used for capturing and separating various unwanted or even environmentally harmful chemicals, elements or materials. The advantage of MOFs over other known adsorbent materials, such as zeolites and carbon black, is that it possesses a far greater surface area along with amazingly great pore properties. In this review the synthesis and characterization of MOFs, the fate of heavy metals, the application of MOFs in heavy metals remediation and other means of heavy metals remediation are well discussed.},

abstract={The characterization of temporal and spatial patterns in phosphorus (P) loading in Lake Erie is essential in order to continue monitoring the excessive P condition that comes from the western Lake Erie Basin. This study aims to perform such a characterization using the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) methods. These wavelet transformations were conducted on streamflow data, TP loads, and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) of six stations located near Lake Erie of Northern Ohio. These stations are located near the outlet of Cuyahoga, Grand, Maumee, Vermilion, Raisin, and Sandusky watersheds. Long-term continuous P loading data, in which some dated back to 1970, were used in the analysis. The results obtained from the CWT and DWT approaches were found to complement each other. Streamflow had significant mixed variability at 1, 2, and 4 years. The variability for SRP was limited to 1 and 2 years while the TP variability was only seen at the 1-year scale. It was interesting to find that strong temporal patterns of SRP were observed in most of the watersheds only after the mid-1990s. The CWT wavelet spectra also reflected the land use characteristics of each watershed. For example, the wavelet spectra of surface runoff and TP for the agricultural watersheds (i.e., Raisin, Sandusky, and Maumee Rivers) were similar and characterized by significant variability primarily at the annual scale and at the two to four-year periodicities. The urbanized watershed (i.e., Cuyahoga River) did not show any association between either phosphorus (TP or SRP) with surface runoff and baseflow, which indicates that P in the urbanized watershed was not driven by the flow.},

title={Handling times and saturating transmission functions in a snailâ€“worm symbiosis},
abstract={All dynamic species interaction models contain an assumption that describes how contact rates scale with population density. Choosing an appropriate contact<e2><80><93>density function is important, because different functions have different implications for population dynamics and stability. However, this choice can be challenging, because there are many possible functions, and most are phenomenological and thus difficult to relate to underlying ecological processes. Using one such phenomenological function, we described a nonlinear relationship between field transmission rates and host density in a common snail<e2><80><93>oligochaete symbiosis. We then used a well-known contact function from predator<e2><80><93>prey models, the Holling Type II functional response, to describe and predict host snail contact rates in the laboratory. The Holling Type II functional response accurately described both the nonlinear contact<e2><80><93>density relationship and the average contact duration that we observed. Therefore, we suggest that contact rates saturate with host density in this system because each snail contact requires a non-instantaneous handling time, and additional possible contacts do not occur during that handling time. Handling times and nonlinear contact rates might also explain the nonlinear relationship between symbiont transmission and snail density that we observed in the field, which could be confirmed by future work that controls for other potential sources of seasonal variation in transmission rates. Because most animal contacts are not instantaneous, the Holling Type II functional response might be broadly relevant to diverse host<e2><80><93>symbiont systems.},

title={Temporal variation in total phosphorus concentrations revealed from a multidecadal monitoring program on Big Platte Lake, Michigan},
abstract={Effective water quality management depends on enactment of appropriately designed monitoring programs to reveal current and forecasted conditions. Because water quality conditions are influenced by numerous factors, commonly measured attributes such as total phosphorus (TP) can be highly temporally varying. For highly varying processes, monitoring programs should be long-term and periodic quantitative analyses are needed so that temporal trends can be distinguished from stochastic variation, which can yield insights into potential modifications to the program. Using generalized additive mixed modeling, we assessed temporal (yearly and monthly) trends and quantified other sources of variation (daily and subsampling) in TP concentrations from a multidecadal depth-specific monitoring program on Big Platte Lake, Michigan. Yearly TP concentrations decreased from the late 1980s to late 1990s before rebounding through the early 2000s. At depths of 2.29 to 13.72<c2><a0>m, TP concentrations have cycled around stationary points since the early 2000s, while at the surface and depths <e2><89><a5><e2><80><89>18.29 concentrations have continued declining. Summer and fall peaks in TP concentrations were observed at most depths, with the fall peak at deeper depths occurring 1<c2><a0>month earlier than shallower depths. Daily sampling variation (i.e., variation within a given month and year) was greatest at shallowest and deepest depths. Variation in subsamples collected from depth-specific water samples constituted a small fraction of total variation. Based on model results, cost-saving measures to consider for the monitoring program include reducing subsampling of depth-specific concentrations and reducing the number of sampling depths given observed consistencies across the program period.},

abstract={Carotenoid-based signals may function as indicators of individual quality because, being exclusively obtained from the diet, they indicate the ability of individuals to intake high-quality food. Moreover, carotenoids are involved in several important physiological functions, including antioxidant defense, so that carotenoid-based colorations have been suggested to reflect the antioxidant status of their bearers. The present correlative, cross-sectional study aimed at investigating if the skin carotenoid-based coloration is a signal of antioxidant defenses in the brown trout (Salmo trutta Linnaeus, 1758). We investigated the relationships between carotenoid-based coloration traits (including the number, density and redness of red spots, as well as the ventral yellowness), and both non-enzymatic (plasma and liver total antioxidant capacity) and enzymatic antioxidant defenses (activity of hepatic superoxide dismutase<c2><a0><e2><80><94>SOD, catalase<c2><a0><e2><80><94>CAT and glutathione peroxidase<c2><a0><e2><80><94>GPx).

Brown trout individuals displaying intense carotenoid-based coloration (i.e., ventral yellowness) had a high non-enzymatic antioxidant capacity both in plasma and in liver and, interestingly, an elevated activity of hepatic SOD and CAT. Our data suggest that carotenoid-based skin colorations may be considered a signal of individual quality in terms of antioxidant defenses in the brown trout.},

title={Practical fertilization procedure and embryonic development of the New Zealand geoduck clam (Panopea zelandica)},
abstract={Cultivation of the geoduck Panopea zelandica (Quoy & Gaimard, 1835) requires knowledge on embryonic development to produce spat in hatcheries. This study investigated the development of P. zelandica embryos at 15<c2><b0>C and 35 ppt and the optimal sperm:egg ratios for fertilization under hatchery conditions. Panopea zelandica broodstock were induced to spawn by serotonin injection. Sperm and eggs were collected and fertilization was conducted at sperm:egg ratios of: 50:1, 100:1, 500:1, 1000:1 and 10,000:1 over 40 min. The optimal sperm:egg ratio was <500:1 and the normal embryo yield at 3 and 18 h post-fertilization (hpf) ranged from 83-96%. Panopea zelandica eggs (~80[...]m diameter) developed the first and second polar bodies within 15-20 and 50-55 min post-fertilization, respectively. The blastula appeared at ~8 hpf, including the XR and XL cells and the presumptive shell field depression. Gastrulation occurred at 12-18 hpf with organic material apparent at the shell field depression. The mid-stage trochophore, which appeared at around 35 hpf had an apical plate with an apical tuft. The shell field spread to form the periostracum, which expanded and folded into right and left segments covering the late trochophore. The early D-stage veliger appeared at 45 hpf with the soft body being enclosed by two valves and the appearance of the velum. These observations will serve as the basis for future analyses of P. zelandica embryogenesis and for optimization of commercial production of D-veliger larvae.},

title={Association of textile industry effluent with mutagenicity and its toxic health implications upon acute and sub-chronic exposure},
abstract={Complex industrial discharges pose certain risks to the ecosystem. This study was aimed at identifying acute and sub-chronic toxicological effects of the textile industry wastewater. The textile wastewater was evaluated for the metals and organic pollutants by atomic absorption spectrophotometer and GC-MS respectively. In vitro genotoxicity and mutagenicity were assessed by Comet assay in peripheral lymphocytes isolated from Ovis aries and Ames test in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA-100 and 102 respectively. Physiological and behavioral changes along with systemic toxicity were determined in Rattus norvegicus albinus following acute and sub-chronic exposure. High amount of heavy metals such as Cr, Pb, Hg, As, and Cd were detected in textile wastewater. Organic pollutants such as 25-deacetoxy cucurbitacin-b, E-14-Hexadecenal, 11-Tricosene, and phthalates were also found. In vitro genotoxicity assessment in lymphocytes showed statistically significant DNA damaging potential of textile wastewater. Textile wastewater also showed significantly higher (p<cb><82><c2><a0>0.05) mutagenic potential in Salmonella TA-100 and TA-102 strains than sodium azide and 2-amino anthracycline. Acute exposure of textile wastewater to Rattus norvegicus was associated with several physiological changes and behavioral symptoms. Sub-chronic exposure of textile wastewater in Rattus norvegicus instigated the degeneration and necrosis of epithelial cells in renal tubules, hydropic degeneration and necrosis of hepatocytes, peri-bronchiolar infiltration and emphysema of the alveoli, and the degradation of myocardial cells. This study concludes that the textile wastewater may cause genotoxicity and mutagenicity, result in physiological and behavioral changes upon acute exposure, and inflict various pathological lesions upon sub-chronic exposure.},

title={Toxicological Analysis of Acid Mine Drainage by Water Quality and Land Use Bioassays},
abstract={AMD toxicity was evaluated using water quality and land use bioassays. In particular, we determined concentrations for lethal and sublethal effects as part of the risk assessment process. Lactuca sativa (lettuce), Raphanus sativus (radish), and Triticum aestivum (wheat) were used to predict phytotoxic effects caused by metals, as oxidative stress inhibits germination. The results, expressed as the fraction of AMD resulting in 50% lethality (LC50) at 144Â h, showed that wheat was more tolerant (LC50â€‰=â€‰62%) than radish (LC50â€‰=â€‰17.0%) or lettuce (LC50â€‰=â€‰21%). The AMD was found to be very toxic to Daphnia magna (cladoceran) and Danio rerio (zebrafish) embryos, two of the best model organisms in aquatic ecology and ecotoxicology (LC50 <1%). However, when EDTA was used to chelate the metals, the animal toxicity effects was essentially eliminated, pointing to metal content as the main driver of toxicity. Analysis of two molecular biomarkers for an organic pollutantâ€™s toxicity, cyp19a1b and cyp1a, showed no activation of either gene, further indicating that the toxicity was mainly associated with the metals. The results also suggest that the environmental risk associated with the AMD could be largely mitigated by relatively cheap and simple measures to reduce metal mobility, like liming.Alternate abstract:Die ToxizitÃ¤t saurer GrubenwÃ¤sser wurde durch WasserqualitÃ¤ts- und Biomasse-Untersuchungen bewertet.

Lactuca sativa (Salat), Raphanus sativus (Rettich), and Triticum aestivum (Weizen) wurden zur Vorhersage der phytotoxischen Effekte benutzt, die durch Metalle als oxidative Belastung die Keimung behindern. Im Ergebnis, ausgedrÃ¼ckt in der 50% ToxizitÃ¤t (LC50) nach 144 Stunden Exposition mit saurem GrubenwÃ¤ssern, konnte gezeigt werden, dass Weizen (LC50â€‰=â€‰62%) wesentlich toleranter ist als Rettich (LC50â€‰=â€‰17%) oder Salat (LC50â€‰=â€‰21%).

Die Analyse von zwei molekularen Biomarkern fÃ¼r die organische Verschmutzung, cyp19a1b und cyp1a, zeigten keine Aktivierung der anderen Gene und gaben damit einen weiteren Hinweis, dass die Giftigkeit hauptsÃ¤chlich von den Metallen verursacht wird.

Due in part to the Yellowstone PKD episode, but largely because the Tiber and Canyon Ferry reservoirs tested positive for invasive aquatic mussels, Montana's legislature passed Senate Bill 363, which requires all resident and nonresident anglers to purchase an Aquatic Invasive Species Prevention Pass. Two foreign-owned mining companies (Lucky Minerals and Crevice Mining Group) are vying to mine gold beside the Yellowstone River near Paradise Valley's Emigrant Peak and near Jardine just a half mile outside of the park's north gate. [...]it's incomprehensible madness to allow gold mines on the banks of the Yellowstone River just outside the boundaries of our nation's first national park.

title={A Hybrid Lagrangianâ€“Eulerian Particle Model for Ecosystem Simulation},
abstract={Current numerical methods for simulating biophysical processes in aquatic environments are typically constructed in a grid-based Eulerian framework or as an individual-based model in a particle-based Lagrangian framework. Often, the biogeochemical processes and physical (hydrodynamic) processes occur at different time and space scales, and changes in biological processes do not affect the hydrodynamic conditions. Therefore, it is possible to develop an alternative strategy to grid-based approaches for linking hydrodynamic and biogeochemical models that can significantly improve computational efficiency for this type of linked biophysical model. In this work, we utilize a new technique that links hydrodynamic effects and biological processes through a property-carrying particle model (PCPM) in a Lagrangian/Eulerian framework. The model is tested in idealized cases and its utility is demonstrated in a practical application to Sandusky Bay. Results show the integration of Lagrangian and Eulerian approaches allows for a natural coupling of mass transport (represented by particle movements and random walk) and biological processes in water columns which is described by a nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton-detritus (NPZD) biological model. This method is far more efficient than traditional tracer-based Eulerian biophysical models for 3-D simulation, particularly for a large domain and/or ensemble simulations.},

abstract={Background Panopea generosa is a large and long-lived infaunal clam with a considerable commercial value in Canada, United States and Mexico, in need of population genetic studies across its range of distribution. Goals We set to develop new genetic markers (microsatellites) specific for P. generosa. Methods We tested 30 microsatellite loci generated using next-generation genome sequencing (Illumina Hi-Seq 2500). Results We identified eight as suitable polymorphic genetic markers. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 5 to 22 and heterozygosity from 0.429 to 0.818 (observed) and from 0.548 to 0.962 (expected). Deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was found in three loci, after Dunn-[amp]#352;id<c3><a1>k correction, as a result of heterozygote deficiencies suggesting the presence of null alleles and linkage disequilibrium was found between two loci. Conclusions These markers are highly informative and useful for population genetic studies aimed at informing management and conservation measures of this valuable resource.},

title={Exploring Dynamics of the Chlorophyll <i>a</i>-Total Phosphorus Relationship at the Lake-Specific Scale: a Bayesian Hierarchical Model},
abstract={Lake eutrophication has become a worldwide challenge, and the empirical chlorophyll a-total phosphorus (Chla-TP) relationship provides a management target for TP concentrations. Neglecting the dynamics of the relationship at the lake-specific scale would mislead the eutrophication control strategy. The Bayesian hierarchical model (BHM) is a flexible tool to explore dynamics of the Chla-TP relationship and improves the overall estimation accuracy by partial pooling of data. In this study, we used the BHM to show the spatial and seasonal dynamics of the Chla-TP relationship in one of the most eutrophic lakes in China (Lake Dianchi). We defined an indicator (the Chla/TP ratio, CPR), to represent the susceptibility of Chla to TP. We conducted a model selection process and used the CPR-TP curves to show the spatial and seasonal dynamics of the Chla-TP relationships. We determined that the wind caused the spatial dynamics due to the horizontal transport of phytoplankton, while the water temperature and the percentage of soluble reactive phosphorus led to the seasonal dynamics via increasing the growth rate of phytoplankton. These findings helped the eutrophication control in Lake Dianchi. We found that compared with the strategy to decrease the TP concentration, decreasing the susceptibility is expected to be more effective. Finally, we concluded that exploring the dynamics of the Chla-TP relationship provided an important basis for eutrophication control at the lake-specific scale.},

abstract={Due to their antimicrobial, electrical and magnetic properties, copper nanoparticles (NPs) are suitable for a vast array of applications. Copper can be toxic to biota, making it necessary to assess the potential hazard of copper nanomaterials. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed to 10<e2><80><89><c2><b5>g Cu/L of CuO NPs of <e2><89><88>100<e2><80><89>nm (CuO-poly) or ionic copper to compare the effects provoked after 3 and 21 days of exposure and at 6 months post-exposure (mpe). At 21 days, significant copper accumulation was only detected in fish exposed to ionic copper. Exposure to both copper forms caused histopathological alterations that could reduce gill functionality, more markedly in the case of ionic copper. Nevertheless, at 6 mpe higher prevalences of gill lesions were detected in fish previously exposed to CuO-poly NPs. No relevant histological alterations were detected in liver, but the lysosomal membrane stability test showed significantly impaired general health status after exposure to both metal forms that lasted up to 6 mpe. 69 transcripts appeared regulated after 3 days of exposure to CuO-poly NPs, suggesting that NPs could produce oxidative stress and reduce metabolism and transport processes. Thirty transcripts were regulated after 21 days of exposure to ionic copper, indicating possible DNA damage. Genes of the circadian clock were identified as the key genes involved in time-dependent differences between the two copper forms. In conclusion, each copper form showed a distinct pattern of liver transcriptome regulation, but both caused gill histopathological alterations and long lasting impaired health status in adult zebrafish.},

This method was implemented with success to determine antibiotics in samples collected from four wastewater treatment plants and five coasts in Tunisia. Results showed the presence of high concentrations of antibiotics that ranged from 0.1 to 646 ng mL<e2><88><92>1, which can induce many negative impacts on health and the environment. For this reason, we have opted to evaluate toxicity of wastewater samples using a battery of biotests. In fact, genotoxicity was assessed using three tests: Vitotox, comet and micronucleus assays. The input and output of wastewater treatment plants induced a strongly genotoxic effect on the Salmonella typhimurium TA104 prokaryotic Vitotox assay. This result was confirmed using the comet and the micronucleus assays performed on the human liver hepatocellular carcinoma cells. The genotoxic power of the tested wastewater treatment plants' samples could be attributed to the presence of the higher quantities of antibiotics that are detected in these samples and to the antibiotic and organic compound cocktails.},

abstract={Wedge clam, Donax scortum occurrence was studied from February 2009 to January 2010 in Padukere sandy beach, Karnataka (India). The following biological parameters were measured in 2367 individuals of the wedge clam, Donax scortum: length, breadth, width, total weight, shell weight, wet meat weight, dry meat weight and number of clams. The calculated linear equation of length-breadth and length-width relationships were B = 3.5968 + 0.5421L and W = 0.8191 + 0.4345L respectively. The length-total weight, length-wet meat weight, length-dry meat weight and length-shell weight relationships were 0.0001414L3.0224, W = 0.0000037L3.5204, W = 0.0000011L3.4513 and 0.0000852L2.9912 respectively. The values of correlation coefficient for different shell dimensional relationships were very close to unity. It was clear from the study that the most ideal period for clam harvest was April, June and December, especially when condition index was maximum. Length showed a strong correlation with silt and clay. Dry meat weight was negatively correlated with air temperature. Shell weight showed positive correlation with length, breadth, width and dry meat weight, and abiotic parameters, silt and clay. Condition index was positively correlated with electrical conductivity, whereas it was negatively correlated with dissolved oxygen. It showed a strong positive correlation with salinity. Seasonal fluctuation of condition index in D. scortum was probably related to reproductive activity. The harvesting of wedge clam could be carried out considering the maximum sustainable yield without over-exploitation},

This species has been used as bioindicator for evaluating the effects of different chemicals on diverse biological processes and is frequently used as test organism in ecotoxicity studies that include cadmium as reference toxicant. Animals were exposed for 12 days to the following concentrations: 0, 0.45, and 0.8<e2><80><89>mg<e2><80><89>Cd/L. Food intake, fecal production, specific assimilation, condition factor, mortality percentage, oxygen consumption, oxygen extraction efficiency, specific metabolic rate, ammonia excretion, and ammonia quotient were measured. The overall balance was expressed as scope for growth (SFG). Cadmium-exposed groups showed a significant decrease in food assimilation and condition factor at the end of the exposure. There was an increase in specific metabolic rate and a decrease in SFG in the group exposed to 0.8<e2><80><89>mg<e2><80><89>Cd/L. The condition factor and the SFG appeared as sensitive biomarkers of health status and growth of the animals, respectively. Cadmium-exposed fish reduced food intake, which was reflected in a decreased assimilation with concomitant decline in the external energy supply from feeding. Our results highlight the importance of considering the metabolic status of the test organisms when analyzing the responses of the biomarkers usually used as effect parameters in ecotoxicological evaluations under experimental conditions.},

abstract={We studied contribution of benthic invertebrates to the dissolved phosphates flux from the bottom sediments to the water in an oligotrophic lake (Lake Krivoe, near the White Sea biological station "Kartesh", Northern European Russia) in 2009-2013 with the aim to quantify specific (among and within taxa), spatial (littoral and deep sites) and seasonal variability. The excretion rates (Pexc) of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) were estimated in experiment with dominating taxa of benthic invertebrates (amphipods, oligochaetes, mollusks, and chironomids), freshly collected from the lake. Mass-specific P excretion rate was calculated as Pexc divided by animal dry mass and further used for calculations of benthic P efflux rates. Also, in other experimental series with and without animals (amphipods) we measured extracellular alkaline phosphatase activity. The results showed that the SRP excretion rates varied significantly between taxa and between different-sized individuals within the same taxa (the SRP excretion rate elevates with an increase in individual weight). Notable spatial and seasonal differences in biomass of benthic animals and phosphorus released by them in the lake were found. The calculated phosphorus efflux by excretory activity of benthic animals was more intensive in littoral sites (up to 14.4 nmol m-2d-1 in July), that 7 times greater than maximum efflux in deep areas (2.2 nmol m-2d-1). The mobile burrowing animals (the amphipods Gammarus lacustris, Monoporeia affinis, and Gammaracanthus loricatus) are able to move from the bottom sediments to water and transfer the nutrient; they contributed 80 % of P flux caused by benthic excretion in the lake and affected the activity of the extracellular alkaline phosphatase, increasing its level in water 3-8 times relative to that in the control (without animals). The high phosphatase activity may increase phosphorus bioavailability by catalyzing hydrolysis of organic phosphorus, and further stimulate primary producers.},

Results show that total Chl a levels in the surface seawater of the Sanggou Bay generally range from 0.10 to 20.46 Î¼g/L, with an average value of 2.13 Î¼g/L. Nano-phytoplankton was the most important size-fraction and accounted for about 65.1% of total Chl a. In order to evaluate the importance of the â€œprotozoan trophic linkâ€ for energy transfer from the microbial loop to filter-feeding feeders, Zhikong scallop Chlamys farreri was then offered a natural planktonic community as potential prey. Results show that scallops obtained carbon source from natural plankton with the rate of 11 033.05 Î¼g/(gÂ·d). Protists (nanoflagellates and ciliates) were the dominant source of carbon retained by scallop (48.78%). The microbial loop provided 58.45% of the carbon source for farmed scallops. These results indicate that the microbial loop represent a valuable trophic resource in mariculture system of the Sanggou Bay.},

The KSI is based on nine ecosystem variables and provides information on each variable and the combined index. We present examples of application of the KSI to lake management and conduct a sensitivity analysis of the underlying assumptions demonstrating its robustness to the assumptions. While the index presented here is specific to Lake Kinneret, it is a general approach that can be readily applied to lakes worldwide and can assist, for example, in achievement of the required good status for European lakes.},

title={Bio-optical Properties of Cyanobacteria Blooms in Western Lake Erie},
abstract={There is a growing use of remote sensing observations for detecting and quantifying freshwater cyanobacteria populations, yet the inherent optical properties of these communities in natural settings, fundamental to bio-optical algorithms, are not well known. Towards bridging this knowledge gap, we measured a full complement of optical properties in western Lake Erie during cyanobacteria blooms in the summers of 2013 and 2014. Our measurements focus attention on the optical uniqueness of cyanobacteria blooms, which have consequences for remote sensing and bio-optical modeling. We found the cyanobacteria blooms in the western basin during our field work were dominated by Microcystis, while the waters in the adjacent central basin were dominated by Planktothrix. Chlorophyll concentrations ranged from 1 to over 135 ${\mu}g/L$ across the study area with the highest concentrations associated with Microcystis in the western basin. We observed large, amorphous colonial Microcystis structures in the bloom area characterized by high phytoplankton absorption and high scattering coefficients with a mean particle backscatter ratio at 443nm greater than 0.03, which is higher than other plankton types and more comparable to suspended inorganic sediments. While our samples contained mixtures of both, our analysis suggests high contributions to the measured scatter and backscatter coefficients from cyanobacteria. Our measurements provide new insights into the optical properties of cyanobacteria blooms, and indicate that current semi-analytic models are likely to have problems resolving a closed solution in these types of waters as many of our observations are beyond the range of existing model components. We believe that different algorithm or model approaches are needed for these conditions, specifically for phytoplankton absorption and particle backscatter components. From a remote sensing perspective, this presents a challenge not only in terms of a need for new algorithms, but also for determining when to apply the best algorithm for a given situation. These results are new in the sense that they represent a complete description of the optical properties of freshwater cyanobacteria blooms, and are likely to be representative of bloom conditions for other systems containing Microcystis cells and colonies.},

title={Data pre-treatment and choice of resemblance metric affect how fatty acid profiles depict known dietary origins},
abstract={Fatty acids (FA) are increasingly being used in ecology to qualitatively infer diets of consumers. Analysis of FA data requires standardization to express FAs either in mg g-1 lipids, mg g-1 tissue, or as percentages of the total mass of FAs. Additionally, various transformations [square root, arcsin, log(X + 1), log-ratio, etc.] are often used to differentially weight the contribution of less abundant FAs. The choice of standardization unit and transformation can affect interpretations of results and ultimately our understanding of trophic relationships. Data from published feeding experiments were analyzed with visualization (i.e., nMDS) and multivariate rank-based methods (i.e. Mantel Tests) to evaluate how choice of standardization, transformation, and resemblance metric (i.e., Euclidean distance, Bray-Curtis similarities, etc.) reflects known dietary treatment groups. Our results indicate that diet interpretations were best inferred from data standardized to the total mass of FAs quantified. We found transforming data provided only weak advantages for discriminating among diet groups. Euclidean distances between FA proportions represented the known dietary differences to a high degree, are relatively easily interpretable, are applicable to a wide variety of statistical techniques, and are thus a reasonable choice of metric when analyzing FA proportions.},

We investigated the effects of potassium and the potassium: sodium (K+: Na+) ratio in freshwater on growth performance and oxidative stress in a typical northern species of whitefish, Coregonus lavaretus. Fish were subjected to 0.8 mM Na and 4.4 mM K, which corresponds to the K+:Na+ ratio in a lake contaminated by mining wastes from the Kostomuksha iron mine and ore dressing mill in northwestern Russia.The control group was subjected to water with similar mineralization levels and equal amounts of Na and K approximately 0.3 mM of each). Potassium excess caused a decrease in fish growth rate and oxidative stress, as indicated by the level of lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde (MDA). Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity and the level of reduced glutathione (GSH) were not affected by cation composition.},

abstract={Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are increasingly used in several industrial and household products because of their antibacterial and antifungal properties. Hence, there is an inevitable risk that these chemicals may end up in aquatic biotopes and have adverse effects on the fauna. In order to assess potential health effects on aquatic organisms, this study evaluated the effects of waterborne AgNP exposure for 7 days on a set of critical stress parameters in juvenile Caspian kutum (Rutilus kutum), an economically important fish in the Caspian Sea. The applied level 11<c2><a0>[mu]g/l of AgNP is high compared to reported water concentrations and corresponds to 40% of the 96 h LC50 value, initially determined to be 28<c2><a0>[mu]g/l. Gill heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) mRNA expression, Na+/K+-ATPase activity and enzymatic activities of liver superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (Gpx), lactate dehyrogenase (LDH) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and whole-body cortisol and thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) were measured as endpoints. Gill hsp70 mRNA expression increased and gill Na+/K+-ATPase activity decreased in AgNP-exposed fish compared to controls. The specific activities of all liver enzymes decreased significantly compared to controls. Whole-body cortisol and thyroid hormones decreased compared to controls. In conclusion, the study demonstrates that AgNPs cause oxidative stress and gill osmoregulatory disruption in Caspian kutum juveniles.},

title={Relationships among cyanobacteria, zooplankton and fish in sub-bloom conditions in the Sulejow Reservoir},
abstract={The occurrence of cyanobacteria is particularly characteristic of shallow eutrophic waters, and they often form massive <e2><80><98>blooms<e2><80><99> that can affect aquatic invertebrates and fish. However, even a low abundance of cyanobacteria can be hazardous to aquatic organisms, due to the production of toxic metabolites. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between cyanobacteria and their toxicity (biological activity) towards zooplankton and fish communities, when only low concentrations of cyanobacterial chlorophyll a (less than 20 <ce><bc>g L-1) are detected, i.e. in sub-bloom conditions. Measurements were performed in Sulejow Reservoir (Central Poland), a shallow, lowland, eutrophic reservoir, in which cyanobacterial blooms occur regularly. Fish were assessed using echo-sounding (distribution) and by gillnetting (species composition). Simultaneously, zooplankton, cyanobacteria and physico-chemical characteristics were studied at 14 stations situated along hydroacoustic transects. Parameters that characterized the cyanobacteria (cyanobacterial chlorophyll a concentration, the number of 16S rRNA and the mcyA gene copies and microcystin (MC) concentration) were consistently correlated (based on a principal component analysis), and the highest values were found in the downstream region of the study area. This <e2><80><98>cyano-complex<e2><80><99> was also positively correlated with oxygen concentration, pH and phosphate levels, but was negatively correlated with temperature and the concentrations of nitrates and nitrites. In Sulejow Reservoir in 2013 the biomass of large zooplankton filter feeders decreased along with increasing MC concentration and fish densities, while small filter feeders did not present such relationships with regards to fish densities. Fish abundance tended to decrease at stations with a lower abundance of cyanobacteria and with growing toxic genotype copies and MC concentration.},

abstract={Among the polychaetes, the Syllidae comprise numerous species whose study over many years has benefitted from valuable revisions and descriptions of new species in Europe. This abundant literature proves very useful for revisiting the taxonomy and distribution of the Syllidae in the English Channel (EC), mainly as regards existing studies on coarse sediment communities in the eastern part of the Channel. This habitat is one of the most widespread in the EC and is known as favourable for the small polychaete fauna including Syllidae. A 2-year survey (winter and summer sampling periods) covering 19 stations, associated with the Branchiostoma lanceolatum coarse sand community offshore Dieppe-Le Tr<c3><a9>port, led to the identification of 6537 individuals from 29 taxa including 27 species. Six fine sand stations were also sampled in which only 12 individuals were collected. Among these species, seven are new for the EC polychaete fauna and six others are observed for the first time in the eastern part of the EC. All the new species for the EC are warm temperate species previously only known south of the Bay of Biscay. The Syllidae list given in Dauvin et al. (2003) has been re-analysed and amended with our list and that of the Chausey Archipelago study (Olivier et al., 2012). To date, 91 Syllidae species have been recorded in the EC and are established mostly in coarse sediments.},

title={Fixed-Nitrogen Loss Associated with Sinking Zooplankton Carcasses in a Coastal Oxygen Minimum Zone (Golfo Dulce, Costa Rica)},
abstract={Oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) in the ocean are of key importance for pelagic fixed-nitrogen loss (N-loss) through microbial denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox). Recent studies document that zooplankton is surprisingly abundant in and around OMZs and that the microbial community associated with carcasses of a large copepod species mediates denitrification. Here, we investigate the complex N-cycling associated with sinking zooplankton carcasses exposed to the steep O2 gradient in a coastal OMZ (Golfo Dulce, Costa Rica). 15N-stable-isotope enrichment experiments revealed that the carcasses of abundant copepods and ostracods provide anoxic microbial hotspots in the pelagic zone by hosting intense anaerobic N-cycle activities even in the presence of ambient O2. Carcass-associated anaerobic N-cycling was clearly dominated by dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) at up to 30.8 nmol NH4+ individual-1 d-1, followed by denitrification (up to 10.8 nmol N2-N individual-1 d-1), anammox (up to 1.6 nmol N2-N individual-1 d-1), and N2O production (up to 1.2 nmol N2O-N individual-1 d-1). In contrast, anaerobic N-cycling mediated by free-living bacteria proceeded mainly through anammox and denitrification in the anoxic bottom water, which underpins the distinctive microbial metabolism associated with zooplankton carcasses. Pelagic N-loss is potentially enhanced by zooplankton carcasses both directly through N2 and N2O production, and indirectly through NH4+ production that may fuel free-living anammox bacteria. We estimate that in the hypoxic water layer of Golfo Dulce, carcass-associated N2 and N2O production enhance N-loss as much as 1.4-fold at a relative carcass abundance of 36%. In the anoxic bottom water, however, N-loss is likely enhanced only marginally due to high ambient rates and low zooplankton abundance. Thus, zooplankton carcasses may enhance N-loss mainly at the hypoxic boundaries of OMZs which are usually more extensive in open-ocean than in coastal settings. Notably, these contributions by zooplankton carcasses to pelagic N-loss remain undetected by conventional, incubation-based rate measurements.},

This research aims to identify the main environmental drivers of A. islandica valve gape to clarify the ambiguity surrounding its seasonal activity. A lander was deployed from February 2014 to September 2015 on the sea bottom at Ing<c3><b8>ya, Norway (71<c2><b0>03'N, 24<c2><b0>05'E) containing living A. islandica specimens (70.17<c2><a0><c2><b1><c2><a0>0.95 mm SE) in individual containers. Each individual was attached to an electrode unit that measured the distance between their valves (valve gape) every minute. Individuals were followed for various lengths of time, and in some cases replaced by smaller individuals (54.34<c2><a0><c2><b1><c2><a0>0.63 mm SE). The lander was also equipped with instruments to simultaneously monitor temperature, salinity, [Chl-a], turbidity, and light. There was a significant difference in the average monthly valve gape (P value < 0.01), with monthly means of 19-84% of the total valve gape magnitude. The experimental population was largely inactive October-January, with an average daily gape <23%. During this period the clams opened at high amplitude once or twice a month for 1-3 days. Seasonal cycles of sea water temperature and [Chl-a] were temporally offset from each other, with temperature lagging [Chl-a] by about 2 months. Multiple regression analyses showed that bivalve gaping activity was most closely correlated with variable [Chl-a], and to a much smaller degree with photoperiod and temperature.},

abstract={Chlamys farreri is an economically important mollusk that can accumulate excessive amounts of cadmium (Cd). Studying the molecular mechanism of Cd accumulation in bivalves is difficult because of the lack of genome background. Transcriptomic analysis based on high-throughput RNA sequencing has been shown to be an efficient and powerful method for the discovery of relevant genes in non-model and genome reference-free organisms. Here, we constructed two cDNA libraries (control and Cd exposure groups) from the digestive gland of C. farreri and compared the transcriptomic data between them. A total of 227 673 transcripts were assembled into 105 071 unigenes, most of which shared high similarity with sequences in the NCBI non-redundant protein database. For functional classification, 24 493 unigenes were assigned to Gene Ontology terms. Additionally, EuKaryotic Ortholog Groups and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses assigned 12 028 unigenes to 26 categories and 7 849 unigenes to five pathways, respectively. Comparative transcriptomics analysis identified 3 800 unigenes that were differentially expressed in the Cd-treated group compared with the control group. Among them, genes associated with heavy metal accumulation were screened, including metallothionein, divalent metal transporter, and metal tolerance protein. The functional genes and predicted pathways identified in our study will contribute to a better understanding of the metabolic and immune system in the digestive gland of C. farreri. In addition, the transcriptomic data will provide a comprehensive resource that may contribute to the understanding of molecular mechanisms that respond to marine pollutants in bivalves.},

abstract={The present study assessed the effects of a white fluorescent bulb (the control) and two different light-emitting diodes (blue LEDs, LDB; red, LDR) on growth, morphology, and oxidative stress in the liver and ovary of zebrafish for 5 weeks. Growth maintained relatively constant under LDB condition, but was reduced under LDR condition. In the liver, hepatosomatic index (HSI) and protein carbonylation (PC) increased under LDR condition, whereas lipid peroxidation (LPO) declined and HSI remained unchanged under LDB condition. The decrease in oxidative damage by LDB could be attributed to the up-regulated levels of mRNA, protein, and activity of Cu/Zn-SOD and CAT. A failure to activate the activity of both enzymes may result in the enhanced PC levels under LDR condition, though both genes were up-regulated at transcriptional and translational levels. In the ovary, although gonadosomatic index sharply increased under LDR condition, LPO and PC dramatically accumulated. The increase in oxidative damage by LDR might result from the down-regulated levels of protein and activity of Cu/Zn-SOD and CAT, though both genes were up-regulated at a transcriptional level. Furthermore, a sharp increase in expression of transcription factor Nrf2 that targets antioxidant genes was observed in the liver but not in the ovary under LDB and LDR conditions. In conclusion, our data demonstrated a positive effect of LDB and negative effect of LDR on fish antioxidant defenses, emphasizing the potentials of LDB as an effective light source in fish farming.},

abstract={Abstract. The development of highly efficient fibres by a simple preparation method is still a research focus for solid-phase microextraction (SPME). A facile reaction was used to generate a silver coating on silver wire for SPME. The reaction of silver with hydrogen peroxide is very slow, but the formation of [Ag(NH3)2]+ by adding ammonia reduces the electrode potential and increases the reaction rate. The silver fibre was characterised by scanning electron microscopy. Using gas chromatography, the silver fibre was evaluated using polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as model analytes. Under optimised extraction conditions, an analysis method was established. A wide linear range (0.06-100??g?L?1) with a good linear coefficient (0.9896-0.9995) and a low detection limit (0.02-0.10??g?L?1) were achieved. The analysis method was used to analyse rainwater and lake water, and achieved a satisfactory recovery (86.3-119?%). The results indicate that the proposed silver fibre has practical applications in environmental analysis.},

abstract={Purpose Treated and processed sewage sludges (biosolids) generated during the treatment of wastewater usually contain substantial concentrations of nutrients, especially phosphorus, which is essential for plant growth. Sewage sludge therefore can be used as an alternative fertiliser in agriculture. But since sewage sludge could also contain pollutants, analysis and ecotoxicological tests on affected soil and stream water organisms are necessary in order to guarantee its harmless use. Materials and methods Three test species were chosen to cover the environmental compartments, water, sediment and soil. The following test species and parameters were applied to evaluate the acute effects of three sewage sludge samples: Lemna minor (growth inhibition, discolouration and colony breakup), Gammarus fossarum (mortality, behaviour) and Eisenia fetida (avoidance behaviour). Chemical assessment included nutrients, organic pollutants and heavy metals. Results and discussion The assessment of a non-dewatered sludge (S1) sample resulted in an inhibition of growth of L. minor starting from 0.6 g total solid (TS)l-1 after 7 days (EC50 1.2 g TS l-1). G. fossarum displayed significantly decreased movement activity at 0.5 and 1.2 g TS l-1 sludge concentration during an exposure time of 2 days, leading to decreased survival after 4 days of exposure in 0.5 g TS l-1 (LC50 0.5 g TS l-1). After 2 days, E. fetida exhibited an increased avoidance behaviour of contaminated soil from 0.2 g TS kg-1 sewage sludge (EC50 0.4 g TS kg-1). The dewatered sludge samples (S2 and S3) had a lower toxic effect on the test organisms. G. fossarum was the most sensitive test species in the applied test setups. The realistic application amounts of the tested sewage sludge samples of approximately 6.0 g TS kg-1 (maximum allowed application amount of sewage sludge) and approximately 3 g TS kg-1 (maximum agronomical relevant application amount) in worst case studies are higher than the analysed EC50/LC50 values of S1 and of the LC50 (G. fossarum) of S2 and S3. Conclusions All three tested sewage sludge samples have to be classified as toxic at high concentration levels under laboratory conditions. Realistic output quantities of S1 will negatively influence soil invertebrates and freshwater organisms (plants and crustacean), whereas the dewatered sludge samples will most likely not have any acute toxic effect on the test organisms in the field. Test with environmental samples should be conducted in order to support this hypothesis.},

title={Impact of operational parameters on biofiltration performance: organic carbon removal and effluent turbidity},
abstract={The objectives of this pilot-scale study were to optimize backwash frequency and empty bed contact time (EBCT) of biofilters treating ozonated surface water from Lake Ontario. Performance was benchmarked in terms of the reduction of turbidity, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), disinfection by-product (DBP) precursors, and ultrafiltration foulants (biopolymers). Increasing the EBCT from 4 to 8 min resulted in a higher reduction of DOC (5%), trihalomethane (THM4) and haloacetic acid (HAA9) precursors (<e2><88><bc>12%) without negatively impacting effluent turbidity (consistently below 0.4 NTU), while biopolymer removal remained unaffected (2%). The impact of varying backwash frequency (5, 10, and 25 day intervals) was also compared for biofilters operated at an EBCT of 4 min. Results showed no impact of extended run times (up to 25 days) on DOC or DBP precursor removal; however turbidity removal was affected beyond 15 days of operation. Backwashing biofilters at 10 vs 5 day intervals would result in a reduction of backwash water, energy consumption and amount to nearly $17,000 in savings for the utility.},

title={Matching Forces Applied in Underwater Hull Cleaning with Adhesion Strength of Marine Organisms},
abstract={Biofouling is detrimental to the hydrodynamic performance of ships. In spite of advances in hull coating technology, a ship must usually undergo underwater hull cleaning to remove biofouling during her in-service time. However, some cleaning practices may also lead to decreased lifetime of the fouling-control coating. Therefore, cleaning forces should be minimized, according to the adhesion strength of marine organisms present on the hull. In this article, values of adhesion strength found in available literature are discussed in the light of current knowledge on hull cleaning technology. Finally, the following knowledge gaps are identified: (1) data on adhesion strength of naturally-occurring biofouling communities are practically absent; (2) shear forces imparted by current cleaning devices on low-form fouling (microfouling) and corresponding effects on hull coatings are largely unknown. This knowledge would be valuable for both developers and users of cleaning technology.},

abstract={Pharmaceuticals are commonly found in water collected from wastewater treatment plants, fresh water and saline water. Their presence in water may result in constant accumulation in living organisms, and consequently a negative impact on those organisms. Abiotic samples collected from the Gulf of Gdansk were already proven to be polluted by several classes of pharmaceuticals, but the bioaccumulation was not investigated as far. This study presents the first results on the accumulation of pharmaceuticals in [Mytilus edulis trossulus] (Gould 1890) mussels collected from the Gulf of Gdansk. The content of target 6 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pharmaceuticals (ibuprofen, flurbiprofen, diclofenac, paracetamol, naproxen, ketoprofen) and 17<ce><b1>-ethynylestradiol in water and tissue samples was determined. The selected pharmaceuticals (paracetamol, flurbiprofen, 17<ce><b1>-ethynylestradiol) were found only in the largest individuals. The in situ BAFs calculated for paracetamol and flurbiprofen were 2850 and 16154 l kg[-1] (dry weight), respectively, suggesting a high potential for the bioaccumulation of these compounds. The synthetic hormone 17<ce><b1>-ethynylestradiol was also found in the collected mussels at the concentration of 310 ng g[-1] of dry weight. Generally, the examined mussels showed poor condition and it is highly likely that the accumulated pharmaceuticals are one of the important factors contributing to this.},

title={Characteristic of Lower Don aquatic ecosystem in late autumn},
abstract={Multidisciplinary studies were carried out in the Lower Don River in the low-water November of 2012. The studies showed relatively low concentrations of oil products (up to 2 MAC) and heavy metals (up to 1 MAC), which were likely due to the cessation of navigation in the river. However, copper concentration was found to be in excess of its MAC. The most polluted were found to be the port water areas of the cities of Volgodonsk, Ust'-Donetsk, and Semikarakorsk. The distribution of nutrients over streams is uneven: the Don water is poorer in nutrients than the waters of the Severskii Donets and the Manych are. Oxbows can serve as depots of organic matter, where it accumulates over longer periods than in the river. The residual manifestations of the summer-autumn blooming of blue-green algae, observed in shallows, the predominance of algae of divisions Cryptophyta and Bacillariophyta (typical representatives of winter planktonic algacenosis), and their low abundance suggest the transitional state of phytoplankton communities to autumn-winter season (pre-winter period). The species diversity and biomass of zooplankton were largest in the Don R. and lowest in the Severskii Donets R. The formation of zooplankton species composition shows the effect of the runoff from the Tsimlyanskoe Reservoir. An increase in the proportion of oligochaetes and invading species was recorded in the Don. The decrease in the diversity of benthos is attributed to natural factors, i.e., the decay of imago and thicket forms in autumn. The biomass of the soft (food) benthos is low because of the predominance of its small-size forms.},

abstract={Triclosan (TCS) is commonly used worldwide in a range of personal care and sanitizing products. The aim of this study was to evaluate potential effects of TCS exposure on embryonic development of Bufo gargarizans, an endemic frog species in China. Standard Gosner stage 3 B. gargarizans embryos were exposed to 10~150[mu]g/L TCS during embryogenesis. Survival, total length, weight, developmental stage, duration of different embryo stages, malformation, and type II and III deiodinase (D2 and D3) expression were measured. Inhibitory effects on embryo developmental stage, total length and weight were found at 30~150[mu]g/L TCS. Moreover, the duration of embryonic development was increased at gastrula, neural, circulation, and operculum development stage in TCS-treated groups. In addition, TCS exposure induced morphological malformations in B. gargarizans embryos, which are characterized by hyperplasia, abdominal edema, and axial flexures. Furthermore, our results showed that the expression of D2 in embryos was probably down-regulated at 60 and 150[mu]g/L TCS, but its spatial expression patterns was not affected by TCS. In summary, our study suggested that TCS exposure not only resulted in delayed growth and development but also caused teratogenic effects in B. gargarizans embryos, and the developmental effects of TCS at high concentrations may be associated with disruption of THs homeostasis. Although further studies are necessary, the present findings could provide a basis for understanding on harmful effects and the potential mechanisms of TCS in amphibian embryos.},

title={Eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, valve gape behavior under diel-cycling hypoxia},
abstract={Hypoxia and anoxia in many estuaries worldwide can cause a wide range of negative effects on animals that are directly exposed or indirectly influenced by food web interactions. Typically, experimental studies focus on animal behavior as a function of continuous exposure to low dissolved oxygen (DO) conditions rather than short-term fluctuations. Dissolved oxygen concentrations [DO] can, however, vary throughout the day, and water can become hypoxic for minutes to hours, often during the late night/early morning hours in the summer. Valve gape of 1-year-old eastern oysters, Crassostrea virginica, from Maryland, USA, was continuously measured while exposed to diel-cycling DO in aquaria during normoxic, hypoxic, and supersaturated phases of the cycle over several 2-day periods (July-August 2012). Severe hypoxia (0.6 mg DO L-1) induced oysters to close for significantly longer times than normoxic (7.3 mg DO L-1) conditions. Oysters exposed to mild hypoxia (1.7 mg DO L-1) closed for a similar amount of time as oysters held at normoxia and severe hypoxia. At severe hypoxia, more than one-third of the oysters closed simultaneously and closed immediately when they encountered severe hypoxia while oysters at mild hypoxia often closed later in the low oxygen phase of the cycles. When normoxia was reintroduced after severe hypoxia, most oysters opened immediately and gaped throughout the period. The results indicate that while 1-year-old oysters responded negatively to diel-cycling low [DO], especially to severe hypoxia, they rapidly opened during the normoxic period that followed, potentially reducing any negative effects of a fluctuating environment.},

In this study, carps (length 23<c2><a0><c2><b1><c2><a0>1.5 cm; weight 13<c2><a0><c2><b1><c2><a0>1.3 g) were divided into six groups of 15 each and exposed to 2.5 and 5.0 mg L-1 of CuO nanoparticles (NPs), 10.0 mg L-1 of TiO2 NPs, and 2.5 and 5.0 mg L-1 of CuO NPs + 10.0 mg L-1 of TiO2 NP mixture. Fish were sampled for histopathological studies after hematoxylin-eosin staining. Results indicated that the more kinds of histopathology anomalies observed with CuO NP and TiO2 NP mixture were broadly of the same type as CuO NPs and TiO2 NPs alone, but the severity or incidence of injuries of gill, intestine, liver, and kidney of carps in the mixture of CuO NPs + TiO2 NPs was higher than that of each NP alone. Moreover, behavioral changes in carps exposed to CuO NP and TiO2 NP mixture such as hyperactivity, loss of balance, and convulsions were higher than those to CuO NPs and TiO2 NPs alone. In conclusion, the presence of TiO2 NPs enhanced the effects of NPs of copper oxide in terms of histopathological changes in carps.},

The main chemicals in these effluents are solvents, detergents, disinfectants--such as sodium hypochlorite (NaClO)--and pharmaceutical products, all of which are potentially ecotoxic. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the oxidative stress induced in the amphipod Hyalella azteca by the effluent from a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-manufacturing plant. The median lethal concentration (72 h-LC 50) was determined and H. azteca were exposed to the lowest observed adverse effect level (0.0732 %) for 12, 24, 48 and 72 h, and biomarkers of oxidative stress were evaluated [hydroperoxide content (HPC), lipid peroxidation (LPX), protein carbonyl content (PCC), and the activity of the superoxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx)]. Statistically significant increases with respect to the control group (P < 0.05) were observed in HPC, LPX and PCC in H. azteca at all exposure times. Antioxidant enzymes activity SOD, CAT and GPx activity also increased significantly (P < 0.05) with respect to the control group. In conclusion, the industrial effluent analyzed in the present study contains NSAIDs and NaClO, and induces oxidative stress in H. azteca.},

abstract={Issue Title: Climatic Change Letters | Edited by Michael Oppenheimer | pages 353-360 The effects of climate change on north temperate freshwater ecosystems include increasing water temperatures and decreasing ice cover. Here we compare those trends in the Laurentian Great Lakes at three spatial scales to evaluate how warming varies across the surface of these massive inland water bodies. We compiled seasonal ice cover duration (1973-2013) and lake summer surface water temperatures (LSSWT; 1994-2013), and analyzed spatial patterns and trends at lake-wide, lake sub-basin, and fine spatial scales and compared those to reported lake- and basin-wide trends. At the lake-wide scale we found declining ice duration and warming LSSWT patterns consistent with previous studies. At the lake sub-basin scale, our statistical models identified distinct warming trends within each lake that included significant breakpoints in ice duration for 13 sub-basins, consistent linear declines in 11 sub-basins, and no trends in 4 sub-basins. At the finest scale, we found that the northern- and eastern-most portions of each Great Lake, especially in nearshore areas, have experienced faster rates of LSSWT warming and shortening ice duration than those previously reported from trends at the lake scale. We conclude that lake-level analyses mask significant spatial and temporal variation in warming patterns within the Laurentian Great Lakes. Recognizing spatial variability in rates of change can inform both mechanistic modeling of ecosystem responses and planning for long-term management of these large freshwater ecosystems.},

title={Effects of endocrine disruptors on reproduction in viviparous teleosts with intraluminal gestation},
abstract={Many water systems worldwide are affected by pollutants, including potential endocrine disruptors (EDs). Most studies on the effects of EDs on fish reproduction have focused on oviparous species. However, some important groups of fishes are not oviparous and there is scarce information about how EDs affect species with alternative reproductive modes. Goodeinae is a viviparous matrotrophic subfamily with intraluminal gestation (IG), where transfer of nutrients occurs and embryos develop inside the ovarian cavity. Goodeinae is endemic to the Mexican Central Plateau, an area affected by potential EDs, including 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). This review synthesizes the available information about EDs in viviparous teleosts with IG and performs a case study on the effects of 2,4-D on gonadal structure of two Goodeinae species. We hypothesized that individuals exposed to 2,4-D might show altered gonadal structure. The available information included effects on gene expression, sexual differentiation, gametogenesis, secondary sexual characteristics, and sexual behavior. Knowledge gaps persisted on the effects of EDs on viviparous teleosts with IG. Holistic approaches are needed to understand the mechanisms underlying endocrine disruption effects. Field studies are needed to evaluate the consequences of EDs on wild populations. The case study revealed histological alterations in oocytes, spermatogonia, and sperm cysts in fishes exposed to 2,4-D. Ultrastructurally, gonads exhibited alterations in oocyte mitochondrial and nuclear membranes, and in spermatid mitochondria. The observed changes could be related to 2,4-D exposure, which may affect species reproduction in their natural environment. Matrotrophic viviparous teleosts with IG may serve as models to explore endocrine disruption.},

abstract={Bivalve mollusks have fascinatingly diverse modes of reproduction. However, research investigating sex determination and reproductive regulation in this group of animals is still in its infancy. In this study, transcriptomes of three ovaries and three testes of Yesso scallop were sequenced and analyzed. Transcriptome comparison revealed that 4394 genes were significantly different between ovaries and testes, of which 1973 were ovary-biased (upregulated in the ovaries) and 2421 were testis-biased. Crucial sex-determining genes that were previously reported in vertebrates and putatively present in bivalves, namely FOXL2, DMRT, SOXH, and SOXE, were investigated. The genes all possessed conserved functional domains and were detected in the gonads. Except for PySOXE, the other three genes were significantly differentially expressed between the ovaries and testes. PyFOXL2 was ovary-biased, and PyDMRT and PySOXH were testis-biased, suggesting that these three genes are likely to be key candidates for scallop sex determination/differentiation. Furthermore, GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were conducted for both ovary- and testis-biased genes. Interestingly, both neurotransmitter transporters and GABAergic synapse genes were overrepresented in the ovary-biased genes, suggesting that neurotransmitters, such as GABA and glycine, are likely to participate in scallop ovary development. Our study will assist in better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying bivalve sex determination and reproductive regulation.},

abstract={Issue Title: Special Issue on Coastal Chemical Oceanography: A tribute to Thomas M. Church Exchange of water between groundwater and surface water could alter water quality of the surface waters and thereby impact its ecosystem. Discharges of anoxic groundwater, with high concentrations of sulfate and chloride and low concentrations of nitrate and oxygen, from three sinkhole vents (El Cajon, Middle Island and Isolated) in Lake Huron have been recently documented. In this investigation, we collected and analyzed a suite of water samples from these three sinkhole vents and lake water samples from Lake Huron for Ra, radon-222, stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen, and other ancillary parameters. These measurements are among the first of their kind in this unique environment. The activities of Ra are found to be one to two orders of magnitude higher than that of the lake water. Isotopic signatures of some of the bottom lake water samples indicate evidences for micro-seeps at distances farther from these three vents. A plot of <ce><b4>D versus <ce><b4>18O indicates that there are deviations from the Global Meteoric Line that can be attributed to mixing of different water masses and/or due to some subsurface chemical reactions. Using the Ra isotopic ratios, we estimated the transit times of the vent waters from the bottom to the top of the vent (i.e., sediment-water interface) to be 4-37 days. More systematic studies on the distribution of the radioactive and stable isotope studies are needed to evaluate the prevalence of micro-seeps in Lake Huron and other Great Lakes system.},

abstract={Lake sediment substantially accumulates nutrients, while little is known regarding the conditions under which it tends to be a sink or source of phosphorus. It is postulated that the above functions were largely dependent on trophic state. To test this hypothesis, composition, abundance, and size-spectrum of phytoplankton were studied in a Chinese shallow lake (Lake Donghu), together with concentrations and sorption behaviors of phosphorus in water column and sediment. Relationships among these variables were also examined by structural equation model. In the basins with the lowest phosphorus concentration, sediment was a phosphorus source as judged by equilibrium phosphorus concentration, directly affecting the abundance of phytoplankton with smaller size. Contrastingly, in the basins with the highest phosphorus concentration, sediment tended to uptake phosphorus, companied by the lowest ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus, diversity, and evenness of phytoplankton with the smaller size one dominating. Oscillatoria sp. was directly affected by ammonia and phosphorus. Moreover, with a balanced exchange of phosphorus between sediment and water column, phytoplankton increased markedly with the highest diversity and evenness in the basins having intermediate phosphorus concentration. Overall, trophic state modulated sediment functions to supply nutrient and was in turn greatly affected by the sediment in shallow lakes.},

Pugnose Eels have stretchable skin around a small, terminal mouth, as well as teeth with a clear cutting edge, a mouth-closing apparatus equipped with large jaw muscles, a large tongue-like secretory structure, and well-developed hyoid and branchial arches to facilitate the transport of large food items in the buccal cavity. A comparison with other species provides several lines of evidence supporting the hypothesis that Pugnose Eels have a feeding apparatus that is equipped for biting off chunks of flesh from prey (Irrespective of whether prey is dead or alive), most likely by using rotational feeding.},

Medium-term (30 days) physiological responses of two groups of juvenile oysters were measured every 10 days. Five replicates were exposed to diets containing A. catenella and other five replicates were fed with a diet containing the non-toxic algae Isochrysis galbana. Diets were continuously supplied at a concentration of 2 mg L-1, in which the feeding and metabolic activity was measured, and the scope for growth calculated. Lipids storage, actual growth and mortality were also measured every 10 days. The results showed that the toxic diet has dramatic negative effects on feeding and metabolism of the juvenile individuals of O. chilensis, with high reduction of the lipid storage and growth. Mortality was also increased in individuals fed with the contaminated diet. This study supports the conclusion that the toxic dinoflagellate A. catenella restricts the energy acquisition in the juvenile O. chilensis, an important fishery and aquaculture resource in southern Chile.},

abstract={The environmental monitoring strategy termed ecosystem-based approach (EBA) underlines the obvious benefits of managing natural resources on a holistic level, and it is particularly invoked for the rational and sustainable management of aquatic resources. However, when coming to implement EBA into monitoring schemes, such as those derived from the implementation of the European legislation concerning water quality, difficulties inherent to the complex and dynamic nature of ecosystems arise, including (i) identify appropriate, relevant and easily measurable indicators of ecosystem integrity, and (ii) combine the heterogeneous information gathered at the different levels of organization included in an ecosystem into a simple and practical decision-making scheme. The first kind of difficulties maybe partially overcome by implementing monitoring schemes which take into account the hierarchical nature of ecosystem processes and did not neglect the use of indicators at low levels of biological organization, including ecotoxicological biomarkers and bioassays. Secondly, the integration of the monitoring results into a practical decision-making scheme can best be achieved by using non metric multivariate analysis, which is especially suitable for data bases including different metrics, and allows the processing of variables showing non-monotonic response to human stress, from molecular biomarkers to community indices. The difficulties inherent to the current rigid scheme of water quality assessment heavily based on ratio-to-reference univariate indicators and arbitrary reference values and class boundaries for each single indicator are illustrated with a case study in the Minho estuary (NW Iberian Peninsula). The classification of aquatic ecosystems into discrete categories of ecological status can best be achieved by combining observations at different levels of biological organization, from molecular biomarkers to community traits, with explicative physicochemical and hydromorphological elements, and by using non-metric multivariate analysis techniques.},

The hemoglobin of T. granosa (Tg-HbI) exhibited two distinct expression patterns at two time points. Our results suggest that the immune response of T. granosa against DOP pollution varies depending on the dose.

Conversely, on the eutrophic ecosystem (the east coast), both species displayed the same diet, which was a mixture of pelagic sources (SPOM), benthic sources (MPB and ULV) and to a lesser extent riverine particulate organic matter (rPOM). These results were explained by the intensity of benthic vs. pelagic couplings (i.e. benthic-pelagic and pelagic-benthic) which differed in the two ecosystems. Low trophic coupling occurred on the mesotrophic (west) coast, whereas benthic-pelagic (SOM resuspension) and pelagic-benthic (settling of SPOM such as phytoplankton blooms) couplings were typified on the eutrophic (east) coast. This higher particulate organic matter (POM) pelagic-benthic coupling on the east coast was probably enhanced by nutrient enrichment caused by eutrophication. Comparison of <ce><b4>^sup 13^C ratios of both the strict deposit-feeder (e.g. A. marina) and the strict suspension-feeder (e.g. C. gigas) was then proposed as a bio-indicator of the trophic status and of POM benthic vs. pelagic couplings of soft-bottom coastal ecosystems.},

title={Aeshnid dragonfly larvae as bioindicators of methylmercury contamination in aquatic systems impacted by elevated sulfate loading},
abstract={Methylmercury (MeHg) levels in dragonfly larvae and water were measured over two years in aquatic systems impacted to varying degrees by sulfate releases related to iron mining activity. This study examined the impact of elevated sulfate loads on MeHg concentrations and tested the use of MeHg in dragonfly larvae as an indicator of MeHg levels in a range of aquatic systems including 16 river/stream sites and two lakes. MeHg concentrations in aeshnid dragonfly larvae were positively correlated (R ^sup 2^ = 0.46, p < 0.01) to peak MeHg concentrations in the dissolved phase for the combined years of 2012 and 2013. This relation was strong in 2012 (R ^sup 2^ = 0.85, p < 0.01), but showed no correlation in 2013 (R ^sup 2^ = 0.02, p > 0.05). MeHg in dragonfly larvae were not elevated at the highest sulfate sites, but rather the reverse was generally observed. Record rainfall events in 2012 and above average rainfall in 2013 likely delivered the majority of Hg and MeHg to these systems via interflow and activated groundwater flow through reduced sediments. As a result, the impacts of elevated sulfate releases due to mining activities were not apparent in these systems where little of the sulfate is reduced. Lower bioaccumulation factors for MeHg in aeshnid dragonfly larvae were observed with increasing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations. This finding is consistent with previous studies showing that MeHg in high DOC systems is less bioavailable; an equilibrium model shows that more MeHg being associated with DOC rather than algae at the base of the food chain readily explains the lower bioaccumulation factors.},

title={Measuring cytochrome P450 activity in aquatic invertebrates: a critical evaluation of in vitro and in vivo methods},
abstract={The first step in xenobiotic detoxification in aquatic invertebrates is mainly governed by the cytochrome P450 mixed function oxidase system. The ability to measure cytochrome P450 activity provides an important tool to understand macroinvertebrates' responses to chemical stressors. However, measurements of P450 activity in small aquatic invertebrates have had variable success and a well characterized assay is not yet available. The general lack of success has been scarcely investigated and it is therefore the focus of the present work. In particular, the suitability of the substrate selected for the assay, the sensitivity of the assay and the possible inhibition/attenuation of enzymatic activity caused by endogenous substances were investigated. 7-ethoxycoumarin-O-dealkylation activity of Daphnia magna, Chironomus riparius larvae and Hyalella azteca was assessed in vivo and in vitro and possible inhibition of enzymatic activity by macroinvertebrates homogenate was investigated. Activities of D. magna and C. riparius larvae measured in vivo were 1.37 <c2><b1> 0.08 and 2.2 <c2><b1> 0.2 pmol h^sup -1^ organism^sup -1^, respectively, while activity of H. azteca could not be detected. In vitro activity could be measured in C. riparius larvae only (500-1000 pmol h^sup -1^ mg microsomal protein^sup -1^). The optimization of the in vitro assay has been especially long and resource consuming and particularly for D. magna, substances that inhibited cytochrome P450 activity seemed to be released during tissue homogenization preventing activity measurements in vitro. We therefore recommend testing the P450 inhibition potential of homogenate preparations prior to any investigation of P450 activity in vitro in macroinvertebrates.},

title={Application of Wastewater and Biosolids in Soil: Occurrence and Fate of Emerging Contaminants},
abstract={Wastewater (WW) for irrigation and application of biosolids in soil is becoming important as it is going to become very common in the near future. By 2050, the world is going to have four billion people living in water-scarce countries, making it a norm of freshwater for the cities and WW for agriculture. Further, biosolids might still be used as green biofertilizers for soils, if they are improved from an ecological point of view. However, application of biosolids in soil is argued because of the amount of organic pollutants that compromise the dynamic equilibrium of the biological systems. Therefore, information on the concentration, behavior, and cycling of organic pollutants as well as their possible degradation pathways is needed to predict, prevent, and remediate these pollutants from different sources including WW and biosolids. Among the group of organic pollutants, emerging contaminants (ECs) enter into the soil with the irrigation water from treated effluents and fertilization by biosolids. Quantification of ECs from WW and biosolids is of main importance to predict the toxic effects of WW effluents and sludge. Moreover, their incorporation into vegetables through irrigation and their magnification through natural food webs have been proved and must be monitored. This review presents information on the different sources of emerging contaminants and linking with the ecological effects they produced by reacting in the environment during various applications of WW and biosolids in soil. The available methods for analysis and quantification of ECs in different matrices, such as WW and biosolids, are also presented.},

title={Metals bioaccumulation in two edible bivalves and health risk assessment},
abstract={Our aim was to quantify the bioaccumulation of 13 metals in two edible bivalves (Ruditapes decussatus and Paphia undulata) in Lake Timsah, Egypt. A potential human health risk assessment was conducted to evaluate the hazards from bivalve consumption. Fe, Al, Zn, and Sr had the highest concentrations in the bivalve samples. The levels of Cd were much lower than the maximum permissible level, while Pb concentrations in the two bivalves were nearly two times the permissible level. The extent of bioaccumulation factor was site- and species-specific. For low and high bivalve-consuming groups, the estimated daily intake of Pb and Cd ranged from 0.01 to 0.76 [mu]g/kg/day. For low and high bivalve-consuming groups, hazard quotients (HQs) for metals were found to be less than 1 for both bivalve species, except for Co in the high-consuming group. In conclusion, even though there was no apparent risk to bivalve consumers from being exposed to single metals, there is a risk from being exposed to the 13 studied metals together, especially for high bivalve-consuming groups such as fishermen.},

Water, molluscs and macrophytes were sampled from the littoral zone in Lake Lednica, NW Poland. The influence of carbon species assimilated during photosynthesis and the net intensity of photosynthesis resulting from the size of charophyte species and the density of their stands were postulated to be the most important factors causing the species-specific <ce><b4>^sup 13^C values of charophyte thalli and encrustations. It was suggested that photosynthetic activity of charophytes affected not only the <ce><b4>^sup 13^C values of charophyte encrustations but also mollusc shells by changing <ce><b4>^sup 13^C values of DIC within charophyte stands. In addition, incorporation of metabolic carbon into the shell was proposed as the main cause of both the ^sup 13^C depletion of mollusc shells relative to <ce><b4>^sup 13^C values of DIC and the species-specific <ce><b4>^sup 13^C values of shells. Mollusc shells were precipitated at the isotope equilibrium or close to the equilibrium with <ce><b4>^sup 18^O values of lake water. Charophyte encrustations were found to be ^sup 18^O depleted due to the kinetic isotope effects during intense photosynthesis and thus fast precipitation of the calcite.},

title={Cyanobacteria in the complex river-connected Poyang Lake: horizontal distribution and transport},
abstract={Bloom-forming cyanobacteria have been observed with increasing frequency in Poyang Lake, China since 2000. In the present study, we examined the mechanisms responsible for the horizontal distribution of these blooms in the main body of Poyang Lake. Specifically, we addressed the hypothesis that colonies of cyanobacteria are first generated in the Eastern Bay (EB, lentic region) and then advected offshore by large-scale horizontal transport processes, with the colonies subsequently found in Northern Poyang Lake (NPL, lotic region). The cyanobacteria biomass in the EB was significantly greater than that in NPL (P < 0.0001), and negative correlations were observed between cyanobacteria biomass and nutrient concentrations in the EB. However, significant correlations were not observed between cyanobacteria biomass and nutrient concentrations in NPL. The peak abundance of cyanobacteria was first observed in the EB, with the cyanobacterial abundance peak in NPL lagging the EB peak by approximately 1 month. These results are all consistent with the cyanobacteria distribution hypothesis and show the potential for the accumulation of cyanobacteria in NPL that are normally considered unsuitable for in situ growth in EB. Variations of cyanobacteria biomass in eutrophic lakes, including Yangtze-connected (Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake) and Yangtze-isolated (Taihu) lakes, were monitored during summer (July-August), and eutrophic or even polytrophic conditions were not observed to support the development of cyanobacteria. Instead, a high rate of water flow with short retention times was the key factor preventing the accumulation of cyanobacteria in these eutrophic lakes. Therefore, the mean cyanobacteria biomass was significantly lower in the Yangtze-connected lakes (Poyang Lake, 1.01 mg l^sup -1^; Dongting Lake, 1.71 mg l^sup -1^) than in Taihu Lake at Meiliang Bay (13.54 mg l^sup -1^) or the mouth (3.45 mg l^sup -1^) (P < 0.0001); however, the biomass more closely resembled Taihu Lake at the center (0.88 mg l^sup -1^). As expected, the cyanobacteria biomass was lower in the lakes with hydraulic connections to the Yangtze River compared with those isolated from the Yangtze River. This study revealed that hydrological parameters dominated the accumulation of cyanobacterial blooms in the Yangtze-connected eutrophic lakes in eastern China.},

title={Marine harmful algal blooms, human health and wellbeing: challenges and opportunities in the 21st century},
abstract={Microalgal blooms are a natural part of the seasonal cycle of photosynthetic organisms in marine ecosystems. They are key components of the structure and dynamics of the oceans and thus sustain the benefits that humans obtain from these aquatic environments. However, some microalgal blooms can cause harm to humans and other organisms. These harmful algal blooms (HABs) have direct impacts on human health and negative influences on human wellbeing, mainly through their consequences to coastal ecosystem services (fisheries, tourism and recreation) and other marine organisms and environments. HABs are natural phenomena, but these events can be favoured by anthropogenic pressures in coastal areas. Global warming and associated changes in the oceans could affect HAB occurrences and toxicity as well, although forecasting the possible trends is still speculative and requires intensive multidisciplinary research. At the beginning of the 21st century, with expanding human populations, particularly in coastal and developing countries, mitigating HABs impacts on human health and wellbeing is becoming a more pressing public health need. The available tools to address this global challenge include maintaining intensive, multidisciplinary and collaborative scientific research, and strengthening the coordination with stakeholders, policymakers and the general public. Here we provide an overview of different aspects of the HABs phenomena, an important element of the intrinsic links between oceans and human health and wellbeing.},

abstract={Tributyltin (TBT), a toxic contaminant in aquatic environments, has bio-accumulated in aquatic food webs throughout the world and can be found at toxic levels in some biota. However, the molecular mechanisms and effects of TBT are not fully understood. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of long-term exposure of TBT on cytochrome P450 (CYP450) 1 regulation and heat-shock proteins (HSPs) profiling in brain of freshwater teleost. The effects of long-term exposure to TBT on mRNA expression of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) 1 family genes and ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity in the brain of common carp were evaluated, as well as HSP 70 level. Fish were exposed to sublethal concentrations of TBT (75 ng/L, 0.75 [mu]g/L and 7.5 [mu]g/L) for 15, 30, and 60 days. Based on the results, long-term exposure (more than 15 days) to TBT could lead to obvious physiological-biochemical responses (based on EROD activity, HSP 70 level and CYP450 1 family genes expression). The mRNA expression of CYP450 1 family genes (CYP1A, CYP1B, CYP1C1 and CYP1C2) suggested that CYP1A was to accommodate most EROD activity in fish, but other CYP450 forms also involved in this proceeding. Thus, the measured physiological responses in fish brain could provide useful information to better understand the mechanisms of TBT-induced bio-toxicity and could be used as potential biomarkers for monitoring the TBT pollution in the field.},

title={Is gamete morphology involved in hybridization in oysters?},
abstract={Some pairs of oyster species in the genus Crassostrea can produce viable hybrids, and heterospecific fertilization may be symmetric, asymmetric, or very low. For example, with C. angulata and C. gigas, fertilization is equally successful whether the mature oocytes come from the first or the second species. Fertilization is asymmetric between C. ariakensis and C. virginica, i.e., it is higher when C. ariakensis is the source of the oocytes. Fertilization success is low between C. ariakensis and C. gigas. These differences probably relate chiefly to molecular mechanisms of gamete recognition, but the present study examines whether the size and certain aspects of gamete morphology may also play a role. Individuals of four species of the genus Crassostrea (Ostreidae: Bivalvia), collected from different geographic regions between 2006 and 2011, C. angulata (Penghu Island, Taiwan Strait), C. ariakensis (Nha Trang Bay, South China Sea), C. gigas (Peter the Great Bay, Sea of Japan), and C. virginica (Galveston Bay, Gulf of Mexico), were examined for conspecific relationships between the thickness of the vitelline envelope in mature oocytes and the size of the acrosome or subacrosomal spaces in spermatozoa. Thicker vitelline envelopes corresponded with bigger acrosomes and subacrosomal spaces in three of the four species. The exception was C. gigas, which has the thickest vitelline envelope, but the lytic compartments in its spermatozoa are not the largest. Moreover, sizes of acrosome, subacrosomal space, and vitelline envelope are similar between the species with symmetric heterospecific fertilization, while difference in sizes of these structures increases the possibility of asymmetric cross-fertilization or decreased fertilization rate.},

abstract={Methylmercury (MeHg) accumulation in aquatic food raises global concerns about human exposure to MeHg. Crayfish is the world's third largest farmed crustacean species and a favorite aquatic food in many countries. However, human health hazard due to MeHg exposure via crayfish consumption is unclear, partly because appropriate survey data are lacking. We report on mercury concentrations and speciation in edible tail muscle of crayfish collected from restaurants in 23 Chinese cities. On average, MeHg constituted 99.1 % of mercury in tail muscle, and MeHg concentrations were comparable with those reported for fish in China. Variation in MeHg concentrations was not attributable to broad geographic region (i.e., provinces) or tail length. For different populations, potential health risk (characterized by hazard quotient or HQ) of MeHg exposure through crayfish consumption depended largely on crayfish consumption rates. In particular, a health hazard (HQ > 1) was found for high-rate consumers (i.e., 95 %ile or higher) in some cities in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River (MLYR), during the peak consumption season. Our results suggest that more attention should be paid to dietary MeHg intake via crayfish consumption in China, particularly for communities with high consumption in MLYR.},

abstract={Freshwater bivalves provide important ecosystem functions and services, yet many of their ecological traits such as feeding mechanisms and resource use are largely ignored. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the potential overlap in resource use by bivalve species living in sympatry in European freshwater ecosystems. This was accomplished by analyzing the stable isotope ratios of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) values of six bivalve species (five native species plus the invasive species Corbicula fluminea) in six distinct aquatic ecosystems. Results showed significant inter- and intraspecific differences in both stable isotope ratios. The interspecific variability suggests differences in the food sources consumed, which can be related to differences in feeding behavior. At the intraspecific level, there was a gradient in the stable isotope ratios from the oligotrophic River Paiva (^sup 15^N-depleted and ^sup 13^C-enriched) to the eutrophic Mira Lagoon (^sup 15^N-enriched and ^sup 13^C-depleted), suggesting a change in the resources used from benthic to pelagic food sources, respectively, and/or differences in the stable isotopic baseline in each ecosystem. Thus, flexible feeding strategies combined with size selectivity may decrease the possible competition for food sources by native and invasive species living in sympatry.},

Seven hundred and six gastropod shells were analysed, representing eight species. These eight species were most abundant and consistently present in the sediment sequence of the Paddenluch outcrop, Brandenburg, northeast Germany. Significant differences between minimum and maximum <ce><b4>^sup 13^C and <ce><b4>^sup 18^O values of the shells were recorded within all sediment samples and for all analysed species. Within the sediment samples, the greatest mean variability in both <ce><b4>^sup 13^C and <ce><b4>^sup 18^O values was found for Hippeutis complanatus, 5.84 and 5.23 [per thousand], respectively. The greatest intra-specific variability in C and O isotope values within individual sediment samples, however, was 10.2 and 6.8 [per thousand], respectively. Significant differences between minimum and maximum <ce><b4>^sup 13^C and <ce><b4>^sup 18^O values of individual mollusc shells within the same sediment sample are probably the result of population isotope variability, variations in species life span, thickness of the sediment sample, sediment accumulation rate, and environmental fluctuations during the time span when the sediment was deposited. Shells were randomly selected to determine the optimum number of shells necessary to obtain stable isotope values that are representative of the mean climate signal, from a 1-cm sample of sediment. For each layer of the Paddenluch sediment sequence, 15 or more shells (N [greater than or equal to] 15) was the required sample size to provide representative isotope values and yield a reliable mean isotope value. Sample sizes with fewer shells displayed more variable mean <ce><b4>^sup 13^C and <ce><b4>^sup 18^O values. Stable isotope composition of the analyzed molluscs was species-specific, with differences in mean <ce><b4>^sup 13^C and <ce><b4>^sup 18^O values of 2.5 and 3 [per thousand], respectively.

Current Hg levels in Abramis brama from German rivers are in the range of 73-346 <c2><b5>g/kg wet weight (2009) and exceed the EQS by a factor of 3.7-17.3. Therefore, it is important to identify the sources of Hg pollution in the aquatic environment and to develop effective strategies for reducing the input into associated river systems. The aim of the present study was to analyze Hg in the urban water cycle of the city of Frankfurt am Main, Germany. Samples were taken from the river Main crosscutting the city and its tributaries. In addition, precipitation, stormwater runoff, effluents of two municipal WWTPs, and stormwater management structures such as combined sewer overflows and stormwater retention basins have been analyzed. Loads of Hg have been determined based on the measured concentrations and a Hg mass balance for the aquatic system was created. A total of 160 water samples were analyzed by cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectroscopy (CVAFS) according to US EPA Method 1631. Results from the mass balance have shown that approximately 5 kg Hg/a enter and 15 kg Hg/a leave the study area of Frankfurt am Main via the river Main. The largest amount of Hg (24.58 kg/a) throughout the urban water cycle of Frankfurt am Main is transported via wastewater. However, municipal WWTPs in Frankfurt am Main have been identified as the largest Hg sink, since 99.7% (24.5 kg/a) of the Hg is shifted from the sewage water and stormwater during treatment into the sewage sludge. Thus, the increase of the Hg load in the river Main from 5 to 15 kg/a has to be attributed to other sources such as 3 industrial WWTPs, groundwater and non-treated stormwater runoff during heavy rain events.},

abstract={Nutrient loads from the Mississippi River watershed are associated with seasonal development of bottom-water hypoxia in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Microbial nitrogen (N) transformations at the sediment-water interface are important in determining system productivity and the development and maintenance of hypoxia. Intact sediment cores were incubated in a continuous-flow system with stable isotope tracers to identify and quantify important N sources (e.g., N fixation), sinks (e.g., denitrification and anammox), and links (e.g., dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium, DNRA). Microbial N sinks on the Louisiana-Texas continental shelf remove up to 68 % of the total N load from the Mississippi River watershed, and up to 29 % of this N removal (mean=11.8<c2><b1>1.7 %) may be due to anammox. The highest N2 production rates and ammonium effluxes were observed at low bottom-water oxygen concentrations, and sediments were a significant source of ammonium to the water column at all times. DNRA and heterotrophic N fixation were not consistent pathways for total sediment N fluxes, but their potential importance to N balance and productivity in the system warrants further study and inclusion in ecosystem models. Physical disturbance from passage of two hurricanes in 2008 resulted in lower N cycling rates and sediment oxygen consumption, with sediment processes migrating into the water column. Denitrification is the dominant N sink in the northern Gulf of Mexico and provides a valuable ecosystem service by mitigating N loads from the Mississippi River watershed, particularly during seasonal bottom-water hypoxia events.},

The construction of the Wolwedans Dam in 1989 reduced baseflow to the estuary by 56%, decreasing the intensity of flushing events and causing t he mouth to breach less often. The aim of t his study was to investigate the flux of inorganic nutrients (NH^sup +^^sub 4^, TOxN [NO^sup -^^sub 3^ + NO^sup -^^sub 2^], SRP) as well as total N and P across the sediment-water interface in the estuary. There have been very few studies on nutrient cycling and benthic pelagic coupling in South African estuaries. This study showed t hat t he sediment had a net efflux of NH^sup +^^sub 4^, SRP, TN and TP while TOx N was taken up or converted to other forms of N. The estuary acted as a source of N and P during both summer and w inter. If the estuary remains closed for a prolonged period (12 months), with an increased organic load present on the bent hos, the associated rates of efflux of N and P would increase. In order to reduce the organic load to the system better flushing met hods or, more importantly, a n increase in base flow, is needed to reduce residence times of water in the estuary.},

title={Molecular characterization of heat-shock protein 90 gene and its expression in Gobiocypris rarus juveniles exposed to pentachlorophenol},
abstract={Heat-shock protein 90 (HSP90) is an abundant and highly conserved molecular chaperone, and it fulfills a housekeeping function in contributing to the folding, maintenance of structural integrity, and proper regulation of a subset of cytosolic proteins. In this study, the full-length 2693-bp cDNA of HSP90 was cloned by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) technique from the liver of rare minnow (Gobiocypris rarus) for the first time, designated as GrHSP90. The complete coding sequence of GrHSP90 is 2181 bp in length, which encodes a polypeptide of 726 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 83.4 kDa and a theoretical isoelectric point of 4.90. Phylogenetic tree analysis indicated that deduced protein GrHSP90 had extensive sequence similarities to other fish HSP90s. Tissue distribution showed that GrHSP90 was constitutively expressed in a wide range of tissues including gill, blood, brain, fin, gonad, heart, intestine, kidney, liver, muscle, spleen, skin, and swim bladder. The highest expression was found in the gonad. Furthermore, significant increase in GrHSP90 mRNA in the liver was observed after exposure to pentachlorophenol [greater than or equal to]8<c2><a0><c2><b5>g/L (p < 0.05). Our results suggest that GrHSP90 is indeed an ortholog of the HSP90 family and may be act as a biomarker to assess the effect of environmental contaminant.},

title={Metabolic responses of the Antarctic fishes Notothenia rossii and Notothenia coriiceps to sewage pollution},
abstract={The present study aimed to assess the sewage effects of the Brazilian Antarctic Station Comandante Ferraz, Admiralty Bay, King George Island, on the hepatic metabolism (energetic, antioxidant, and arginase levels) and levels of plasma constituents of two Antarctic fish species Notothenia rossii and N. coriiceps. The bioassays were conducted under controlled temperature (0<c2><a0><c2><b0>C) and salinity (35 psu), exposing the fish for 96 h, to sewage effluent diluted in seawater to 0.5 % (v/v). Liver homogenates were tested for the specific activities of the enzymes glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), glycogen phosphorylase (GPase), hexokinase, citrate synthase, lactate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase, catalase, and arginase. Plasma levels of glucose, triacylglycerides, cholesterol, total protein, albumin, chloride, magnesium, calcium, and inorganic phosphate were also determined. In N. rossii, the decrease in citrate synthase and the increase in G6Pase and GPase suggested that the sewage effluent activated glycogenolysis and hepatic gluconeogenesis, whereas is N. coriiceps, only G6Pase levels were increased. In N. rossii, sewage effluent induced hypertriglyceridemia without modulating glucose plasma levels, in contrast to N. coriiceps, which developed hypoglycemia without elevating plasma triglyceride levels. The decrease in glutathione reductase levels in N. coriiceps and in superoxide dismutase and catalase in N. rossii suggest that these two species are susceptible to oxidative stress stemming from the production of reactive oxygen species. An increase in magnesium in N. rossii and a decrease in N. coriiceps showed that sewage effluent compromised the control of plasma levels of this cation. Although phylogenetically close, both species of Antarctic fish exhibited different metabolic responses to the sewage effluent, with N. coriiceps showing greater susceptibility to the toxic effects of the pollutants. The present study suggests that the biochemical responses of these two species are potential indicators of metabolic changes caused by sewage effluents.},

title={Anthropogenic land use is associated with N-fixing cyanobacterial dominance in lakes across the continental United States},
abstract={Cyanobacteria cause many water quality problems in lakes worldwide. Although many studies have examined factors that influence the structure of cyanobacterial communities, few have explicitly compared the effects of within-lake conditions (e.g., nutrient concentrations) and watershed parameters (e.g., land use) on a diverse array of cyanobacterial taxa. Here, we analyzed data from the 2007 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Lakes Assessment to quantify how lakeshore anthropogenic land use, nutrient concentrations and ratios, and surface water temperatures predict cyanobacterial biovolume and dominance in 236 naturally-formed lakes spanning the continental U.S. We observed that anthropogenic lakeshore land use was the best predictor for cyanobacterial dominance, whereas in-lake nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations were the best predictors for cyanobacterial biovolume. Our analyses suggest that anthropogenic land use may influence cyanobacterial dominance via means other than increased nutrient concentrations. The sum of agricultural and human-developed lakeshore land use was the best predictor of N-fixing cyanobacterial dominance, but there was no significant relationship between anthropogenic land use and non-N-fixing cyanobacterial dominance. In addition, we observed a total N:P ratio threshold for cyanobacterial dominance in the phytoplankton community (150:1) that was much higher than previously reported ratios. Consequently, management strategies to control cyanobacteria need to account for eco-physiological variation among different cyanobacterial taxa, and should consider nutrients and the other effects of land use to control overall lake cyanobacterial biovolume and cyanobacterial dominance, as the two cyanobacterial metrics may be sensitive to different drivers.},

title={Use of allochthonous resources by zooplankton in reservoirs},
abstract={Aquatic food webs are supported by primary production from within the system (autochthony) as well as organic matter produced outside of and transported into the system (allochthony). Zooplankton use allochthonous resources, especially in systems with high terrestrial loading and moderate to low internal primary production. We hypothesized that due to high terrestrial loads and remnant submerged terrestrial material, allochthonous resource use by zooplankton would be significant in all reservoirs and would decline along an increasing reservoir age gradient. Using hydrogen stable isotopes and a Bayesian mixing model, we estimated the contribution of allochthonous sources to organic matter pools and crustaceous zooplankton biomass for ten reservoirs. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in all systems was dominated by allochthonous sources (posterior distribution median >92% allochthonous), while particulate organic matter (POM) composition varied (2-68% allochthonous) and had a lower allochthonous fraction in older reservoirs. There was no relationship between zooplankton allochthony and reservoir age. Crustaceous zooplankton allochthony varied among systems from 26 to 94%, and Chaoborus allochthony, measured in four reservoirs, was similarly variable (33-94%). Consumer allochthony was higher than POM allochthony in some reservoirs, potentially due to terrestrial DOM pathways being important and/or algal resources being inedible (e.g., cyanobacteria). As with many lakes, in the reservoirs we studied, allochthonous inputs account for a significant fraction of the organic matter of basal consumers.},

abstract={Issue Title: A Snapshot of Research Findings Enabled by Scientific Drilling Recently, the discovery of active microbial life in deep-sea sediments has triggered a rapid development of the field known as the "deep biosphere." Geomicrobiological investigations in lacustrine basins have also shown a substantial microbial impact on lake sediments similar to that described for the marine record. Although only 30 % of the lake sites drilled by the International Continental Drilling Program (ICDP) have included microbial investigations, these lakes cover a relatively wide range of salinities (from 0.15 to 33.8 %), pH (from 6.0 to 9.8) and environmental conditions (from very arid to humid subtropical conditions). Here, we analyze results of very recent ICDP lake sites including subsurface biosphere research from southern Patagonia (Laguna Potrok Aike) to the Levantine area (Dead Sea) as well as the East Anatolian high plateau (Lake Van) and Macedonia (Lake Ohrid). These various settings allow the examination of the impact of contrasting environments on microbial activity and their subsequent role during early diagenesis. Furthermore, they permit the identification of biosignatures of former microbial activity recorded in the sediments as well as investigating the impact of microbes in biogeochemical cycles. One of the general outcomes of these preliminary investigations is data to support the hypothesis that microbes react to climatically driven environmental changes that have a direct impact on their subsurface distribution and diversity. This is clear at conspicuous levels associated with well-known climatic periods such as the Medieval Climatic Anomaly or the Little Ice Age. Although more research is needed, this relationship between prevailing microbial assemblages and different climatic settings appears to dominate the lacustrine sites studied until to date.},

title={Dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) seasonally dominates NO3 ^sup -^ reduction pathways in an anthropogenically impacted sub-tropical coastal lagoon},
abstract={Sediments have an important role in nutrient dynamics by providing sites for denitrification, which, in conjunction with nitrogen (N) fixation and other processes such as dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), can regulate ecosystem N availability. Little Lagoon, Alabama, USA, is affected by anthropogenic perturbations and has N inputs from nitrate (NO3 ^sup -^)-contaminated submarine groundwater discharge. N cycle pathways (N-fixation, denitrification, anammox, and DNRA) and benthic fluxes were measured at three sites over a year to investigate the hypothesis that DNRA, by producing ammonium (NH^sub 4^ ^sup +^) as a dissimilatory end product of NO3 ^sup -^ reduction, was a significant process retaining bioavailable fixed N in Little Lagoon. DNRA was found to be an important NO3 ^sup -^ reduction pathway, especially in the summer months (study average: 52.1 [mu]mol N m^sup -2^ h^sup -1^) compared to denitrification (study average 7.7 [mu]mol N m^sup -2^ h^sup -1^). Sulfidic sediments during the majority of the year interfere with denitrification and result in decreased N loss through denitrification. The conversion of NO3 ^sup -^ to the more biologically preferred form of N, NH^sub 4^ ^sup +^ via DNRA, means that NO3 ^sup -^ reduction has considerable nourishing potential and likely will affect both ecosystem function and services. These results indicate that NO3 ^sup -^ reduction may contribute to, rather than counteract, eutrophication during warm summers in estuaries receiving high N inputs. As estuarine sediments provide a key ecosystem function of N removal, excess anthropogenic N input jeopardizes their ability to effectively remove reactive N in Little Lagoon and likely in other impacted ecosystems.},

title={Transcriptional Responses in Adult Zebrafish (Danio rerio) Exposed to Propranolol and Metoprolol},
abstract={[beta]-adrenergic receptor blockers ([beta]-blockers) are widely detected in the aquatic environment; however, the effects of these pharmaceuticals on aquatic organisms remain uncertain. In this study, adult zebrafish were exposed to two different [beta]-blockers, propranolol and metoprolol, for 96 h. After exposure, the transcriptional responses of genes encoding the [beta]-adrenergic receptor (i.e., adrb1, adrb2a, adrb2b, adrb3a and adrb3b), genes involved in detoxification and the stress response (i.e., hsp70, tap, mt1 and mt2), and genes related to the antioxidant system (i.e., cu/zn-sod, mn-sod, cat and gpx) were examined in the brain, liver and gonad. Our results show that both propranolol and metoprolol exposure changes the mRNA level of [beta]-adrenergic receptors, indicating clear pharmacological target engagement of the [beta]-blockers. The transcription of genes related to antioxidant responses and detoxification process were induced, suggesting that [beta]-blocker exposure can activate the detoxification process and result in oxidative stress in fish. Moreover, the transcriptional responses displayed substantial tissue- and gender-specific effects. Considering the environmental concentrations of propranolol and metoprolol, these results suggest that these pharmaceuticals are unlikely to pose a risk to fish. However, the impacts in prolonged exposure, along with other possible side effects due to [beta]-adrenergic receptor blockade, should be further assessed.},

abstract={Issue Title: Thematic Issue: Glacier fluctuation in northern and High Asia: historical and methods perspective This study investigated environmental influences on inorganic nitrogen exchange at the sediment-water interface and quantified the function of sediment as inorganic nitrogen sink/source in the eastern Chongming tidal flat of the Yangtze Estuary. Intact sediment cores (20-25 cm deep) were collected from the high, middle and low tidal flats of the study area every 2 months from July 2012 to May 2013, and incubated to measure the fluxes of ammonium and nitrate (plus nitrite) across the sediment-water interface via continuous-flow experiments. The incubation experimental results showed that ammonium was mainly released from the sediment into the overlying water, with a flux of -5.91 to 14.44 mmol m^sup -2^ day^sup -1^. In contrast, nitrate was primarily influxed from the overlying water into the sediment, with a flux of -20.09 to 8.72 mmol m^sup -2^ day^sup -1^. In this work, temperature, salinity, sedimentary ammonium and nitrate, and total organic carbon were observed to significantly affect the dynamic exchange of inorganic nitrogen across the sediment-water interface of the study area, via controlling nitrogen transformation processes in sediments. It was also estimated that ca. 2101 t N year^sup -1^ for ammonium was totally released from the sediment to overlying water while ca. 1577 t N year^sup -1^ for nitrate was removed from the water to sediment. The dynamic exchanges of inorganic nitrogen at the sediment-water interface implied that the sediment has important influence on adjusting the levels of ammonium and nitrate in tidal water of the study area.},

However, no statistically reliable differential accumulation pattern emerged with regard to length and weight for trace elements (except for Cd for which significant positive correlations with length were recorded). Trace element concentrations found in crayfish tissues were in the range considered harmful to human health (except for Cd and Cr). Moreover, the As and Pb concentrations, either in sediment or crayfish tissues, are clearly related to intense agricultural activities, with extensive use of fertilizers and pesticides, that significantly affect the levels of these toxic metals in the study area.},

Petroleum hydrocarbon contents in scallops and a suite of enzymes [7-Ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx)] in gills and digestive glands were monitored over 10 days. The results revealed that WSF affected the activity of the four enzymes in the gills and digestive glands. EROD activity in the gills was significantly induced in most individuals of the three test groups, while in the digestive gland it was significantly induced in the low-concentration group within 4 days but was inhibited in the middle- and high-concentration groups on days 1, 4, and 10. AHH activity in the gills of all treatment groups was significantly induced on day 1. In the digestive gland, AHH activity was induced in most individuals from the treatment groups. In all treatment groups, GST activity was significantly inhibited from days 2 to 10 in the gills and was induced after day 4 in the digestive gland. GPx activity in the gills was significantly inhibited throughout the exposure period in all treatment groups. There was no overall significant difference in GPx activity in the digestive gland between the control and treatment groups. Our results also revealed that petroleum hydrocarbon concentrations in the tissues increased linearly with exposure time. EROD activity in the digestive gland and GST and GPx activity in the gill tissue were negatively correlated with petroleum hydrocarbon body burden. These enzymes play important roles in detoxification and can act as potential biomarkers for monitoring petroleum hydrocarbon contaminants in the marine environment.},

title={Does the stoichiometric carbon:phosphorus knife edge apply for predaceous copepods?},
abstract={Recent work has indicated that stoichiometric food quality in terms of the carbon:phosphorus (C:P) ratio affects consumers whether the imbalance involves a deficit or an excess of nutrients; hence, organisms exist on a "stoichiometric knife edge". While previous studies have focused primarily on autotroph-herbivore trophic transfer, nutritional imbalances may also affect the interactions between species at higher trophic levels. Since the foods of carnivores are normally stoichiometrically similar to the body compositions of those carnivores, they may be more severely affected than herbivores if imbalances become pronounced. We analysed the response of the predatory copepod Parabroteas sarsi to monospecific diet treatments consisting of high and low C:P prey items. These dietary treatments strongly affected the predator's elemental composition and growth, although prey selection, excretion, egestion, and respiration rates were not affected. We suggest that, due to their low threshold elemental ratio and a narrow C:P stoichiometric knife edge, these predators are highly vulnerable to stoichiometric imbalances, whether an excess or a deficit of nutrients is involved. Our results demonstrating this high sensitivity to prey C:P ratio show that the stoichiometric knife edge may apply to not only herbivores but also higher trophic levels. Thus, predators such as P. sarsi, with a much narrower range of food quality, may also be strongly affected by fluctuations in the quality of their prey, with negative consequences for their secondary production.},

We exposed C. fluminea in the laboratory to natural and cadmium (Cd)-spiked sediments below flowing water in order to evaluate the organisms' Cd accumulation and metallothionein (MT) response under hydrodynamic conditions. The accumulation of Cd and the induction of MT in C. fluminea were determined at 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 16, and 23 days. Hydrodynamic conditions, represented by a water flow rate of 14 or 3.2 cm/s, increased Cd accumulation in the visceral mass, gill, foot, and mantle of C. fluminea in the first 3 or 6 days in the natural sediment. Cd concentrations in the C. fluminea tissues kept increasing over time in the three treatments, and significant differences were observed in Cd accumulation after 6 (visceral mass), 10 (foot) and 16 (gill and mantle) days among the three groups. The MT concentrations were barely affected by hydrodynamic conditions and were significantly linearly related to the Cd concentration in the visceral mass in the natural sediment and binomially related to it in the Cd-spiked sediment. Hydrodynamic conditions enhanced the accumulation of Cd in the soft tissues of C. fluminea, especially in the Cd-spiked sediment, but stronger hydrodynamic forces did not increase Cd accumulation. MT may be considered an indicator for Cd accumulation in C. fluminea under hydrodynamic conditions, but only when the Cd concentrations in the tissue remain below the toxic threshold values.},

title={Methane gas in lake bottom sediments quantified using acoustic backscatter strength},
abstract={Freshwater lakes and reservoirs can produce substantial quantities of methane (CH4) within bottom sediments. Due to its low solubility in water, CH4 forms bubbles that accumulate within bottom sediments and are released from sediments when buoyant forces exceed viscous, frictional, and inertial forces. Methane ebullition can enhance internal loading of nutrients and hasten release of other sediment-associated contaminants while also exporting a significant amount of C out of the lake basin and delivering a potent greenhouse gas to the atmosphere. The purpose of this study was to evaluate use of hydroacoustic measurements to remotely sense the CH4 content of sediments in lakes. The acoustic signatures of bottom sediments measured using a BioSonics DT-X echosounder at 38, 201, and 430 kHz were compared with gas volumes of surficial sediments determined using a displacement method. Measurements were made on three lakes in southern California, USA that varied in depth, productivity, and other features. The maximum volume backscatter strength of bottom echoes at 201 kHz was highly correlated with gas content (r ^sup 2^=0.93) and, with suitable ground-truthing, can quantify the concentration and spatial distribution of CH4 gas in soft cohesive sediments of lakes and reservoirs. As an application of this technique, the spatial distribution of CH4 within bottom sediments of Lake Elsinore was determined from a hydroacoustic survey conducted in June 2010. Results are also presented from a transect on Lake Hodges demonstrating high levels of CH4 in this eutrophic lake. Hydroacoustic measurements of the maximum volume backscatter strength of soft organic sediments at 201 kHz provide a way to remotely estimate the volume of methane and other gases present in bottom sediments of lakes and reservoirs.},

abstract={The extensive use of pharmaceuticals has resulted in the intensive contamination of water bodies. Tetracycline is a type of antibiotic and its potential toxicity is causing environmental concern. The effects of developmental toxicity and the mechanisms of tetracycline on fish embryos are not well understood. Zebrafish embryos are used in this study to investigate the developmental toxicity of this compound. Four hour post-fertilization (hpf) zebrafish embryos are exposed to different concentrations of tetracycline until 96 hpf. The larvae display developmental delay phenotypes, including hatching delay, shorter body length, increased yolk sac area and uninflated swim bladder upon exposure to tetracycline. Delayed yolk sac absorption and swim bladder deficiency at 96 hpf are observed in the zebrafish larvae upon exposure to 20 [mu]g/L of tetracycline. To test whether tetracycline causes oxidative damage and the resulting oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), Acridine Orange staining and real time polymerase chain reaction have been performed in this study. The results indicate that tetracycline exposure results in significant increases in ROS production and cell apoptosis, mainly in the tail areas at 96 hpf. The gene expression pattern demonstrates that tetracycline induces ROS which causes apoptosis in the zebrafish larvae, and the results also indicate that caspase-dependent apoptotic pathways may greatly contribute to tetracycline-induced apoptosis in the early-life stages of the zebrafish. In addition, we have investigated the effects of tetracycline on marker genes related to resistance mechanisms and gene regulating drug biotransformation. The results of these gene expression studies indicate that tetracycline could induce zebrafish to resist pharmaceuticals and Cytochrome P450s that are involved in the biotransformation of tetracycline in zebrafish larvae. The overall results indicate that tetracycline can produce oxidative stress and induce apoptosis, which brings about significant developmental delay in zebrafish embryos.},

We report a much higher diversity in the genus Bennelongia (Ostracoda) in Western than in eastern Australia. Using mitochondrial COI sequence data for phylogenies, relative age estimates, lineage-through-time plots, and reconstructions of ancestral distributions, we test four hypotheses that might explain the higher diversity and endemicity in Western Australia. (1) We find no evidence for ancient relictualism as most Bennelongia species are probably of Miocene age. (2) There are also no apparent links to vicariant events: speciation has mostly taken place in Western Australia and has been ongoing through the evolutionary history of Bennelongia. (3) Dispersal has apparently not negatively affected Western Australian Bennelongia endemicity although these ostracods produce drought-resistant eggs. We report one case of recent long distance dispersal in B. dedeckkeri with genetically identical populations occurring more than 2,000 km apart. (4) Since speciation has been ongoing, there is no evidence of recent explosive speciation through genetic isolation. The underlying mechanisms of Bennelongia speciation thus remain elusive, although speciation has mostly occurred during a period of increasing aridification of Australia.},

However, growth and photosynthesis in rice seedlings treated with 1,000 or 3,000<c2><a0>[mu]g L^sup -1^ microcystins were still lower than those of the control, even worse than those during the exposure period, indicating an irreversible inhibition of microcystins to plants at high concentrations of microcystins. Our results imply that irrigation with microcystin-contaminated water must be monitored and controlled to avoid harmful accumulation of microcystins and damage to plant growth.},

title={Tissue targeting of the European flat oyster, Ostreaedulis, using microencapsulated microbeads as a biological proxy},
abstract={Expansion of the aquaculture industry has been accompanied by outbreaks of disease from an ever increasing range of pathogens. Such outbreaks pose serious limitations to the growth and sustainability of the seafood industry, necessitating the development of alternative methods to combat disease. Immunostimulants are currently being pursued as an effective alternative to the use of traditional antibiotics. However, for suspension feeding bivalves, an effective system whereby immunostimulants can be successfully delivered to the site of infection at appropriate times is lacking. In recent years, the process of microencapsulation using non-toxic and biodegradable coatings has been an effective and stable delivery system for the administration of probiotics. In this study, SMA microbeads encapsulated in alginate were used as a biological proxy for the delivery of immunostimulants to the European flat oyster, Ostrea edulis. Chitosan- and poly-l-lysine-coated and uncoated alginate microcapsules were used, and the route of intake and transportation to the various oyster tissue types was assessed histologically. Results demonstrated that bivalves readily ingest microalginates, which are broken up in the gut liberating the SMA microbeads. The SMA microbeads successfully cross the digestive epithelium and disperse into the surrounding tissue. The microbeads were also actively taken up by the oyster hemocytes. This study demonstrated that microencapsulation in alginate can serve as an efficient immunostimulant delivery system for bivalves, providing alternative treatment options for effective disease management and control.},

title={Short and long-term exposure to diclofenac alter oxidative stress status in common carp Cyprinus carpio},
abstract={Diclofenac (DCF) has been detected in significant amounts in municipal treated wastewater effluent. Diverse studies report that trace concentrations of DCF may induce toxic effects on different aquatic organisms as well as developmental, reproductive and renal damage. This study aimed to determine whether short and long-term exposure to DCF alter the oxidative stress (OS) status in blood, muscle, gills, brain and liver of common carp Cyprinus carpio. The median lethal concentration of DCF at 96 h (96-h LC^sub 50^) and subsequently the lowest observed adverse effect level were determined. Carp were exposed (short and long-term) to the latter value for different exposure times (4 and 24 days) and the following biomarkers were evaluated in gill, brain, liver and blood: hydroperoxides content (HPC), lipid peroxidation (LPX), protein carbonyl content (PCC) and the activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). Also, the DCF was determined by LC-MS/MS. Significant increases in HPC, LPX and PCC were observed respect to control (P < 0.05) particularly in blood, muscle, gill, brain and liver. SOD, CAT and GPx activity also increased in these organs, with respect to controls (P < 0.05). DCF concentrations decreased and increased in water system and carp, respectively. Cyprinus carpio exposed to DCF was affected in OS status during the initial days of the study (at 4 days), exhibiting an increased response at 24 days in blood and liver. In contrast, a decrease was observed in muscle, gills and brain at 24 days with respect to 4 days. In conclusion, DCF induces OS on blood, muscle, gills, brain and liver in the carp C. carpio in short and long-term exposure. The biomarkers employed in this study are useful in the assessment of the environmental impact of this agent on aquatic species.},

title={Effects of flow regime on growth rate in freshwater drum, Aplodinotus grunniens},
abstract={Understanding the influence of flow regime hydrology on fish life history is essential for conservation and management of lotic ecosystems. The objectives of this study were to investigate growth patterns of Wabash River freshwater drum Aplodinotus grunniens relative to age, sex, and long term flow regime variation. Growth was estimated using back-calculated lengths from otolith measurements. Flow regime was described using Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration flow metrics calculated from long-term stream flow data at USGS stations. A generalized linear mixed model was used to model growth as a function of age, sex, and flow regime. Freshwater drum growth was explained by variation in age, sex, and flow magnitude. Freshwater drum exhibited indeterminate growth relative to age. Mean growth rates and mean length at age were lower in males than females. High magnitude flow events were positively correlated with increased growth rates in both males and females. However, the effect of flow magnitude variation on growth was stronger in males. The primary flow regime metrics related to growth were magnitude-based and were not related to timing of flow events. The study provides evidence that long term variation in flow regime is a catalyst for alterations in freshwater drum growth rates.},

abstract={The capacity and mechanism of Limnoperna fortunei to reduce the concentration of forchlorfenuron [or 1-(2-chloropyridin-4-yl)-3-phenylurea (CPPU)] in water has been studied under laboratory conditions. Firstly, the evasive response of mussels to CPPU (10, 20, 40 and 60 mg L^sup -1^) was evaluated, and a toxicity test was carried out at these concentrations. Secondly, the effect of two different sizes of mussels on CPPU concentrations was investigated in a 24-day experiment. Thirdly, the role of intact mussels and valvae only were respectively evaluated in another 24-day experiment. The CPPU concentration decreased by about 40 % in the presence of large mussels and about 20 % in the presence of valvae only. Finally, nucleic acid extracts from the gut and biofilm microbial communities of L. fortunei were analyzed, and the number of copies of the bacterial genes amoA, nirK and nirS were determined. Based on these results, we propose possible mechanisms for CPPU degradation involving bacteria-associated nitrification and denitrification reactions. In summary, we found that the CPPU half-life depended on the presence of mussels, their size and their associated microorganisms.},

abstract={As major components in antifouling paints, both dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and copper are ubiquitous in estuarine sediment and have been detected at high concentrations in the harbors in South China. In the present study joint toxicity between DDT and copper to an estuarine polychaete, Nereis succinea, was examined using bioaccumulation potential, growth impairment and change in lipid peroxidation contents as sub-lethal endpoints. In general, the toxicity of DDXs (DDT and its metabolites) and copper acted independently and copper was more toxic to the lugworms at environmentally relevant concentrations. Nevertheless, co-exposure to copper led to a significant reduction in the bioaccumulation of DDXs when the concentrations of DDXs in sediment were high. The inhibition of DDX bioaccumulation by copper may be partially explained by the decrease in the bioavailability of sediment-associated DDXs which were estimated by biomimetic gut fluid extraction. The saturation of the solubilization agents or the inhibition of protease activity in gut fluid of N. succinea by copper limited the DDX bioavailability and the subsequent bioaccumulation.},

title={Analytical approaches to support current understanding of exposure, uptake and distributions of engineered nanoparticles by aquatic and terrestrial organisms},
abstract={Initiatives to support the sustainable development of the nanotechnology sector have led to rapid growth in research on the environmental fate, hazards and risk of engineered nanoparticles (ENP). As the field has matured over the last 10 years, a detailed picture of the best methods to track potential forms of exposure, their uptake routes and best methods to identify and track internal fate and distributions following assimilation into organisms has begun to emerge. Here we summarise the current state of the field, focussing particularly on metal and metal oxide ENPs. Studies to date have shown that ENPs undergo a range of physical and chemical transformations in the environment to the extent that exposures to pristine well dispersed materials will occur only rarely in nature. Methods to track assimilation and internal distributions must, therefore, be capable of detecting these modified forms. The uptake mechanisms involved in ENP assimilation may include a range of trans-cellular trafficking and distribution pathways, which can be followed by passage to intracellular compartments. To trace toxicokinetics and distributions, analytical and imaging approaches are available to determine rates, states and forms. When used hierarchically, these tools can map ENP distributions to specific target organs, cell types and organelles, such as endosomes, caveolae and lysosomes and assess speciation states. The first decade of ENP ecotoxicology research, thus, points to an emerging paradigm where exposure is to transformed materials transported into tissues and cells via passive and active pathways within which they can be assimilated and therein identified using a tiered analytical and imaging approach.},

abstract={A pilot-scale study was conducted to evaluate the impact of several biofiltration enhancement strategies in terms of organic removal to reduce disinfection by-product (DBP) formation potential and mitigate ultrafiltration (UF) fouling. Strategies included nutrient addition (nitrogen and phosphorus) to optimize metabolic degradation of organics, use of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, peroxide) to improve filter run times, and the application of in-line aluminum sulphate (alum) for biopolymer removal. The impact of media type on performance was also examined (anthracite versus granular activated carbon (GAC)). Passive biofiltration (without enhancement) reduced dissolved organic carbon (<e2><88><bc>5%), biopolymers (<e2><88><bc>20%), and trihalomethane and haloacetic acid precursors (<e2><88><bc>20% and <e2><88><bc>12%, respectively) while mitigating UF irreversible fouling (<e2><88><bc>60%). Nutrient addition was not observed to enhance biological performance. Addition of 0.5 mg/L hydrogen peroxide decreased head loss by up to 45% without affecting organic removal; however at a dosage of 1 mg/L, it negatively impacted both UF fouling and DBP precursor removal. In-line alum addition prior to biofiltration (<0.5 mg/L) improved UF fouling control by up to 40%, without sacrificing head loss. Overall, GAC provided superior performance when compared to anthracite.},

Both the denitrification and anammox processes were observed to be associated closely with the bioavailability of organic matter and concentrations of sulfide and iron oxides in sediments. Denitrification was the dominant pathway of eliminating reactive nitrogen and on average accounted for about 90 % of the total removed nitrogen. Totally, both the denitrification and anammox processes removed about 20 % of the externally derived inorganic nitrogen within the system. Most of the external nitrogen was still retained in the ecosystem, which may cause the severe eutrophication and algae blooms occurring at the study area.},

The Urias coastal lagoon (SE Gulf of California), a subtropical tidal estuary, receives cooling water releases from a thermoelectric power plant, urban and industrial wastes, and shrimp farm discharges. In order to evaluate the plant thermal impact, we measured synchronous temperature time series close to and far from the plant.

abstract={One of the most widely used carbon nanomaterials is fullerene (C^sub 60^), a lipophilic organic compound that potentially can behave as a carrier of toxic molecules, enhancing the entry of environmental contaminants in specific organs. Microcystins (MC) are cyanotoxins very toxic for human and environmental health. Several studies showed that exposure to MC or C^sub 60^ generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) and changes in antioxidant levels. Also, another factor that can come to enhance the toxic potential of both MC and C^sub 60^ is UVA radiation. Therefore, it was evaluated the effects on oxidative stress parameters of ex vivo co-exposure of MC and C^sub 60^ (5 mg/l) in gills of the fish Cyprinus carpio under UVA radiation incidence. The results showed that (a) there was a loss of antioxidant capacity after low MC concentration (L, 50 [mu]g/l) + C^sub 60^ co-exposure under UVA, (b) C^sub 60^ under UVA decreased glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity, (c) high MC concentration (H, 200 [mu]g/l) + C^sub 60^ co-exposure decreased the concentrations of glutathione (GSH) under UVA or in the dark, (d) L under UVA increased lipid peroxidation, and (e) C^sub 60^ did not cause a higher bioaccumulation of MC in gills. The lowering of GSH in H + C^sub 60^ co-exposure should compromise MC detoxification mediated by GST, although toxin accumulation is not influenced by C^sub 60^.},

abstract={The response of aquatic organisms to flow regulation at hydro facilities has become a key issue for the development of sustainable management practices intending to reduce the impact in regulated rivers. In previous studies, unrestricted ramping rates have been found to have a negative effect on invertebrate communities and shortened the length of the food web. The decrease in the length of the food web was inferred from a significant decrease in the difference between macroinvertebrates and fish <ce><b4>^sup 13^N signatures, equivalent to the loss of the one trophic level. A before-after-control-impact (BACI) design was applied to determine the possible effects of ramping rate restrictions on the diet of small-bodied fishes in a boreal river in northern Ontario. Stomach contents were identified to the taxonomic level of order. Using these data, abundance, diversity and taxa composition were calculated to yield an understanding of the alterations that occurred in the food web, and how fish species diets may have changed to compensate for the shift in the invertebrate trophic level. It was found that unrestricted ramping rates were associated with an increase in invertebrate abundance within the stomach contents. There was no effect from the change to unlimited ramping for both stomach content EPT abundance and species diversity, as both rivers followed a similar trend over time. After unrestricted ramping rates, a greater frequency of baseline taxa and a lower frequency of predatory macroinvertebrates were found within the altered river stomach contents compared to what was expected. This demonstrates that the diets of small-bodied fishes have changed to compensate for the alterations to the food web due to unrestricted ramping rates, and implies that ramping rates should be taken into consideration in the regulation of operating regimes on altered rivers.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Silver is one of the most toxic metals to freshwater aquatic organisms. Limited efforts have been made to study apoptosis and genotoxic potential of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in freshwater snail Lymnea luteola L. (L. luteola). Therefore, the present investigation was aimed to study the induction of apoptosis and DNA damage by AgNPs in L. luteola. AgNPs showed molluscicidal activity against L. luteola and three concentrations of AgNPs were selected, the concentration I (4 [mu]g/l), concentration II (12 [mu]g/l), and the concentration III (24 [mu]g/l). Induction of oxidative stress in snail hemolymph was observed by a decrease in reduced glutathione (GSH) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) levels at different concentration of AgNPs, and on the other hand, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels increased at lower concentrations but decreased in higher concentration of AgNPs. Catalase (CAT) activity was also decreased at lower concentrations and increased in higher concentration of AgNPs. Flow cytometry data showed that AgNPs exposed hemocyte cells promote apoptotic and necrotic-mediated cell death when AgNPs concentrations were 12 and 24 [mu]g/l compared to control. DNA damage scores increased with the exposure levels of AgNPs, and dose- and time-dependent effects were observed. A significant positive correlation was observed among reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, apoptosis, and DNA damage. The study suggests that ROS may be involved in inducing apoptosis and DNA damage in the AgNPs exposed hemocyte cells of L. luteola. This study demonstrates that AgNPs is lethal to freshwater snail L. luteola.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Escape performance of temperate king scallop, Pecten maximus under ocean warming and acidification},
abstract={Among bivalves, scallops are exceptional due to their capacity to escape from predators by swimming which is provided by rapid and strong claps that are produced by the phasic muscle interspersed with tonic muscle contractions. Based on the concept of oxygen and capacity-limited thermal tolerance, the following hypothesis was tested: ocean warming and acidification (OWA) would induce disturbances in aerobic metabolic scope and extracellular acid-case status and impair swimming performance in temperate scallops. Following long-term incubation under near-future OWA scenarios [20 vs. 10<c2><a0><c2><b0>C (control) and 0.112 kPa CO2 (hypercapnia) vs. 0.040 kPa CO2 (normocapnic control)], the clapping performance and metabolic rates (MR) were measured in resting (RMR) and fatigued (maximum MR) king scallops, Pecten maximus, from Roscoff, France. Exposure to OA, either alone or combined with warming, left MR and swimming parameters such as the total number of claps and clapping forces virtually unchanged. Only the duration of the escape response was affected by OA which caused earlier exhaustion in hyper- than in normocapnic scallops at 10<c2><a0><c2><b0>C. While maximum MR was unaffected, warm exposure increased RMR in both normocapnic and hypercapnic P. maximus resulting in similar Q ^sub 10^ values of ~2.2. The increased costs of maintenance and the observation of strongly reduced haemolymph PO2 levels indicate that at 20<c2><a0><c2><b0>C scallops have reached the upper thermal pejus range with unbalanced capacities for aerobic energy metabolism. As a consequence, warming to 20<c2><a0><c2><b0>C decreased mean phasic force during escape performance until fatigue. The observed prolonged recovery time in warm incubated scallops might be a consequence of elevated metabolic costs at reduced oxygen availability in the warmth.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Surface properties affect the attachment of micro- and macroscopic marine organisms. The current study examined the settlement response of the mussel Mytilus coruscus plantigrades to natural biofilms formed on surfaces of different wettability. The percentages of plantigrade settlement were not influenced by the biofilms formed on variously wettable surfaces in the short term, but after 10 days, the plantigrade settlement rates decreased on biofilms formed on lower wettability surfaces. In general, lower wettability of the surfaces resulted in the decrease of the dry weight, bacterial and diatom density and the thickness of natural biofilms when compared to high wettability surfaces. In contrast, chlorophyll-a concentration in biofilms was independent of the initial wettability of the surfaces. Comparative cluster analysis of bacterial denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis patterns revealed that high variability existed between the bacterial community on high wettability surfaces and that on low wettability surfaces. Thus, surface wettability affects the formation of natural biofilms, and this variation in biofilms developed on different wettability surfaces may explain the discrepancy in their corresponding inducing activities on M. coruscus plantigrade settlement. This finding provides new insight into interactions between mussel settlement, biofilm characteristics and surface properties.},

Relative clearance rates of phytoplankton were assessed for chlorophyll a size-fractions and for different groups of nanoplanktonic and microplanktonic protists. The two locations showed significant differences in plankton community structure. Nanoeukaryotes were the dominant group at both locations; the second most-abundant groups were diatoms at MC and ciliates at LT. Significant differences in clearance for different components of the community suggest that F. enigmaticus has the potential to promote changes in plankton community structure and, hence, exerts strong top-down controls.},

abstract={To study the relationship between zooplankton community structure and environmental factors and water quality in the Harbin Section of the Songhua River, investigations were carried out in June, August, and October 2011. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and saprobic indices were used to process and analyze the data. Seasonal variability was identified as a significant source of variation, which explains the fluctuation in zooplankton density. In autumn, the dry season, water residence time increased and zooplankton biomass and abundance accumulated in the slow flowing waters. Zooplankton abundance increased when food conditions improved. Therefore, the total zooplankton abundance in autumn is much higher than that in spring and summer. According to the saprobic indices, all the sample sites had mesosaprobic water and water quality was worse in autumn. CCA revealed that temperature accounted for most of the spatial variation in the zooplankton community. Moreover, pH, dissolved oxygen saturation, and turbidity were important factors affecting zooplankton community distribution.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

A sensitivity analysis is performed to review the proper range of parameters for the proposed model, while the applicability and reproducibility are reviewed in comparison to the EFDC model. As a result, the proposed model showed better results than the EFDC model for the hydraulic analysis, while the predicted water quality results were comparable to the two models, although the proposed model showed a high applicability due to its short simulation time.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

We selected the following bioassays: the algal growth inhibition test (Skeletonema marinoi and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata), the microcrustacean immobilization test (Artemia salina and Daphnia magna), development and adult survival tests on Hydra attenuata, embryotoxicity and metamorphosis tests on Crassostrea gigas, and in vitro assays on primary cultures of Haliotis tuberculata hemocytes. The results showed high inter-species variability in EC^sub 50^-values ranging from 43 to 15,600<c2><a0><c2><b5>g/L for fluoxetine, from 67 to 4,400<c2><a0><c2><b5>g/L for sertraline, and from 4.70<c2><a0><c2><b5>g/L to more than 100,000<c2><a0><c2><b5>g/L for clomipramine. Algae (S. marinoi and P. subcapitata) and the embryo-larval stages of the oyster C. gigas were the most sensitive taxa. This raises an issue due to their ecological and/or economic importance. The marine crustacean A. salina was the least sensitive species. This difference in sensitivity between bioassays highlights the importance of using a test battery.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Evolution of ancient lake bivalves: the Lymnocardiinae (Cardiidae) of the Caspian Sea},
abstract={Issue Title: Speciation in Ancient Lakes - Classic Concepts and New Approaches The Caspian Sea as the largest continental water body in the world is known for its comparably high levels of biodiversity and endemism, also in mollusks. The evolution of a euryhaline taxon of cardiid bivalves, the Lymnocardiinae of the Ponto-Caspian region, remains unclear today. We studied material from the whole recent range of Lymnocardiinae (i.e., the Caspian, the Azov, and the Black Seas) using a LSU rDNA phylogeny aiming at (a) testing the monophyly of Lymnocardiinae and (b) determining the phylogenetic relationships within Cardiidae. Lymnocardiinae s.str. were monophyletic, i.e., a distinct group that included species of Hypanis, Didacna, and Monodacna. Lymnocardiinae as often understood, i.e., including Cerastoderma, are not monophyletic in our analysis and Cerastoderma should thus be transferred to Cardiinae. The Lymnocardiinae s.str. had a shallow tree topology and were poorly resolved. No clearcut biogeographical pattern could be derived from the phylogeny, i.e., species stemming from respective Ponto-Caspian regions, do not necessarily cluster together. We discuss a scenario of the evolutionary history and biogeographical (as well as taxonomic) implications. Given the complex history of the Ponto-Caspian region and the Caspian Sea in particular, the Lymnocardiinae would represent an interesting study object for addressing the consequences of environmental changes on biotic evolution at various spatial and temporal scales.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={This paper seeks to identify the biomarker response to oxidative stress in Astyanax bimaculatus, a freshwater fish, collected from the Una River and its associated water bodies. The fish were collected using fishing nets at three different points on the river basin, namely Fazenda Piloto (FP), Ipiranga (IP) and Rem<c3><a9>dios (RM), during the period from December 2013 to March 2014. Physical and chemical analyses of the water at the sample locations indicate that IP and RM possibly have larger concentration of either natural or anthropic pollutants as compared to FP. FP can therefore be considered as the point less impacted by pollutants than other points. Hepatic activity of antioxidant stress enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), were measured in the specimens. The levels of SOD were reduced at RM while they were elevated in fish collected at IP. The CAT levels for the fish at RM and IP were about 148.9% and 202.4% above the values at FP, respectively. These results suggest that antioxidant enzymes could be used as biomarkers to measure oxidative stress caused by pollutants in the Una River Basin.},

The objective of this study was to assess whether total carotenoid content (TCC) in H. cumingii is related to shell color. TCC of different tissues (gonad, gill, hepatopancreas, kidney, axe foot, mantle, and adductor muscle) of purple and white inner-shell H. cumingii was determined by UV-Vis spectrophotometry. The results revealed that TCC ranged from 12.91 <c2><b1> 0.78 to 56.30 <c2><b1> 0.74 [mu]g/g. In general, TCC was higher in the hepatopancreas, followed by the mantle, gonad, gill, kidney, axe foot, and adductor muscle. TCC in gonad, gill, hepatopancreas, kidney, and mantle of purple mussels was significantly higher than that of white mussels. TCC in mussel tissues of H. cumingii was significantly different (P < 0.001) with respect to shell color. There were significant positive correlations between TCC in mussel mantle and shell color intensity. Future studies will assess the biological roles of carotenoids in shell color formation.

abstract={Metal levels in fish have been extensively studied, but little data currently exists for the Middle East. We examined the levels of metals and metalloids (aluminum, arsenic, copper, manganese, selenium, zinc, and mercury) in the flesh of 13 fish species collected from three fishing sites and a local fish market in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. We tested the following null hypotheses: (1) there are no interspecific differences in metal levels, (2) there are no differences in metal levels in fishes between market and fishing sites, (3) there are no size-related differences in metal levels, and (4) there are no differences in selenium:mercury molar ratio among different fish species. There were significant interspecific differences in concentrations for all metals. There was an order of magnitude difference in the levels of aluminum, arsenic, mercury, manganese, and selenium, indicating wide variation in potential effects on the fish themselves and on their predators. Fishes from Area II, close to a large commercial port, had the highest levels of arsenic, mercury, and selenium, followed by market fishes. Mercury was positively correlated with body size in 6 of the 13 fish species examined. Mercury was correlated positively with arsenic and selenium, but negatively with aluminum, cobalt, copper, manganese, and zinc. Selenium:mercury molar ratios varied significantly among species, with Carangoides bajad, Cephalopholis argus, Variola louti, and Ephinephelus tauvina having ratios below 10:1. These findings can be used in risk assessments, design of mercury reduction plans, development of fish advisories to protect public health, and future management decision-making.},

title={Biogeography of freshwater fishes of the Balkan Peninsula},
abstract={Delineating biogeographical regions is a critical step towards the establishment and evaluation of conservation priorities. In the present study, we analysed the distribution patterns of the freshwater fish of an understudied European biodiversity hotspot, the Balkan Peninsula. Based on the most extensive available database of native freshwater fish species distributions, we performed a hierarchical clustering analysis to identify the major biogeographical regions of the Balkan Peninsula. We also highlighted the 'hottest hotspots' of freshwater fish diversity across the delimited biogeographical regions by describing the patterns of species richness, endemic and vulnerable species; indicator species were also determined. The bioregionalisation scheme consisted of eight groups of drainage basins that correspond to distinct regions of the Balkan Peninsula. Overall, the delineated biogeographical regions varied in terms of species richness, endemism, vulnerability (i.e. extinction threats) and indicator species composition. From a conservation perspective, this study emphasises the prioritisation of areas characterised by high levels of irreplaceability (endemism) and vulnerability (i.e. the Attikobeotia region, Ionian Sea and Prespa Lakes) and stresses the necessity of implementing a network of protected freshwater areas across the Balkan Peninsula.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={A traditional method of enumerating Clostridium perfringens using membrane filtration (MF) as an indicator of fecal contamination was compared to recently developed rapid method using Rapid Fung Double Tube (RFDT) in an evaluation to characterize the extent of sewage contamination in sediments of the Great Lakes. Evaluation of these two methods included determining C. perfringens concentrations and recovery efficiencies from sewage, sewage-spiked sediments, and water (surface and bottom) and sediment samples collected from two Great Lakes. The RFDT method proved to be a superior method for identifying C. perfringens in lake sediments compared to MF, as it had higher recovery efficiency and was more rapid, reliable, simple, and effective. This study provides biological evidence of the long-term deposition and movement of sewage particulates in the Great Lakes environment and demonstrates the potential usefulness of C. perfringens as a tracer for sewage contamination using a reliable enumeration method.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Issue Title: Biology and Conservation of Freshwater Bivalves Based on literature review and malacological collections, 168 native freshwater bivalve and five invasive species have been recorded for 52 hydrographic regions in South America. The higher species richness has been detected in the South Atlantic, Uruguay, Paraguay, and Amazon Brazilian hydrographic regions. Presence or absence data were analysed by Principal Coordinate for Phylogeny-Weighted. The lineage Veneroida was more representative in hydrographic regions that are poorer in species and located West of South America. The Mycetopodidae and Hyriidae lineages were predominant in regions that are richest in species toward the East of the continent. The distribution of invasive species Limnoperna fortunei is not related to species richness in different hydrographic regions there. The species richness and its distribution patterns are closely associated with the geological history of the continent. The hydrographic regions present distinct phylogenetic and species composition regardless of the level of richness. Therefore, not only should the richness be considered to be a criterion for prioritizing areas for conservation, but also the phylogenetic diversity of communities engaged in services and functional aspects relevant to ecosystem maintenance. A plan to the management of this fauna according to particular ecological characteristics and human uses of hydrographic regions is needed.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Acid volatile sulfide (AVS) has been regarded as an important factor controlling metal bioavailability in anoxic sediments, but its effect on metal accumulation under natural conditions is poorly understood. Here, a field study of the influence of AVS on metal accumulation by Limnodrilus sp. in a heavily polluted river is provided. Most of the study area was subject to anaerobic and strongly reducing conditions, and the concentration of trace metals in surface sediments was high, as were the concentration of AVS and simultaneously extracted metals (SEM; average AVS=20.3<c2><a0>[mu]mol g^sup -1^, average <e2><88><91>SEM^sub 5^=9.42<c2><a0>[mu]mol g^sup -1^; <e2><88><91>SEM^sub 5^ refers to the sum of SEM^sub Cd^, SEM^sub Cu^, SEM^sub Pb^, SEM^sub Ni^, and SEM^sub Zn^). Only a few species and small quantities of benthic invertebrates were found, and Limnodrilus sp. was dominant. There was no correlation between trace metal accumulation and (SEM-AVS), and in stations where (SEM-AVS) <0, the absolute value of bioaccumulation was high (average <e2><88><91>BIO^sub 5^=4.07<c2><a0>[mu]mol g^sup -1^; <e2><88><91>BIO^sub 5^ refers to the sum of BIO^sub Cd^, BIO^sub Cu^, BIO^sub Pb^, BIO^sub Ni^, and BIO^sub Zn^), indicating that there was no relationship between (SEM-AVS) and metal accumulation in Limnodrilus sp. This was likely because Limnodrilus sp. ingest sediment particles as their main food source, so pore water metals play a minor role in their bioaccumulation (BIO) of materials. However, <e2><88><91>BIO^sub 5^ was significantly correlated with <e2><88><91>SEM^sub 5^ (r=0.795, p<0.01), revealing that the large number of sulfide-bound metals (SEM) in sediments may play an important role in metal accumulation in Limnodrilus sp., which can assimilate sulfide-associated metals by the help of the digestive fluids in the digestive systems.

title={Identification of factors constraining nitrate assimilation in Lake Superior, Laurentian Great Lakes},
abstract={Issue Title: European Large Lakes III. Large lakes under changing environmental conditions Despite a well-documented rise in nitrate concentration over the past century, Lake Superior has retained an oligotrophic character. In part, this status results from physical attributes of the lake including low temperatures and prolonged isothermy, resulting in deep-mixing and light limitation which constrain primary production. Lake Superior is also phosphorus deficient which limits phytoplankton growth. We conducted large (20 l) volume factorial bioassay experiments to assess the influence of light and nutrients (P, Fe) on nitrate assimilation by a Lake Superior chlorophyte alga. Bioassays seeded with the chlorophyte yielded a strong response to light resulting in the rapid depletion of nitrate. High light resulted in higher activities of the key N-assimilation enzyme nitrate reductase (NR) and increased algal biomass compared to low light treatments. NR activity was highly correlated with rates of nitrate incorporation in bioassays and field surveys suggesting that NR occupies a critical place in nitrate metabolism. In bioassays, the addition of nutrients (P, Fe) only slightly increased the rate at which nitrate became depleted. Parallel trials using a luminescent cyanobacterial bioreporter confirmed the lack of response by added nutrients supporting light as an important factor in constraining nitrate assimilation by phytoplankton in the lake.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

R. China) was analyzed for semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) and the results were used for a potential health impact assessment and genotoxicity test with the microalgae Euglena gracilis. The SVOCs were tested using USEPA Method 525.2, and the health risk assessment was conducted at a screening level using the hazard quotient (HQ) approach. Alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay) was used to evaluate DNA damage and determine the genotoxicity of the source water. The concentrations of the SVOCs in Liuxihe Reservoir were very low and phthalic acid esters were the main SVOCs present. The mean HQ values of pollutants were all less than one, indicating no risk. However, the lifetime carcinogenic risks (LCRs) were found to be close to the threshold of 1.00E-5. The results show that the water in the Liuxihe Reservoir might pose a potential carcinogenic risk to local residents. The highly concentrated extracts of the water samples could induce DNA damage in the microalgal cells and a dose-effect relationship was identified. These results showed that Liuxihe Reservoir water, as a source of drinking water, could pose a potential LCR to local consumers.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Issue Title: Special Issue: Assessment of Ecosystem Health and Ecotoxicology Through Chemical Analysis and Modeling; Editor: Ji-Dong Gu Estuaries are under great anthropogenic pressure. The presence of contaminants such as trace metals, organics and organometallics in the Haihe basin, Baohai Bay China indicates a deterioration of environmental quality. In this study the ecological status of three estuaries in Haihe basin was evaluated in relation to the presence of trace metals. An integrated biomarker response index (IBR) method was applied that combined biomarker responses in natural periphyton present on surface sediment with general "stress index". Sediment samples were collected at 11 sites throughout three estuaries of Haihe basin (Luanhe, Haihe and Zhangweixin) during three seasons. The IBR values indicated that the temporal variation of biological status was autumn (3.35) < spring (3.38) < summer (4.07) (The higher the value, the worse the biological status), while the spatial variation was Zhangweixin (0.73) < Luanhe (3.31) < Haihe (6.96) in spring and autumn, and Luanhe (1.79) < Zhangweixin (3.64) < Haihe (7.69) in summer. The risk quotients of trace metals in sediment samples were calculated based on the corresponding Effects Rang Low values. The temporal variation of risk quotients was autumn (10.76) < spring (11.78) < summer (15.99), while the estuarine variation was Luanhe (8.47) < Zhangweixin (12.29) < Haihe (19.42). The IBR values and risk quotients were fitted into cubic regression equations. It is proven that the good assessment of periphyton integrated biomarker responses to biological status and contaminated risk in estuarine zones.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Large differences in <ce><b4> ^sup 2^H of primary producers between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems are used to identify subsidies, discriminate organic matter sources, and reduce uncertainty in food web studies. Previous investigations of hydrogen isotope ratios suggest there may be predictable differences between the <ce><b4> ^sup 2^H of water and organic matter for different types of primary producers. We define the difference in the net isotopic discrimination between water and bulk organic matter (om) as: [Delta]^sub H^ = (<ce><b4> ^sup 2^H^sub om^ - <ce><b4> ^sup 2^H^sub water^)<c2><a0><c3><b7><c2><a0>(1 + <ce><b4> ^sup 2^H^sub water^ <c3><b7> 1,000). We summarized [Delta]^sub H^ values from published literature and we measured the <ce><b4> ^sup 2^H of water and primary producers in order to compare [Delta]^sub H^ among aquatic and terrestrial primary producers. Measurements were made from three water body types (lake, river, coastal lagoon) and their associated watersheds. Although we predicted a large and equivalent net isotopic discrimination for aquatic primary producers, we found considerable variability among groups of aquatic producers. Macroalgae, benthic microalgae, and phytoplankton had more negative [Delta]^sub H^ values (i.e. greater isotopic discrimination) than both aquatic macrophytes and terrestrial vegetation. The more positive <ce><b4> ^sup 2^H^sub om^ and hence lower [Delta]^sub H^ of terrestrial vegetation was expected due to relative increases in the heavier isotope, deuterium, during transpiration. However, the more positive values of <ce><b4> ^sup 2^H^sub om^ and relatively low [Delta]^sub H^ in aquatic macrophytes, even submerged species, was unexpected. Marine macroalgae had high variability in <ce><b4> ^sup 2^H^sub om^ as a group, but low variability within distinct species. Variability among types of primary producers in <ce><b4> ^sup 2^H^sub om^ and in [Delta]^sub H^ should be assessed when hydrogen is used in isotopic studies of food webs.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Estuaries are major pathways for silica fluxes towards the ocean and considered to be a sink for dissolved silica (DSi). However, the data basis for DSi, but also biogenic silica (BSi) fluxes through estuaries is relatively thin. To test the hypothesis, a silica budget for the inner Elbe Estuary was constructed, based on 18 cruises between 2009-2011 and historical monitoring data. A strong positive correlation between particulate organic carbon (POC) and BSi concentration was identified, allowing the reconstruction of historical BSi time series from POC monitoring data. The budget revealed that the Elbe Estuary is a source for DSi and a strong sink for BSi, contradicting the general assumption of estuaries being a sink for DSi. The Elbe River delivered 2.8<c2><a0><c3><97><c2><a0>10^sup 9^ mol DSi a^sup -1^ and 0.9<c2><a0><c3><97><c2><a0>10^sup 9^ mol BSi a^sup -1^ to the estuary. There, 17 % of DSi were added along the inner estuary and 88 % of BSi were lost. Estuarine tributaries represented the largest source of additional DSi to the estuarine waters, while sedimentation was the single largest sink for BSi. It was calculated that large amounts of BSi were removed permanently from the estuarine cycle by sediment dredging. As data on Si transformation in estuaries are scarce and widely underrepresented in global budgets, findings from this study are a valuable contribution, especially since the Elbe Estuary seemed to act contradictory to observed systems so far.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={A mesocosm experiment was conducted to study the effects of bioturbation by the marine bivalve Cyclina sinensis in an aquatic system and to examine how the bioactivities of this clam alter the rate at which nutrients are exchanged across the sediment-water interface. A dark incubation experiment was performed to determine the fluxes of inorganic nutrients (NH^sub 4^ ^sup +^, NO3 ^sup -^ + NO2 ^sup -^ and PO^sub 4^ ^sup 3-^), benthic chlorophyll a (Chl a), organic matter and sediment oxygen consumption (SOC) on days 1, 10, 20 and 30. C. sinensis destroyed the initial sediment surface and partially enhanced oxygen penetration into the sediment. The clam also increased the water content and volume of the oxic sediment. The analysis showed that increases in the clam density and time period produced higher fluxes of all the nutrients (NH^sub 4^ ^sup +^, NO3 ^sup -^ + NO2 ^sup -^ and PO^sub 4^ ^sup 3-^) in the bioturbated chambers compared with the control (non-bioturbated chambers). The concentration of Chl a in the sediment increased significantly at the end of the experiment (day 30) (p < 0.05). The SOC rate increased significantly with the increase in density and with the time period from day 10 to day 30 (p < 0.05). As a result, the fluxes of nutrients increased with increased SOC, producing oxygen-induced sediment mineralization. Our findings suggest that the activities of the clams could positively influence SOC and cause an increase in the fluxes of inorganic nutrients. These effects may substantially improve the primary productivity and water quality of earthen pond ecosystems.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Impacts of Climate-Related Drivers on the Benthic Nutrient Filter in a Shallow Photic Estuary},
abstract={Issue Title: Special Issue: Drivers of Change in Shallow Coastal Photic Systems Guest Editors: Michael J. Kennish, Mark J. Brush, and Kenneth A. Moore In shallow photic systems, the benthic filter, including microphytobenthos and denitrifiers, is important in preventing or reducing release of remineralized NH^sub 4^ ^sup +^ to the water column. Its effectiveness can be impacted by climate-related drivers, including temperature and storminess, which by increasing wind and freshwater delivery can resuspend sediment, reduce salinity and deliver nutrients, total suspended solids, and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) to coastal systems. Increases in temperature and freshwater delivery may initiate a cascade of responses affecting benthic metabolism with impacts on sediment properties, which in turn regulate nitrogen cycling processes that either sequester (via microphytobenthos), remove (via denitrification), or increase sediment nitrogen (via remineralization, nitrogen fixation, and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium). We conducted a seasonal study at shallow stations to assess the effects of freshwater inflow, temperature, wind, light, and CDOM on sediment properties, benthic metabolism, nitrogen cycling processes, and the effectiveness of the benthic filter. We also conducted a depth study to constrain seasonally varying parameters such as temperature to better assess the effects of light availability and water depth on benthic processes. Based on relationships observed between climatic drivers and response variables, we predict a reduction in the effectiveness of the benthic filter over the long term with feedbacks that will increase effluxes of N to the water column with the potential to contribute to system eutrophication. This may push shallow systems past a tipping point where trophic status moves from net autotrophy toward net heterotrophy, with new baselines characterized by degraded water quality.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={The temporal and spatial distributions of zooplankton communities in the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Xin'anjiang Reservoir, Zhejiang, China, were investigated monthly, between 2009 and 2010. Silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and bighead carp (Aristichthys nobilis) dominated the pelagic fish community of this large, deep reservoir. Cladocerans were distributed evenly throughout the reservoir. Rotifers were mainly found in the upper reaches, while copepods tended to assemble in the lower reaches. The Pearson correlation analysis and stepwise multiple regression were used to identify the major physicochemical gradients influencing community variations. Zooplankton community distributions were influenced by water temperature, dissolved oxygen, phosphorus, nitrogen, and silicon. Excess nutrients, in particular silicon, stimulated rotifer growth. Based on these findings, it is possible to use rotifer density as a bioindicator of eutrophic status in deep reservoir ecosystems.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={This research examined the application of the maximum quantum efficiency (F ^sub v^/F ^sub m^) and relative electron transport rate versus irradiance curves (rETR) as a rapid, sensitive assessment of Lake Erie phytoplankton nutrient status. I evaluated the potential benefits of the variable fluorescence parameters by comparing these parameters with chemical and physiological nutrient status assays. I tested the hypothesis that F ^sub v^/F ^sub m^ and rETR curves could diagnose nutrient status in natural lake phytoplankton and be capable of discriminating which inorganic nutrient is limited temporally and spatially. F ^sub v^/F ^sub m^ was on average highest in the more eutrophic west basin (WB) and lowest in the more oligotrophic central basin (CB). According to the chemical and physiological indicators, P deficiency was most severe in the CB during summer stratification and N deficiency was strongest in the WB during isothermal conditions. Like F ^sub v^/F ^sub m^, rETR at light saturation (rETR^sub max^) and the initial slope of the rETR versus irradiance curve ([alpha]) decreased as the severity of N and P deficiency increased. Amendment with N or P stimulated increased F ^sub v^/F ^sub m^, rETR^sub max^, and [alpha] in N- and P-limited samples, respectively, and abolished the photoinhibition apparent in rETR curves of nutrient-limited samples. These results supported the view that the N and P deficiency assays, and corresponding variations of variable fluorescence parameters, were valid indicators of widely variable N and P deficiency in the phytoplankton, and could be used to provide a promising tool in determining phytoplankton nutrient status. Contrary to my hopes, it did not appear that rETR-irradiance curves could discriminate between N and P deficiency. Identification of the most limiting nutrient still demanded additional information beyond the variable fluorescence measurements.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Field observations and laboratory experiments have shown that most of the toxins produced by Dinophysis are released into the medium, raising questions about the ecological role of extracelular toxins and their potential uptake by shellfish. Shellfish contamination results from a complex balance between food selection, adsorption, species-specific enzymatic transformations, and allometric processes. Highest risk areas are those combining Dinophysis strains with high cell content of okadaates, aquaculture with predominance of mytilids (good accumulators of toxins), and consumers who frequently include mussels in their diet. Regions including pectenotoxins in their regulated phycotoxins will suffer from much longer harvesting bans and from disloyal competition with production areas where these toxins have been deregulated.},

title={Saline rivers provide arid landscapes with a considerable amount of biochemically valuable production of chironomid (Diptera) larvae},
abstract={Saline rivers are supposed to be 'hot spots' of high biological productivity in arid landscapes. To test this, we quantified the production of chironomid larvae, because river production is known to be transferred to arid landscapes primarily by birds fed on these larvae. In addition, we studied the potential biochemical quality of the larvae for birds based on the essential highly unsaturated fatty acid (HUFA) contents in their biomass. We studied species composition and measured production of chironomid larvae in two saline rivers (Volgograd region, Russia). We also evaluated the fatty acid composition and contents of the dominant taxa and estimated the flux of HUFA from the studied saline rivers to land via chironomid potential emergence. Average monthly production of chironomids measured for only 1 month, August, was quite comparable to annual production in some freshwater rivers. All the dominant chironomid larvae had comparatively high essential eicosapentaenoic acid contents, especially Cricotopus salinophilus, which showed the highest value, reported for Chironomidae. The monthly flux of HUFA from the studied rivers to land due to the chironomid potential emergence was roughly comparable to the global average estimation of annual water-land HUFA export via emerging insects.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Sex-specific plasticity in body phosphorus content of Hyalella amphipods},
abstract={Understanding the evolution of sexually dimorphic traits requires knowledge of the genetic and environmental sources of variation. However, we know surprisingly little about how the sexes differ in their responses to environmental nutrient supply. Here, we investigated how phosphorus (P) availability, a key metric of eutrophication, affects body composition in each sex of two Hyalella amphipod species. We also examined whether differences in food preference and acquisition are responsible for observed variation in body P. We discovered environmentally-driven changes in body P that were dependent on both species and sex. In both species, males contained less P when raised in low-P laboratory conditions compared to high-P field environments, while females exhibited no significant differences. Importantly, this difference was greater in the species that is known to have larger sexual traits and higher growth rates. Variation in P content was not due to differences in acquisition of P because both sexes preferred high-P food and consumed it at a similar rate. Our study illuminates potentially important sex- and species-specific evolutionary consequences of rapid alterations to P availability due to cultural eutrophication.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Improving water quality communications at beaches: input from stakeholders},
abstract={Objectives: Water quality communication practices vary widely and stakeholder input has not played a role in defining acceptable levels of risk. Although the 2012 Recreational Water Quality Criteria (RWQC) emphasize the importance of promptly notifying the public about hazardous conditions, little is known about the public's understanding of notifications, or about levels of risk deemed acceptable. We sought to address these gaps. Methods: A mixed methods approach was used. Focus groups (FGs) provided qualitative data regarding the understanding of surface water quality, awareness, and use, of currently available water quality information, and acceptability of risk. Intercept interviews (INTs) at recreation sites provided quantitative data. Results: INTs of 374 people and 15 FG sessions were conducted. Participants had limited awareness about water quality information posted at beaches, even during swim bans and advisories. Participants indicated that communication content should be current, from a trusted source, and describe health consequences. Communicating via mobile electronics should be useful for segments of the population. Risk acceptability is lower with greater outcome severity, or if children are impacted. Conclusions: Current water quality communications approaches must be enhanced to make notification programs more effective. Further work should build on this initial effort to evaluate risk acceptability among US beachgoers.},

abstract={The present study aimed at estimating the age and growth in three populations of Dosinia exoleta from the Portuguese coast (Aveiro in the north, Set<c3><ba>bal in the southwest and Faro in the south). Two techniques were compared to ascertain the most suitable method for ageing D. exoleta. Growth marks on the shell surface and acetate peel replicas of sectioned shells were the techniques applied. Two hypotheses were tested: growth parameters present latitudinal variation along the Portuguese coast; growth parameters are influenced by the fishing exploitation. Shell surface rings proved inappropriate for ageing this species, whereas acetate peels provided realistic estimates of the von Bertalanffy growth parameters (K, L ^sub <e2><88><9e>^ and t ^sub 0^). A latitudinal gradient in growth rate was detected, with a clear southward increase in the growth coefficient (K) of D. exoleta (Faro > Set<c3><ba>bal and Aveiro) indicating that warmer waters in southern Portugal provide optimal conditions for the growth of this species. Fishing exploitation in northern Portugal targets larger individuals and leaves behind a younger population of smaller individuals, decreasing the asymptotic shell length (L ^sub <e2><88><9e>^) of D. exoleta from Aveiro. The overall growth performance was compared among populations of D. exoleta and with other venerid species worldwide.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={The extraordinary progress experienced by sequencing technologies and bioinformatics has made the development of omic studies virtually ubiquitous in all fields of life sciences nowadays. However, scientific attention has been quite unevenly distributed throughout the different branches of the tree of life, leaving molluscs, one of the most diverse animal groups, relatively unexplored and without representation within the narrow collection of well established model organisms. Within this Phylum, bivalve molluscs play a fundamental role in the functioning of the marine ecosystem, constitute very valuable commercial resources in aquaculture, and have been widely used as sentinel organisms in the biomonitoring of marine pollution. Yet, it has only been very recently that this complex group of organisms became a preferential subject for omic studies, posing new challenges for their integrative characterization. The present contribution aims to give a detailed insight into the state of the art of the omic studies and functional information analysis of bivalve molluscs, providing a timely perspective on the available data resources and on the current and prospective applications for the biomonitoring of harmful marine compounds.},

abstract={The correlations among the contents of trace elements in the shells of short-neck clams collected from Japan, China, and the Republic of Korea were examined. Origin-specific elemental content patterns were seen in clams originating from Japan, China, and the Republic of Korea. The crushed shells were decomposed with nitric acid-hydrogen peroxide, and the concentrations of ten elements (Li, V, Mn, Co, As, Rb, Mo, Ba, Pb, and U) in the shells were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Some of the metal concentrations in the samples displayed clear geographical trends. The average concentration of Pb in Japanese clam shells was one-half to one-quarter that seen in Chinese or Korean clams. Average concentrations of As, Rb, and Ba in shells of Japanese origin were one-half those observed in Chinese or Korean clams. Linear discriminant analysis was applied to these analytical data, and four discriminant models were constructed. These discriminant models were able to distinguish the geographic origins of short-neck clams with 80.0-100 % accuracy. In particular, clams of Japanese origin were classified correctly >=90 % of the time. Therefore, the trace elemental analysis of a short-neck clam shell is useful for identifying the country of origin of the clam.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Eleutheronema rhadinum is a potential commercial fisheries species and is subject to intense exploitation in China. Knowledge on the population structure of E. rhadinum in Chinese coastal waters, which is important for sustainable exploitation and proper resource management, is lacking. In the present study, the genetic diversity and population structure of E. rhadinum were evaluated using a 564-base pair fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene. A total of 76 specimens were collected from three localities around the East (Qidong and Zhoushan) and South China Seas (Zhuhai). Among these individuals, nine polymorphic sites were detected and 11 distinct haplotypes were defined. High levels of haplotype diversity (h =0.759<c2><b1>0.035) and low levels of nucleotide diversity ([pi]= 0.001 98<c2><b1>0.003 26) were observed in these populations. Hierarchical analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicated that 96.72% of the genetic variation occurred within the populations, whereas 3.28% occurred among populations. No significant genealogical branches or clusters were recognized on the neighbor-joining tree. Intra-group variation among populations was significant ([phi] ^sub st^=0.032 85, P<0.01). These results suggest that E. rhadinum populations in the East and South China Seas have developed divergent genetic structures. Tests of neutral evolution and mismatch distribution suggest that E. rhadinum may have experienced a population expansion. The present study provides basic information for the conservation and sustainable exploitation of this species.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

The response of antioxidase system and Phase I metabolism process of D. magna exposed to TCS were investigated by measuring a series of biomarkers including glutathione S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD), Erythromycin N-demethylase (ERND) and Aminopyrine N-demethylase (APND). The 48 h LC^sub 50^ of TCS was 330<c2><a0>[mu]g/L for D. magna. In the chronic test, total number of neonates per female, body length and the intrinsic rate of natural increase (r) of D. magna increased at the low exposure concentrations (1-16<c2><a0>[mu]g/L) and decreased at the high concentrations (64-128<c2><a0>[mu]g/L), while the total number of molting per adult decreased continually. The GST and CAT activities showed no significant increase in all treatments, and SOD activities were induced after 24-h exposure and inhibited after 48-h exposure at 4-128<c2><a0>[mu]g/L of concentrations. The MDA content increased after 6-h exposure but decreased after 48-h exposure at 4-128<c2><a0>[mu]g/L. EROD activities initially increased after 6-h exposure, but decreased after 24 and 48-h exposure, ERND and APND activities showed a similar temporal pattern among different treatments groups. SOD, MDA and APND were sensitive to TCS, thus they are suitable as potential biomarkers for the exposure to TCS.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Ecological Risks Assessment and Pollution Source Identification of Trace Elements in Contaminated Sediments from the Pearl River Delta, China},
abstract={Sediments from 14 stations in the Foshan Waterway, a river crossing the industrial district of Guangdong Province, South China, were sampled and subsequently analyzed. The 14 stations were selected for the pollution discharging features of the river, such as the hydrology, the distribution of pollution sources, and the locations of wastewater outlets. The ecological risks were assessed, and the pollution sources were identified to provide valuable information for environmental impact assessment and pollution control. The spatial variability was high and the range were (in milligrams per kilogram dry weight): Pb, 46.0~382.8; Cu, 33.7~ 482.3; Zn, 62.2~1,568.7; Ni, 28.5~130.7; Cr, 34.7~1,656.1; Cd, 0.50~8.53; Hg, 0.02~8.27; and As, 5.77~66.09. The evaluation results of enrichment factor and potential ecological risk index indicate that the metal pollution in the surface and bottom sediments were severely polluted and could pose serious threat to the ecosystem in most stations. Although the hazard levels of the trace element differed among the stations, Hg was the most serious pollutant in all stations. The results of principal component analysis (PCA) show that the discharge of industrial wastewater is the most important polluting factor whereas domestic sewage, which contains a large amount of organic substances, accelerates metal deposition. And potential pollution sources were identified by the way of integrating the analysis results of PCA and data gained from the local government. Therefore, the conclusion is drawn that Foshan Waterway is seriously polluted with trace elements, both in the surface sediment (0 to 20 cm) and the bottom sediments (21 to 50 cm) are contaminated.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={The impacts of climate change on Microcystis blooms in San Francisco Estuary are uncertain because factors associated with the abundance and distribution of Microcystis blooms since their inception in 1999 are poorly understood. Discrete and continuous data collected between 2004 and 2008 were used to assess what factors controlled bloom initiation and persistence, if there was an impact of the bloom on mesozooplankton abundance and toxicity or dissolved organic carbon concentration, and how these might vary with climate change. Microcystis abundance was greater in dry years than wet years and both total microcystins concentration and the microcystins content of mesozooplankton tissue increased with abundance. The bloom began in the upstream portions of the estuary and spread farther west during dry years. Bloom initiation required water temperature above 19<c2><b0>C and surface irradiance in the visible range above 100 W m^sup -2^. The bloom persisted during a wide range of water quality conditions but was closely correlated with low turbidity. The intensity of Microcystis blooms will likely increase with climate change due to increased water temperature and low streamflow during droughts. Elevated water temperature earlier in the spring could also extend the duration of Microcystis blooms by up to 3 months.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={The reconstructed Lake Karla, Greece, has been undergoing its water-filling period since November 2009. In this paper, we aimed at investigating whether the unicellular eukaryotes, including the toxic/parasitic ones, that have been found during mass fish kills in the lake (March-April 2010), persist during the first warm period of the lake (May, August, November 2010). Given that microscopic characterization of some of these eukaryotes is not adequate for their identification, we analysed the 18S rRNA gene diversity of plankton samples. All the found phylotypes belonged to the phyla of Mesomycetazoa, Chlorophyta, Fungi, Alveolata, Cercozoa, Cryptophyta and Stramenopiles. Some members of these groups seem to persist in Lake Karla as they have been found in early spring as well. These microscopic eukaryotes are either ichthyotoxic/parasitic (e.g. Pfiesteria sp./Pseudopfiesteria shumwayae, some Fungi, Mesomycetazoa, Lagenidium sp., Cercozoa) or indicative of hyper-eutrophic conditions (e.g. Oocystis sp., Scenedesmus spp.) and were rather abundant during the first spring-autumn period of the lake's refilling process. These complex microscopic communities are expected to shape highly dynamic and variable food webs with the risk of repeated fish kills.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Assessing ammonium (NH^sub 4^ ^sup +^) availability in aquatic systems requires accurate concentration and turnover rate data. Water column NH^sub 4^ ^sup +^ regeneration, potential NH^sub 4^ ^sup +^ uptake, and nitrogen (N) fixation rates were measured in Missisquoi Bay, Lake Champlain, to help constrain internal N dynamics affecting phytoplankton community structure and cyanobacteria (Cy) blooms. Cyanobacteria dominated phytoplankton biomass during occasional summer bloom periods, but low or undetectable N2 fixation rates and low heterocyte abundances suggested that N fixing cyanobacteria did not rely on atmospheric N2. Light/dark incubations revealed that photosynthetic and dark NH^sub 4^ ^sup +^ uptake generally were balanced, highlighting the importance of bacterial uptake. Our results suggest that phytoplankton were not controlled by nutrients from the "bottom-up"; rather, water column N dynamics responded to phytoplankton patterns. Basin-scale water column NH^sub 4^ ^sup +^ regeneration rates were about 700,000 mol N day^sup -1^ (9.8 t N day^sup -1^), which is almost twice the estimated N load from tributaries, and suggests a primary role for water column N regeneration in supporting primary production. Comparisons of basin-scale NH^sub 4^ ^sup +^ regeneration and demand imply that primary production is not sustained fully by combined water column regeneration and tributary N inputs; thus, future research should constrain additional sources and sinks affecting N balance in this and other aquatic systems.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

After 12 h, MCLR content in liver did not differ between fish fed with crushed or intact cells, demonstrating O. hatcheri's capacity to digest cyanobacteria and absorb MCLR. In the second experiment, fish received toxic cells, non-toxic cells, or control food; MCLR accumulation was monitored for 48 h. Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), catalase (CAT), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities, and lipid peroxidation (as MDA) were measured in liver and intestine. Methanol-extractable MCLR was determined by PP1 inhibition assay (PPIA); extractable and protein-bound MCLR were measured by Lemieux oxidation-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). MCLR accumulated rapidly up to 22.9 and 9.4<c2><a0>[mu]g MCLR/g in intestine and liver, respectively, followed by a decreasing tendency. Protein-bound MCLR represented 66 to ca. 100 % of total MCLR in both tissues. PP1 activity remained unchanged in intestine but was increased in liver of MCLR treated fish.CAT and GST activities and MDA content were significantly increased by MCLR only in liver. We conclude that O. hatcheri is able to digest cyanobacteria, accumulating MCLR mostly bound to proteins. Our data suggest that this freshwater fish can be adversely affected by cyanobacterial blooms. However, the rapid decrease of the detectable MCLR in both tissues could imply that sublethal toxin accumulation is rapidly reversed.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Preliminary socio-economic data and analysis reveal that the tribe's vulnerability to climate change is related to cultural and economic dependence on Pyramid Lake, while external socio-economic vulnerability factors influence adaptive capacity and amplify potential impacts. Reduced water supplies as a consequence of climate change would result in a compounded reduction of inflows to Pyramid Lake, thus potentially impacting the spawning and sustenance of a cultural livelihood, the endangered cui-ui fish (Chasmistes cujus). Meanwhile, limited economic opportunities and dwindling federal support constrain tribal adaptive capacity. Factors that contribute to tribal adaptive capacity include: sustainability-based values, technical capacity for natural resource management, proactive initiatives for the control of invasive-species, strong external scientific networks, and remarkable tribal awareness of climate change.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Abstract The bivalve Perumytilus purpuratus is a common species that is widely distributed throughout rocky intertidal zones in Chile. This bivalve is the first intermediate host for three trematode species: one bucephalid (an undetermined species) and two fellodistomids (Proctoeces lintoni and one undetermined species). A few studies based on morphological comparisons, experimental infection and molecular analyses have been performed to ascertain the taxon (at least at the family level) to which these trematodes belong; yet, there remains no clarification about the specific identity of these trematodes. Therefore, in this study, we compared the V4 region nucleotide sequences of the 18S rRNA of these three sporocyst species, classified as morphotypes, found in P. purpuratus and nine adult trematode species from intertidal fishes that are likely definitive hosts for these parasites. The sequences from two of the sporocyst morphotypes matched with adult trematodes from the intertidal fish: type 1 sporocyst was similar to Prosorhynchoides carvajali (Bucephalidae), with a mean genetic divergence of 0.78%, and type 2 sporocyst was similar to Proctoeces sp. (but not P. lintoni), with 0% genetic divergence. The third species (type 3 sporocyst) was classified to the family Fellodistomidae; however, the sequence from this species differed greatly from the three other fellodistomid species documented in the marine fish of Chile and from other fellodistomids in public databases. Moreover, this morphotype has a particular cercarial morphology that greatly differs from other fellodistomid species described thus far. Therefore, this intriguing trematode remains a mystery.

Results showed that oxidative stress was evoked evidently for the experimental groups with longer exposure duration, as indicated by significant inhibition in the antioxidant enzymes activities and decrease in the reduced glutathione level, as well as simultaneous elevation of lipid peroxidation level measured by malondialdehyde content. In addition, it was found that BDE-209 possessed a higher oxidative stress inducing ability than DBDPE. Considering the more pronounced antioxidant responses in combined exposure, the interaction of BDE-209 and DBDPE was presumed to be additive action.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Synthetic pyrethroids are classified as moderately toxic to mammals and birds; nevertheless, they are highly toxic to non-target aquatic organisms such as fish and zooplankters. Chemical pollutants produce different effects in exposed organisms, ranging from biochemical to population responses. Cladocerans can modify the energy content of their offspring according to the surrounding medium as a way to improve their odds in case they have to cope with stressful conditions at birth. In this study, the effect of a synthetic pesticide on two levels of response in a Daphnia species different from those traditionally used as test organisms was evaluated. With this aim, Daphnia schoedleri neonates (<24 h) were exposed for 21 days to three sublethal concentrations of [alpha]-cypermethrin, 0.54, 5.4, and 54 ng L^sup -1^, which correspond to 48-h EC^sub 1^/100, EC^sub 1^/10, and EC^sub 1^, respectively. Effects were measured through a life table analysis for fecundity and survivorship. For effects on progeny, protein, carbohydrates, and lipids were determined and then transformed to caloric content. Biomarkers (BM) were expected to be the most sensitive evaluated response; nevertheless, population parameters such as survivorship and net reproductive rate (R^sub 0^) were more sensitive since they presented significant differences with respect to controls at the lowest tested concentration. Neonates' caloric content varied during the reproductive period assessed and was negatively correlated to fecundity: as more neonates were born, less energy was provided by the adult females. Macromolecules concentration and caloric content values in cypermethrin-exposed adults were not different from those recorded in the control at the end of exposure time. The results herein presented suggest that stressed daphnids allocate more energy reserves to their offspring, although this strategy can vary depending on the number of reproductive events during the lifecycle, and on the toxicant's concentration. Sub-individual approaches to assess toxicant effects should be accompanied by demographic studies, which support population effect predictions inferred from BMs assessment.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={In coastal ecosystems, variations in food quantity may have significant effects on the clearance and ingestion rates of suspension-feeding bivalves. In this study, clearance rates and ingestion efficiencies were determined for Japanese scallop (Patinopecten yessoensis) juveniles (60.6<c2><b1>4.5 mm in shell height) under laboratory conditions. Scallops were kept individually in glass beakers at 15<c2><b0>C and fed with different cell numbers of Pavlova sp. (0.8 to 57.60<c3><97>106 cells) to provide a wide range of food quantity as particulate organic carbon (POC). Clearance rates (CR) and ingestion efficiencies (IE) were estimated by monitoring POC concentration over a two-day period, and from 2 to 14 days of feeding, respectively. Both CR and IE were significantly influenced by POC concentration. CR ranged from 15.8 to 38.5 mL ind-1 h-1 (or 8.9 to 49.6 mg Ch-1 g dry weight-1) with maximum values at high POC concentrations. IE varied from 40 to 71% and differed significantly between the lowest (2,900 ?g C L-1) and highest (8,000 ?g C L-1) food rations. The feeding response of juvenile scallops to different POC concentrations was fitted to a power curve equation: IE (%)=0.9272<c3><97>POC0.5105, r=0.98. Extrapolated field-based estimates of IE ranged from 7.8 to 12.7% in response to seasonal changes in POC concentration (64.5 to 168.6 ?g C L-1). It is concluded that particle filtration rates by juvenile scallops are related to food quantity, as suggested by both field and laboratory-derived feeding rates.},

title={Diversidade de moluscos em riachos de uma regiÃ£o de encosta no extremo sul do Brasil/Diversity of mollusks in streams of a montane region in southern Brazil},
abstract={Stream mollusks in a region of slope in southern Brazil (Toropi River Basin) were inventoried by means of collections conducted in 40 sites, in altitudes ranging from 70 to 500 meters. At a whole, 18 species were found, represented predominantly by gastropods (11 species, 89.5% of the individuals). Potamolithus catharinae and Uncancylus concentrions were the dominant species. The latter was also well distributed, occurring in 81% of the sampling sites. Among the bivalves, only the invasive Asian clam Corbicula fluminea was abundant, but it occurred in only one sampling site. Four species were rare, being represented by less than three individuals, and the Unionoida were represented by two species only. Dominance and diversity of gastropods were higher than the bivalves, reflecting the gravel substrate of stream beds in the Toropi River Basin. The low richness recorded in the area studied is related to paucity of fine sediments and macrophytes in the streams, factors that commonly favors mollusks diversity. This condition also characterizes other southern Brazilian streams. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Reduction of zooplankton communities in small lake outlets in relation to abiotic and biotic factors},
abstract={The aim of this study was to answer the following questions: (1) which environmental variables, biotic (fish predation) or abiotic factors, have a greater influence on the rate of zooplankton changes in lake outlet sections and (2) which plankters suffer the greatest reduction in the outlet section. Samples were collected in two locations at each of 18 lakes. The first site was right at the outflow; the second site was 0.2 km downstream from the outflow. At downstream sites the percentage contribution of Rotifera in zooplankton species number and abundance was higher than in the outflow, whilst the percentage contribution of Cladocera and Copepoda (except nauplii) in the zooplankton species number and abundance was lower at downstream sites than in outlets. The most important variables affecting the rate of zooplankton reduction in the lake outlets are the biomass of cyprinids and hydrological parameters along the outlet, such as discharge, current velocity, and depth. The most dramatic reductions involved daphnids, adult copepods, small cladocerans, and copepodites, while the reduction in the abundance of rotifers and nauplii was statistically insignificant.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Beta-glucan: an ideal immunostimulant in aquaculture (a review)},
abstract={The major hindrance in the development and sustainability of aquaculture industry is the occurrence of various diseases in the farming systems. Today, preventive and management measures are central concern to overcome such outbreak of diseases. Immunostimulants are considered as an effective tool for enhancing immune status of cultured organisms. Among different immunostimulants used in aquaculture practices, [beta]-glucan is one of the promising immunostimulant, which is a homopolysaccharide of glucose molecule linked by the glycoside bond. It forms the major constituents of cell wall of some plants, fungi, bacteria, mushroom, yeast, and seaweeds. Major attention on [beta]-glucan was captivated with the gain in knowledge on its receptors and the mechanism of action. The receptor present inside the animal body recognizes and binds to [beta]-glucan, which in turn renders the animal with high resistance and enhanced immune response. This review highlights [beta]-glucan as an immunostimulant, its effective dosages, and route of administration and furthermore provides an outline on role of [beta]-glucan in enhancing growth, survival, and protection against infectious pathogens pertaining to fishes and shellfishes. Study also summarizes the effect of [beta]-glucan on its receptors, recognition of proteins, immune-related enzymes, immune-related gene expression and their mechanisms of action.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Recruits of the Caribbean scleractinian coral Porites astreoides and the octocoral Briareum asbestinum were established on artificial substrata and reared on a reef in cages designed to exclude various classes of organisms known to feed on corals. Post-settlement survivorship of recruits was measured for periods of 2<c3><82> weeks (B. asbestinum) and 1<c3><82> month (P. astreoides) on East Turtle Reef in the Florida Keys during May and June 2010. Predator exclusion did not affect survivorship among P. astreoides recruits during the study. Recruits of B. asbestinum experienced lower survivorship in treatments that allowed access by fish compared with fish exclusion treatments. The results indicate that predation may be an important determinant of post-settlement mortality among B. asbestinum recruits, and fishes are the primary contributors to predation-induced mortality. B. asbestinum recruit survivorship differed by an order of magnitude between recruits in the control condition and those in the predator exclusion (0.087 and 0.372, respectively). The findings illustrate the need to consider the effects of interactions early in life on the survival, propagation, and recovery of coral populations.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Real-time monitoring of water quality using fish and crayfish as bio-indicators: a review},
abstract={Water quality monitoring using fish and crayfish as bio-indicators requires an understanding of the state of pollution of waters, choice of bio-indicators, physiological and behavioral endpoints of fish and crayfish, and principles of the methodology and their potential applications. Here, we discuss telemetry, acoustic monitoring, vision-based monitoring, measures of ventilatory activity, electrocardiography, and fiber-optic plethysmography. Assessment of water quality must be based, not only on physicochemical characteristics of the current environment as determined by chemical analyses, but also on observations of the physiology and behavior of its inhabitants. Real-time biomonitoring is suggested as the most reliable method, since it incorporates living organisms into the system to serve as biosensors. The potential application of the methods discussed includes use at water treatment plants and water supply stations for prevention of hazardous toxicological events, and, for aquaculture, in ponds, lakes, and aquariums for monitoring growth, population size, and behavior traits.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Issue Title: Conservation, management and restoration of shallow lake ecosystems facing multiple stressors We applied a multi-proxy palaeolimnological approach to provide insights into the natural variability and human-mediated trends of two interconnected temperate large shallow lakes, Peipsi and V<c3><b5>rtsj<c3><a4>rv, during the twentieth century. The history of the lakes was assessed on the basis of age-related changes in the sediment main constituents (water, organic matter and carbonate), sub-fossil pigments, diatom assemblages and organic matter dissolved in pore water. The temporal changes in the palaeodata indicate an increase of the in-lake biological production in both lakes from about the 1960s, suggesting enhanced nutrient inputs. In subsequent decades, the gradual increase of autochthonous organic matter becomes more obvious, indicating progressive eutrophication of the lakes. Palaeolimnological indicators from the sediment record of Lake Peipsi indicate a slight recession of the lake<c3><a2>[euro](TM)s eutrophication in the 1990s but not for Lake V<c3><b5>rtsj<c3><a4>rv. The results of the study also suggest that after the lakes became eutrophied, the climatically induced water-level fluctuations ceased to be the main driver determining the abundance of phytoplankton. Responses of the lakes to human-induced impacts are better recorded in the sediments of Lake Peipsi than in those of Lake V<c3><b5>rtsj<c3><a4>rv, which is shallower of the two and where the wave-induced resuspension of deposits markedly smooths or erases the signals of environmental changes. The results of the investigation expand the knowledge on how large shallow lakes respond to human-mediated and natural perturbations, including those in the lake catchment areas and the capability of the lakes to store the chronology and sequence of these changes.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Bioaccumulation of HCH isomers in selected macroinvertebrates from the Elbe River: sources and environmental implications},
abstract={Sediments of the Elbe River have been extremely polluted by contaminants originating from previous large-scale hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) production and the application of <ce><b3>-HCH (lindane) in its catchment in the second half of the twentieth century. In order to gain knowledge on bioaccumulation processes at lower trophic levels, field investigations of HCHs in macroinvertebrates were carried out along the longitudinal profile of the Elbe and tributary. Among the sites studied, concentrations in macroinvertebrates ranged within five orders of magnitude (0.01-100 [mu]g/kg). In general, lower values of HCH isomers were observed at all Czech sites (mostly <1 [mu]g/kg) compared with those in Germany. At the most contaminated site, Spittelwasser brook (a tributary of the Mulde), extremely high concentrations were measured (up to 234 [mu]g/kg [alpha]-HCH and 587 [mu]g/kg [beta]-HCH in Hydropsychidae). In contrast, the Obr<c3><ad>stv<c3><ad> site, though also influenced by HCH production facilities, showed only negligibly elevated values (mostly <1 [mu]g/kg). Results showed that fairly high levels of [alpha]-HCH and [beta]-HCH compared to <ce><b3>-HCH can still be detected in aquatic environments of the Elbe catchment, and these concentrations are decreasing over time to a lesser extent than <ce><b3>-HCH. Higher HCH concentrations in sediments in the springtime are considered to be the result of erosion and transport processes during and after spring floods, and lower concentrations at sites downstream are thought to be caused by the time lapse involved in the transportation of contaminated particles from upstream. In addition, comparison with fish (bream) data from the literature revealed no increase in tissue concentrations between invertebrates and fish.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Thioredoxin (Trx) proteins are involved in many biological processes especially the regulation of cellular redox homeostasis. In this study, two Trx cDNAs were cloned from the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis using rapid amplifi cation of cDNA ends-polymerase chain reaction (RACE-PCR). The two cDNAs were named MgTrx1 and MgTrx2, respectively. The open reading frames of MgTrx1 and MgTrx2 were 318 and 507 base pairs (bp) and they encoded proteins of 105 and 168 amino acids with estimated molecular masses of 11.45 and 18.93 kDa, respectively. Sequence analysis revealed that both proteins possessed the conserved active site dithiol motif Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys. In addition, MgTrx2 also possessed a putative mitochondrial targeting signal suggesting that it is located in the mitochondria. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) revealed that both MgTrx1 and MgTrx2 were constitutively expressed in all tissues examined. The MgTrx1 transcript was most abundant in hemocytes and gills, whereas the MgTrx2 transcript was most abundant in gonad, hepatopancreas, gill and hemocytes. Following Vibrio anguillarum challenge, the expression of MgTrx1 was up-regulated and reached its peak, at a value 10-fold the initial value, at 24 h. Subsequently, expression returned back to the original level. In contrast, the expression level of MgTrx2 was down-regulated following bacterial stimulation, with one fi fth of the control level evident at 12 h post challenge. These results suggest that MgTrx1 and MgTrx2 may play important roles in the response of M. galloprovincialis to bacterial challenge.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Arsenic speciation analysis showed that the less-toxic arsenobetaine (AsB) constituted 80.6<c3><a2>[euro]"98.8<c3><82> % of all As compounds, and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) constituted 0.47<c3><a2>[euro]"3.44<c3><82> %.

A strong spatial variation of metals in the oyster Saccostrea cucullata was found in the estuary, confirming that oysters can be used as a good biomonitor of metal contamination in the studied area. The concentrations of eight metals in the studied mollusks and crustaceans clearly revealed that these invertebrates accumulated different metals to different degrees. Furthermore, As, Cd, Cu, Hg, and Pb contents in mollusks and crustacean samples were below the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) safe concentrations, thus there was no obvious health risk from the intake of the metals through marine mollusks and crustaceans consumption.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Impact of tributary DOM and nutrient inputs on the nearshore ecology of a large, oligotrophic lake (Georgian Bay, Lake Huron, Canada)},
abstract={Two adjacent bays in a large oligotrophic lake (Georgian Bay, Lake Huron) were compared to determine how the inputs from relatively pristine, but moderately humic, tributaries may influence phytoplankton, nutrients and system metabolism. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations decreased from 4 to 5 gC m^sup -3^ at inner sites to 2 gC m^sup -3^ or less at outer sites. The concentration gradient from inner to outer was greater in the bay with a major tributary, and optical properties (intensity and slope of light absorption spectrum) showed there was a loss of material with allochthonous characteristics along the gradient. Chlorophyll a (Chl a) and total phosphorus (TP) were also higher at inner (2-4 mg Chl a m^sup -3^ and 8-12 mgP m^sup -3^, respectively) than outer sites (<=1 mg Chl a m^sup -3^ and 4-5 mgP m^sup -3^). Chl a and TP, as well as particulate nutrient ratios (C:P, C:N, N:P), indicated significant eutrophication at inner sites, especially in the bay with the tributary, and there was a strong positive Chl a-phosphorus relationship. The stable oxygen isotope ratio (^sup 18^O:^sup 16^O) of dissolved oxygen indicated greater influence of biological oxygen fluxes at inner sites (where ratios were 2-3 ppt below atmospheric equilibrium) than at outer sites (where ratios were within 0.5 ppt of equilibrium). Community photosynthesis:respiration ratios inferred from ^sup 18^O:^sup 16^O varied positively with Chl a and inorganic nutrients, but negatively with DOC. Altered loading of allochthonous organic matter can be expected under changing climate and development scenarios and will have significant influence on optical properties and system metabolism through changes in DOC in this coastal system. The effects will nonetheless be strongly modulated by any accompanying change in inorganic nutrients.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Energy status and immune system alterations in Elliptio complanata after ingestion of cyanobacteria Anabaena flos-aquae},
abstract={Cyanobacteria have often been described as nutritionally poor for herbivorous organisms. To gain additional information on the potential impacts of invertebrates feeding on cyanobacteria, we fed Elliptio complanata mussels with two types of algae: Anabaena flos-aquae (cyanobacteria) and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata (green algae). Physiological parameters were examined at the energy status, immune system and oxidative stress levels. Energy status was examined by following the rate of electron transport activity in mitochondria (a measure of cellular energy expense) and lipid/sugar stores in the visceral mass. The cyanobacteria were not actively producing toxins. Based on the digestive gland index, the mussels fed equally on either regime. However, the energy status in mussels fed A. flos-aquae revealed that the total sugar was lower in the digestive gland, whereas mitochondrial electron transport activity (MET), once corrected against the digestive gland somatic index, showed increased energy expenses. Acetylcholinesterase activity and lipid peroxidation (LPO) were also higher in mussels fed with A. flos-aquae compared with mussels fed with P. subcapitata. LPO was correlated by mitochondrial activity in both the digestive gland and gills, suggesting that oxidative stress resulted from metabolic respiration. Immunocompetence (phagocytic activity, natural killer cell-like activity, haemocyte count and viability) and humoral level of lysozyme were not affected in mussels by the algae or cyanobacteria regime. Moreover, the xenobiotic conjugating enzyme, glutathione S-transferase, hemoprotein oxidase and vitellogenin-like proteins were not affected in mussel organs via ingestion of A. flos-aquae. Our study suggests that ingestion of cyanobacteria leads to increased energy expenses, oxidative stress and increased acetylcholine turnover in mussels.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={We assessed if the qualitative and quantitative aspects of plankton composition in reservoirs of the middle Missouri River were influenced by hydrologic variability. Phytoplankton and zooplankton communities in six reservoirs of this highly regulated system were sampled between 2004 and 2011 during historic drought, subsequent recovery, and a 100-year flood event. The reservoir system encompasses a broad latitudinal gradient of decreasing depth, decreasing water residence time and increasing trophic state. Phytoplankton communities of the upper three reservoirs were co-dominated by planktonic and meroplanktonic diatoms during the drought, recovery, and flood periods, but the proportion of more silicified meroplanktonic diatoms increased in the lower three reservoirs as water residence time decreased. Peak phytoplankton biovolume usually occurred during spring/early summer and was associated with increased hydrologic inflows and outflows. Zooplankton biomass of the reservoir system was dominated by Daphnia spp., but all zooplankton groups decreased as inflows and outflows accelerated during the recovery and flood periods. Rotifer abundances were higher under turbulent conditions associated with dam operations. Canonical correlation analyses suggested that temperature, water residence time, station depth, and water clarity explained more variance in the structures of phytoplankton and zooplankton communities than bioavailable nutrient parameters.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Antipredator-induced trait changes in Brachionus and prey selectivity by Asplanchna in a large river under low-discharge conditions: evidence from a field study},
abstract={Trait-mediated biotic interactions within zooplankton, such as inducible defences against predation, are key determinants of community structure and dynamics in lentic ecosystems. The role of such interactions in lotic environments, however, has been rarely investigated, as abiotic constraints related to hydrology are generally thought to impair the occurrence of biotic interactions in rivers. We hypothesize that, under conditions of reduced flow during summer, trait-mediated predator-prey interactions can be significant driving forces in the main channel of a large river, despite the disruptive effect of downstream transport. To verify this assumption, we carried out a field study in the lowland stretch of the Po River (Italy). We analysed temporal patterns of morphometric variation in a population of Brachionus calyciflorus, potentially triggered by the predatory rotifer Asplanchna brightwellii. Our results indicate that the presence of Asplanchna can impact the variability of different morphological traits in B. calyciflorus even under the disturbance effect of turbulence and drift. Asplanchna feeding electivity on several taxa was also investigated, confirming the predator ability to efficiently and selectively feed under lotic conditions. We suggest that complex interactions and trade-offs might occur among life-history traits, predator-prey relationships and physical constraints imposed by flow within zooplankton communities in large rivers.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={To understand the functioning of sponges, knowledge of the structure of their associated microbial communities is necessary. However, our perception of sponge-associated microbiomes remains mainly restricted to marine ecosystems. Here, we report on the molecular diversity and composition of bacteria in the freshwater sponge Ephydatia fluviatilis inhabiting the artificial lake Vinkeveense Plassen, Utrecht, The Netherlands. Polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) fingerprints revealed that the apparent diversities within the domain Bacteria and the phylum Actinobacteria were lower in E. fluviatilis than in bulk water. Enrichment of specific PCR-DGGE bands in E. fluviatilis was detected. Furthermore, sponge- and bulk water-derived bacterial clone libraries differed with respect to bacterial community composition at the phylum level. E. fluviatilis-derived sequences were affiliated with six recognized phyla, i.e., Proteobacteria, Planctomycetes, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chlamydiae and Verrucomicrobia, in order of relative abundance; next to the uncultured candidate phylum TM7 and one deeply rooted bacterial lineage of undefined taxonomy (BLUT). Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were the dominant bacterial phyla in the freshwater clone library whereas sequences affiliated with Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia, Acidobacteria and Armatimonadetes were found at lower frequencies. Fine-tuned phylogenetic inference showed no or negligible overlaps between the E. fluviatilis and water-derived phylotypes within bacterial taxa such as Alphaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria. We also ascertained the status of two alphaproteobacterial lineages as freshwater sponge-specific phylogenetic clusters, and report on high distinctiveness of other E. fluviatilis specific phylotypes, especially within the Bacteroidetes, Planctomycetes and Chlamydia taxa. This study supports the contention that the composition and diversity of bacteria in E. fluviatilis is partially driven by the host organism.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Fjord ecosystems are particularly neglected marine ecosystems, which require better surveillance and ecotoxicological profiling. In this context, this study focuses on exploring three potential indicators for aquatic stress [polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), aromatic amines (AAs), and nitroarenes (NAs)] by the study of their molecular and sub-molecular properties. The results show that the aromatic amine, 4-aminobiphenyl, gains a particularly reactive electronic potential, which can be summarized as a large change in LUMO+2 and HOMO-1 electron orbitals upon metabolic activation in the organism. This change in orbitals increases the overall electrostatic energy of the molecule, inducing a high affinity for DNA-adduct formation. Electronic analysis on nitroarenes shows in addition why 1,6-dinitropyrene is more stable than 1,8-dinitropyrene, and how the electrons favor nitrenium activation on the 6th and 8th carbon. Further analysis shows also that PAHs have a present correlation with hormonal similarity, and that their resemblance to estrogen can be correlated to mutagenicity, contributing to increased ecotoxicity. The electronic analysis of these three types of fossil pollutants shows how their toxicity is exerted from the electronic level and which structural features that determine the level of reactivity and toxicity. The summation of the background and electronic properties of these molecular toxins elucidates that PAHs, aromatic amines, and nitroarenes are all of equal importance as stress indicators for fjord systems, with particular emphasis on PAHs, which also exert hormonal structural similarities as a probable base of their carcinogenic mechanisms.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Does size matter? The effects of body size and declining oxygen tension on oxygen uptake in gastropods},
abstract={Metabolic rate is one of the most frequently measured physiological variables and the relationship between oxygen uptake and body mass is one of the most controversial issues in biology. The present study used closed chamber respirometry to compare the oxygen uptake of 32 species of benthic British gastropod molluscs of a wide size-range (from less than 0.001 g to greater than 10 g dry tissue weight). We investigated the effects of body size on the respiratory rate at 10<c2><b0>C to explore the evolutionary and phylogenetically determined patterns of metabolic scaling both among different gastropods groups, and within siphonate and asiphonate caenogastropods. Resting oxygen uptake ( O2) increased with body mass (W) with a slope value of 0.6 using both ordinary least squares (OLS) and standard major axis (SMA) where N = 488, over a 6 fold range of body mass. The slopes b of the regression lines relating oxygen uptake to body mass were similar for all heterobranch molluscs and most caenogastropods. Highest mass-specific rates for oxygen consumption were found for the smallest littorinid species. Trophic mode significantly affected the amount of oxygen consumed with higher oxygen uptake in herbivores than other groups, including detritivores and predators. All of the gastropods reduced their oxygen consumption when exposed to declining oxygen conditions; however, about a third of the species exhibited partial regulation at higher oxygen partial pressures. When exposed to 20% normal saturation levels, smaller gastropods respired at approximately 25% of their rates in fully saturated seawater whereas larger species (above 0.1 g dry tissue weight) respired at approximately 35% of the values recorded at full saturation. Our study suggests that a scaling exponent relating O2 to body mass of 0.6 is typical and may be 'universal' for gastropods. It is below the 0.75 scaling exponent which has been proposed for ectothermic invertebrates. It is concluded that size does matter in determining the metabolic patterns of gastropods and that the quantity of oxygen consumed and the energy balance of gastropods is affected by activity, food type and exposure to declining oxygen conditions.

abstract={Issue Title: Special Issue: AQUASHIFT: The Impact of Climate Variability on Aquatic Ecosystems The objective of our study was to analyze the effects of temperature on the population dynamics of a three-species food web consisting of two prey bacteria (Pedobacter sp. and Acinetobacter johnsonii) and a protozoan predator (Tetrahymena pyriformis) as model organisms. We assessed the effects of temperature on the growth rates of all three species with the objective of developing a model with four differential equations based on the experimental data. The following hypotheses were tested at a theoretical level: Firstly, temperature changes can affect the dynamic behavior of a system by temperature-dependent parameters and interactions and secondly, food web response to temperature cannot be derived from the single species temperature response. The main outcome of the study is that temperature changes affect the parameter range where coexistence is possible within all three species. This has significant consequences on our ideas regarding the evaluation of effects of global warming.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={In marine organisms the multi xenobiotic resistance (MXR) mechanism via e.g. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) is an important first line of defense against contaminants by pumping contaminants out of the cells. If compounds would impair the MXR mechanism, this could result in increased intracellular levels of other compounds, thereby potentiating their toxicity. A calcein-AM based larval cellular efflux pump inhibition assay (CEPIA) was developed for echinoid (Psammechinus miliaris) larvae and applied for several contaminants. The larval CEPIA revealed that triclosan (TCS) and the nanoparticles P-85^sup ^ (P-85) were 124 and 155<c3><97> more potent inhibitors (IC^sub 50^ 0.5<c2><a0><c2><b1><c2><a0>0.05 and 0.4<c2><a0><c2><b1><c2><a0>0.1<c2><a0><ce><bc>M, respectively) of efflux pumps than the model inhibitor Verapamil (VER). PFOS (heptadecafluorooctane sulfonic acid) and pentachlorophenol also were more potent than VER, 24 and 5<c3><97>, respectively. Bisphenol A and o,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (o,p'-DDT) inhibited efflux pumps with a potency 3<c3><97> greater than VER. In a 48<c2><a0>h early life stage bioassay with P. miliaris, exposure to a non-lethal concentration of the inhibitors TCS, VER, the model MRP inhibitor MK-571, the nanoparticles P-85 and the model P-gp inhibitor PSC-833, increased the toxicity of the toxic model substrate for efflux pumps vinblastine by a factor of 2, 4, 4, 8 and 16, respectively. Our findings show that several contaminants accumulating in the marine environment inhibit cellular efflux pumps, which could potentiate toxic effects of efflux pumps substrates.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={This study examined the impact of oxidative stress indicated by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and protein carbonyl (PC), induced by intensive exercise and cadmium chloride (CdCl2) on ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity in juvenile carp (Cyprinus carpio). In the first experiment, fish were divided into three groups: (1) control, (2) carp exposed to intensive exercise, and (3) carp that was not exercised but previously, as well as carp in group 2, received single dose of 3-methylcholantrene (3-MC). The third and sixth day fish were sacrificed and the measurements were conducted. In the second experiment, fish were divided into (1) control, (2) carp in water containing CdCl2, and (3) carp in dechlorinated tap water (2 and 3 received single dose of 3-MC on the seventh day after exposure to CdCl2). The carp were killed 6 days later and livers were excised for biochemical analyses. In the first experiment, on the sixth day after treatment with 3-MC, results show statistically significant increase in EROD activity in non-exercised carp, while that increase in carp exposed to intensive exercise was significantly lower. Three days after exposure to 3-MC, statistically significant increase in TBARS was observed in both exercised and non-exercised carp. Six days after exposure to 3-MC, PC levels were significantly higher in exercised carp. Pretreatment with CdCl2, in the second experiment, caused oxidative stress and reduction of EROD activity.

abstract={Paracetamol is an antipyretic analgesic widely used globally. It has been recurrently found in water bodies and is known to elicit toxic effects in aquatic species; however, its potential ability to induce oxidative stress in sentinel species remains unknown. The objective was to establish a methodology to evaluate the toxicity elicited on the sentinel species Hyalella azteca by paracetamol-enriched sediment using oxidative stress tests. Concentrations used in assays were determined using the previously obtained median lethal concentration (72 h LC50). The following oxidative stress biomarkers were evaluated: lipid peroxidation (LPO), protein carbonyl content (PCC) in order to determine oxidized protein content, and the activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPX). LPO and PCC increased significantly while SOD, CAT, and GPX decreased significantly (p<0.05) with respect to controls. Paracetamol induces oxidative stress on H. azteca, and the set of tests employed is helpful in evaluating the toxicity of this group of pharmaceuticals on aquatic species. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Thus, monitoring studies are very important because fish health reflects both quality and sustainability of the environment, as well as of the individuals that live there. In the present report, genetic biomarkers (piscine micronucleus test; comet assay with blood, liver, and kidney cells) were used in specimens of Astyanax sp. to analyze the contamination level of the Cang<c3><bc>iri Farm through biomonitoring. The Cang<c3><bc>iri Farm, the old school farm of the Federal University of Paran<c3><a1>, is inside the Ira<c3><ad> River Environment Preservation Area, created in 1996 to preserve the sources of public water supply in Curitiba and metropolitan area. We verified that the fishes collected within the Cang<c3><bc>iri Farm area presented high damage levels, showing more environment contamination when compared to the specimens collected in the Costa Ecologic Park, used as reference in the present report. The results indicate that the Cang<c3><bc>iri Farm, which is inside an environment protection area, created especially for the protection of the fountainhead for water supply, may be contaminated. These toxic residues, which were remarkably persistent in the environment, are possibly derived from agricultural activities in the wider area. Thus, we suggest the analysis of the area with other biomarkers and for a longer time period.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Because toxicants rarely occur alone in the environment, a major challenge in risk assessment is to address the combined effects of chemicals on aquatic organisms. This work is aimed at investigating the joint toxicity action of binary mixtures of cadmium and arsenate on Gammarus pulex. Individuals were exposed during 240<c2><a0>h to four single arsenate or cadmium concentrations and binary mixtures of these metals according to a complete factorial plane. Observed mortality in binary mixtures was compared to observed mortality in single arsenate or cadmium exposures. In addition, interactive effects (antagonistic, additive or synergistic) were evaluated using a predictive model for the theoretically expected interactive effect of chemicals. For all the tested concentration combinations, we observed an antagonist 'between-metals' interaction on G. pulex mortality. This antagonistic effect was more marked for the lowest than for the highest (i.e. 1502.0<c2><a0><ce><bc>g^sub AsV^<c2><a0>L^sup -1^ and 28.5<c2><a0><ce><bc>g^sub Cd^<c2><a0>L^sup -1^) tested concentrations of individual metals in binary mixtures.

abstract={Bioaccumulation enables to integrate the ability of aquatic organisms to regulate metals and effects of water chemistry on metal bioavailability. Linking this process to biological responses offers thus promising lines of enquiry for protecting aquatic ecosystems. This study aims at characterizing the mechanisms involved in waterborne Cu bioaccumulation and assessing metal impact on digestive metabolism in an ecosystem engineer widely distributed in Europe, Gammarus pulex. The organism was exposed to several Cu concentrations (from 0.5 to 100<c2><a0><ce><bc>g/L) in aquatic microcosms to establish kinetic parameters for the construction and comparison of two bioaccumulation models, i.e. the biodynamic and saturation models. Cu uptake was recorded in waters exhibiting various concentrations of Na, Mg and Ca at environmental levels to assess the influence of cationic composition on bioaccumulation. Then, the effect of increasing Cu in exposure media on the digestive metabolism of G. pulex was investigated by measuring enzymatic activities (<ce><b2>-glucosidase, N-acetyl-<ce><b2>-glucosaminidase, <ce><b2>-galactosidase). We showed that the saturation model is more suitable than the biodynamic model to describe Cu bioaccumulation in gammarids due to a maximal capacity of animals to accumulate the metal. Cationic composition of water affected insignificantly Cu uptake. All activities of tested enzymes decreased with increasing Cu in exposure media but with different degrees. High correlations were established between the inhibition of enzymatic activities and amounts of Cu bioaccumulated by gammarids. These biological responses could thus provide early-warming of Cu impact on aquatic biota.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Chiral pharmaceuticals in the environment},
abstract={Many pharmaceutical pollutants are chiral, existing in the environment as a single enantiomer or as mixtures of the two enantiomers. In spite of their similar physical and chemical properties, the different spatial configurations lead the enantiomers to have different interactions with enzymes, receptors or other chiral molecules, which can give diverse biological response. Consequently, biodegradation process and ecotoxicity tend to be enantioselective. Despite numerous ongoing research regarding analysis and monitorization of pharmaceutical ingredients in the environment, the fate and effects of single enantiomers of chiral pharmaceuticals (CP) in the environment are still largely unknown. There are only few chiral analytical methods to accurately measure the enantiomeric fraction (EF) in environmental matrices and during biodegradation processes. Furthermore, the ecotoxicity studies usually consider the enantiomeric pair as unique compound. We reviewed the current knowledge about CP in the environment, as well as the chiral analytical methods to determine the EF in environmental matrices. The degradation and removal processes of CP of important therapeutic classes, usually detected in the environment, and their toxicity to aquatic organisms were also reviewed. On the other hand, this review demonstrate that despite the great importance of the stereochemistry in pharmaceutical science, pharmacology and organic chemistry, this is normally neglected in environmental studies. Therefore, CP in the environment need much more attention from the scientific community, and more research within this subject is required.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

The situation was different for PCBs that were released to a much lower extent from glaciers. The PCB 138 ratio between zooplankton and fish was always around one<e2><80><93>two in both years. As the zooplankton response to pollution changes resulted particularly prompt, our research highlights the importance of this component as an early warning bioindicator of hydrophobic pollutants.},

Fouling communities were collected for a period of one year (June 2006-May 2007) by suspended white test panels at different depths (from 0.5 m to 5.5 m) in two directions (horizontal and vertical). Panels were submerged on short-term durations of 30 days. Every panel was studied (on both sides) for species composition and abundance of fouling taxa, as well as the total biomass of the community. Data of fouling assemblages obtained were analysed, using ANOVA and non-parametric tests in order to compare the variations of assemblages with season, depth and direction. In general, the abundance and biomass of fouling community were significantly related to the season and depth rather than orientation. Although comparison of fouling assemblages (for direction) between the panel surfaces were not statistically significant; the horizontal panels, in particular, support more fouling organisms.},

abstract={Larval and juvenile growth stages of myoconchid bivalves (family Kalenteridae) are illustrated and described for the first time. Excellently preserved shells of Myoconcha crassa J. Sowerby, 1824 from the middle Bathonian (Middle Jurassic) clay/silt deposits of southern Poland reveal that the prodissoconch in this taxon is large (exceeding 350 <c2><b5>m in length) and characterized by a prominent, collar-like structure arising from the demarcation to the dissoconch. Similar prodissoconch morphology has not been described previously in any other bivalve genus. The large size and absence of a prodissoconch II strongly suggest a non-planktotrophic development of the larvae, indicating either simple lecithotrophy or long-term brooding and parental care for the larvae in this species. Consequently, the new discovery constitutes the earliest well-documented record of non-planktotrophic development in the Bivalvia. The shell of Myoconcha crassa is composed of an outer cross-lamellar layer and an inner complex cross-lamellar layer. This composition suggests that the Kalenteridae may be included in the Carditida rather than the Palaeoheterodonta or Anomalodesmata. The genus Pseudomyoconcha Rossi Ronchetti and Allasinaz, 1966 is rejected herein and considered as a junior synonym of Myoconcha J. Sowerby, 1824. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

To assess long-term contamination trends in the Elbe after socio-economical changes in 1989, selected macroinvertebrate species were used to identify biotic accumulation levels in the period from 1993 to 2005. Concentrations of As, Cd, Pb, and Hg were determined in Asellus aquaticus (Crustacea), Bythinia tentaculata (Mollusca), Erpobdella spp. (Hirudinea), and larvae of the family Chironomidae (Diptera) over a 3-year period along the longitudinal profile of the Czech part of the Elbe River and the lower Vltava (the main Elbe tributary). In this study, new evaluative approaches were used to assess these multiparameter data sets. The results showed that the most contaminated Czech sites were located in the industry-heavy middle Elbe region between Valy and Obr<c3><ad>stv<c3><ad>. Surprisingly high concentrations of As, Cd, and Pb were observed in the upper stretch near the headwaters. Probably as a consequence of former mining activities and the metallurgic and glass industries, the lower Vltava was loaded with Cd and Pb.

A significant decrease of Hg was revealed, however, occurring already between 1993 and 1996. The results of interspecies comparisons showed that the investigated elements were most accumulated by chironomid larvae and Erpobdella spp. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={We have developed a model for dissolved oxygen (DO) transfer from water to underlying organic sediment beds. The model couples large-eddy simulation (LES) of turbulent transport in the water column, a biogeochemical model for DO transport and consumption in the sediment, and Darcy's Law for the pore water-driven transport. The model highlights the spatial and temporal relationship between the turbulent bursting events, the near-wall transport of DO, and the response of the sediment layer. The numerical resultscompared to data from laboratory experimentsstress the importance of analyzing instantaneous transport events (not reproducible in a Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes model) to better characterize and model the processes that lead to oxygen depletion in the sediment layer. The model's results are compared against experimental data and the sensitivity to the governing parameters has been tested. As the current velocity increases, the sediment-oxygen demand (SOD) increases more slowly than the friction velocity at the wall, in accordance with classic heat-and-mass transfer laws. The overall SOD is approximately proportional to the bacterial content of the sediment layer. The predicted mean advective flux in the porous medium and across the sediment-water interface is negligible compared to the total dispersive flux, for permeabilities typical of the sediments used in the experiments (107 and 106 cm2). Higher permeabilities (105 cm2) appear to yield results not consistent with experimental data. This computational tool will contribute toward the design of a process-oriented parametrization for the SOD, currently missing in oceanographic applications, that can be easily extended to the transport of other bio-limiting substances.},

abstract={The highest concentrations of environmental contaminants are generally found in marine sediments, and there is a need for knowledge concerning how and whether they affect sediment-dwelling organisms. This study aimed to assess sublethal effects in Arenicola marina exposed to two sediments from a contaminated fjord and two reference locations with different sediment characteristics. Duplicate contaminated sediments were used to investigate the robustness of current protocols for sediment testing. The two reference sediments, with different grain sizes and total organic carbon, were collected from the outer Oslofjord and the two contaminated sediments from Frierfjord. Polychaetes were exposed in quadruplicate sediment microcosms and sampled after 1, 2, 4 and 8<c2><a0>weeks of exposure. Oxidative stress resistance (total oxyradical scavenging capacity, TOSC) and components comprising the energy budget (cellular energy allocation, CEA) were determined for individual polychaetes. Arenicola maintained and increased body weights over the initial 4<c2><a0>weeks of exposure in all groups, except in one reference sediment (Elle). There were no differences between treatments in the scavenging capacity (TOSC). The most striking difference in how polychaetes partitioned energy resources was a difference in lipid and carbohydrate allocations for Arenicola held in the contaminated sediments over the initial weeks. Cellular respiration appeared to increase in polychaetes held in the Elle sediment and decreased for polychaetes held in the two Frierfjord sediments by weeks<c2><a0>4 and 8. In the overall CEA, this was offset by increased energy per weight stored in the Elle group, which resulted in an overall positive CEA for polychaetes held in that sediment, whereas polychaetes in the other treatments were close to neutral. Although CEA would thus indicate that Elle polychaetes had good health status, their body weight also decreased significantly over the experimental period compared to other treatments, indicating an overall negative effect. This study has shown the importance of sediment characteristics when evaluating toxicity and how resource allocation can differ dramatically over a short time span in polychaetes held in similarly contaminated sediments. There were no clear effects of sediment contamination on CEA or TOSC in the polychaete A. marina. The findings are relevant for the design of both short- and long-term sediment studies.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Change in the abundance of benthic macroinvertebrates and the stable isotope composition (C, N) of benthic invertebrates and zooplankton in Lake Vaeng, Denmark, was investigated over an 18-year period following biomanipulation (removal of cyprinids). During the first nine years after biomanipulation, the lake was clear and submerged macrophytes were abundant; after this period, a shift occurred to low plant abundance and high turbidity. Two years after the biomanipulation, total density of benthic macroinvertebrates reached a maximum of 17042 (<c2><b1>2335 SE) individuals<c2><a0>m^sup -2^ and the density was overall higher when the lake was in a clear state. Redundancy analysis (RDA) suggested macrophyte abundance and total nitrogen (TN) concentration were the dominant structuring forces on the benthic macroinvertebrate assemblage. Stable isotope analysis revealed that <ce><b4>^sup 13^C of macroinvertebrates and zooplankton was markedly higher in years with high submerged macrophyte abundance than in years without macrophytes, most likely reflecting elevated <ce><b4>^sup 13^C of phytoplankton and periphyton mediated by a macrophyte-induced lowering of lake water CO2 concentrations. We conclude that the strong relationship between macrophyte coverage and <ce><b4>^sup 13^C of macroinvertebrates and cladocerans may be useful in paleoecological studies of past changes in the dynamics of shallow lakes, as change in macrophyte abundance may be tracked by the <ce><b4>^sup 13^C of invertebrate remains in the sediment.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={The individual and population effects of tetracycline on Daphnia magna in multigenerational exposure},
abstract={Multigenerational exposure of Daphnia magna to tetracycline was carried out through four consecutive generations. The effects of tetracycline on the survival, reproduction and growth of D. magna were assessed over a period of 21<c2><a0>days per generation. The evaluated endpoints were overall fecundity (total mean neonates per female over 21<c2><a0>days), time to first reproduction, longevity, molting number and somatic growth, such as body weight and body length. Using the results obtained for reproduction and survival rates, the intrinsic population growth rate (PGR) was calculated and compared throughout the generations. Reproductive impairment was observed in all generations and magnified with increasing generation number. The value of no observed effect concentration on D. magna also markedly decreased with increasing generation number. This subsequently resulted in a reduction of the PGR value. In addition, the PGR value was decreased with increasing exposure concentration, decreasing by about 30 and 60% at 0.1 and 5.0<c2><a0>mg/L tetracycline, respectively. On the other hands, somatic growth increased with increasing generation number, because the remaining input energy from the reduced reproduction was mainly used for body maintenance. As a result, the somatic growth and reproduction showed reversed trends on continuous exposure of tetracycline to four generations. In conclusion, multigenerational exposure of tetracycline can induce overall responses on reproduction and the somatic growth of D. magna. Moreover, the PGR value of D. magna exposed to tetracycline was reduced with increasing generation number; thereby, inhibiting the long term propagation of D. magna.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Assessment of microcystin distribution and biomagnification in tissues of aquatic food web compartments from a shallow lake and evaluation of potential risks to public health},
abstract={The objectives of this study were: (1) to examine the distribution and bioaccumulation of microcystins in the main components of the food web (phytoplankton, zooplankton, crayfish, shrimp, mussel, snail, fish, frog) of Lake Pamvotis (NW Greece), (2) to investigate the possibility of microcystin biomagnification and (3) to evaluate the potential threat of the contaminated aquatic organisms to human health. Significant microcystin concentrations were detected in all the aquatic organisms during two different periods, with the higher concentrations observed in phytoplankton and the lower in fish species and frogs. This is the first study reporting microcystin accumulation in the body of the freshwater shrimp Atyaephyra desmsaresti, in the brain of the fish species common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and in the skin of the frog Rana epirotica. Although there was no evidence for microcystin biomagnification, the fact that microcystins were found in lake water and in the tissues of aquatic organisms, suggests that serious risks to animal and public health are possible to occur. In addition, it is likely to be unsafe to consume aquatic species harvested in Lake Pamvotis due to the high-concentrations of accumulated microcystins.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Practical considerations for conducting ecotoxicity test methods with manufactured nanomaterials: what have we learnt so far?},
abstract={This review paper reports the consensus of a technical workshop hosted by the European network, NanoImpactNet (NIN). The workshop aimed to review the collective experience of working at the bench with manufactured nanomaterials (MNMs), and to recommend modifications to existing experimental methods and OECD protocols. Current procedures for cleaning glassware are appropriate for most MNMs, although interference with electrodes may occur. Maintaining exposure is more difficult with MNMs compared to conventional chemicals. A metal salt control is recommended for experiments with metallic MNMs that may release free metal ions. Dispersing agents should be avoided, but if they must be used, then natural or synthetic dispersing agents are possible, and dispersion controls essential. Time constraints and technology gaps indicate that full characterisation of test media during ecotoxicity tests is currently not practical. Details of electron microscopy, dark-field microscopy, a range of spectroscopic methods (EDX, XRD, XANES, EXAFS), light scattering techniques (DLS, SLS) and chromatography are discussed. The development of user-friendly software to predict particle behaviour in test media according to DLVO theory is in progress, and simple optical methods are available to estimate the settling behaviour of suspensions during experiments. However, for soil matrices such simple approaches may not be applicable. Alternatively, a Critical Body Residue approach may be taken in which body concentrations in organisms are related to effects, and toxicity thresholds derived. For microbial assays, the cell wall is a formidable barrier to MNMs and end points that rely on the test substance penetrating the cell may be insensitive. Instead assays based on the cell envelope should be developed for MNMs. In algal growth tests, the abiotic factors that promote particle aggregation in the media (e.g. ionic strength) are also important in providing nutrients, and manipulation of the media to control the dispersion may also inhibit growth. Controls to quantify shading effects, and precise details of lighting regimes, shaking or mixing should be reported in algal tests. Photosynthesis may be more sensitive than traditional growth end points for algae and plants. Tests with invertebrates should consider non-chemical toxicity from particle adherence to the organisms. The use of semi-static exposure methods with fish can reduce the logistical issues of waste water disposal and facilitate aspects of animal husbandry relevant to MMNs. There are concerns that the existing bioaccumulation tests are conceptually flawed for MNMs and that new test(s) are required. In vitro testing strategies, as exemplified by genotoxicity assays, can be modified for MNMs, but the risk of false negatives in some assays is highlighted. In conclusion, most protocols will require some modifications and recommendations are made to aid the researcher at the bench.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Although sediments of the German Wadden Sea are suspected to eliminate a considerable share of nitrate delivered to the SE North Sea, their denitrification rates have not been systematically assessed. We determined N2 production rates over seasonal cycles (February 2009-April 2010) at two locations with two sediments types each, the first site (Meldorf Bight) receiving nitrate during all seasons from the Elbe river plume, and a second site on the island of Sylt, where nitrate is depleted during summer months.

N2 production in the Meldorf Bight sediments were consistently detected at higher rates (58-130<c2><a0><ce><bc>mol<c2><a0>N2<c2><a0>m^sup -2^<c2><a0>h^sup -1^ in the very fine sand station and between 14 and 30<c2><a0><ce><bc>mol N2<c2><a0>m^sup -2^<c2><a0>h^sup -1^ in the medium sand station). Analysis of ancillary parameters suggests that major factors controlling N2 production in coastal sediments of the German Wadden Sea are the nitrate concentrations in the overlying water, the ambient temperature, and the organic matter content of the sediment. Extrapolating our spot measurements to the zone of nitrate availability and sediment types, we estimate an annual nitrogen removal rate around 16 kt N<c2><a0>year^sup -1^ for the entire northern sector of the German Wadden Sea area. This corresponds to 14% of the annual Elbe river nitrogen load.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Food Web Structure of the Alaskan Nearshore Shelf and Estuarine Lagoons of the Beaufort Sea},
abstract={Issue Title: Special Section: The Arctic Ocean Estuary The eastern Alaska Beaufort Sea coast is characterized by numerous shallow (2-5<c2><a0>m) estuarine lagoons, fed by streams and small rivers that drain northward from the Brooks Range through the arctic coastal plain, and bounded seaward by barrier islands and shoals. Millions of birds from six continents nest and forage during the summer period in this region using the river deltas, lagoons, and shoreline along with several species of anadromous and marine fish. We examined biogeochemical processes linking the benthic community to the overall food web structure of these poorly studied but pristine estuaries, which are largely covered by 1.8<c2><a0>m of ice for 10<c2><a0>months annually. In summer, these lagoons are relatively warm with brackish salinities (5-10<c2><b0>C, S=10-25) compared to more open coastal waters (0-5<c2><b0>C, S>27). The stable isotopic composition of organic materials in sediments (i.e., benthic particulate organic matter) and water column suspended particulate organic matter from both streams and lagoons are largely indistinguishable and reflect strong terrestrial contributions, based upon <ce><b4>^sup 13^C and <ce><b4>^sup 15^N values (-25.6[per thousand] to -27.4[per thousand] and 1.4[per thousand] to 3.3[per thousand], respectively). By comparison, shifts toward more heavy isotope-enriched organic materials reflecting marine influence are observed on the adjacent coastal shelf (-24.8[per thousand] to -25.4[per thousand] and 3.4[per thousand] to 5.3[per thousand], respectively). The isotopic composition of lagoon fauna is consistent with a food web dominated by omnivorous detritovores strongly dependent on microbial processing of terrestrial sources of carbon. Biomagnification of ^sup 15^N in benthic organisms indicate that the benthic food web in lagoons support up to four trophic levels, with carnivorous gastropod predators and benthic fishes (<ce><b4>^sup 15^N values up to 14.4[per thousand]) at the apex.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Arsenic toxicity in a sediment-dwelling polychaete: detoxification and arsenic metabolism},
abstract={The accumulation, subcellular distribution and speciation of arsenic in the polychaete Arenicola marina were investigated under different laboratory exposure conditions representing a range of metal bioavailabilities, to gain an insight into the physiological mechanisms of how A. marina handles bioaccumulated arsenic and to improve our understanding of the potential ecotoxicological significance of bioaccumulated arsenic in this deposit-feeder. The exposure conditions included exposure to sublethal concentrations of dissolved arsenate, exposure to sublethal concentrations of sediment-bound metal mining mixtures, and exposure to lethal concentrations of sediment-bound metal mining mixtures and arsenic- and multiple metal-spiked sediments. The sub-lethal exposures indicate that arsenic bioaccumulated by the deposit-feeding polychaete A. marina is stored in the cytosol as heat stable proteins (~50%) including metallothioneins, possibly as As (III)-thiol complexes. The remaining arsenic is mainly accumulated in the fraction containing cellular debris (~20%), with decreasing proportions accumulated in the metal-rich granules, organelles and heat-sensitive proteins fractions. A biological detoxified metal compartment including heat stable proteins and the fraction containing metal-rich granules is capable of binding arsenic coming into the cells at a constant rate under sublethal arsenic bioavailabilities. The remaining arsenic entering the cell is bound loosely into the cellular debris fraction, which can be subsequently released and diverted to an expanding detoxified pool. Our results suggest that a metal sensitive compartment comprising the cellular debris, enzymes and organelles fractions may be more representative of the toxic effects observed.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Hemocytes mediate a series of immune reactions essential for bivalve survival in the environment, however, the impact of harmful algal species and their associated phycotoxins upon bivalve immune system is under debate. To better understand the possible toxic effects of these toxins, Crassostrea gigas hemocytes were exposed to brevetoxin (PbTx-2). Hemocyte viability, monitored through the neutral red retention and MTT reduction assays, and apoptosis (Hoechst staining) remained unchanged during 12 h of exposure to PbTx-2 in concentrations up to 1000 <c2><b5>g/L. Despite cell viability and apoptosis remained stable, hemocytes incubated for 4 h with 1000 <c2><b5>g/L of PbTx-2 revealed higher expression levels of Hsp70 (p < 0.01) and CYP356A1 ( p < 0.05) transcripts and a tendency to increase FABP expression, as evaluated by Real-Time quantitative PCR. The expression of other studied genes (BPI, IL-17, GSTO, EcSOD, Prx6, SOD and GPx) remained unchanged. The results suggest that the absence of cytotoxic effects of PbTx-2 in Crassostrea gigas hemocytes, even at high concentrations, allow early defense responses to be produced by activating protective mechanisms associated to detoxification (CYP356A1 and possibly FABP) and stress (Hsp70), but not to immune or to antioxidant (BPI, IL-17, EcSOD, Prx6, GPx and SOD) related genes.},

title={Cross-shelf thermal variability in southern Lake Michigan during the stratified periods: [1]},
abstract={Results from a field experiment in southern Lake Michigan are used to quantify the cross-shelf nearshore variability in Great Lakes temperatures during the stratified season. The experiment was conducted along the Indiana coast of southern Lake Michigan, with temperature and velocity moorings arranged in a cross-shelf transect that extended to approximately 20 km from shore (40 m depth). The field site is noteworthy because of its location at the end of a major axis of an elliptical Great Lake, the relatively mild bathymetric slope, and local shoreline orientation that is perpendicular relative to the dominant summer winds. Measurements demonstrate that the location of the thermocline-bottom intersection is highly variable, causing a wide zone of extreme thermal variability in the nearshore region with time scales of variability ranging from hours to months. Near-inertial internal Poincar<c3><a9> waves are shown to cause large thermocline excursions but primarily only during periods of elevated activity. Several full upwelling events were observed, but in general, they were brief, lasting only 1-2 days, and had very limited spatial extent (2.5 km or less). Nonetheless, the offshore extent of the upwelling front was shown to be reasonably estimated with a simple estimate of the cross-shelf transport caused by alongshore wind events. A persistent feature that determined the zone of elevated thermal variability (the thermocline-shelf intersection point) was the strongly tilted thermocline, which resulted in the thermocline being located very close to shore. No evidence was found to support the hypothesis that internal Kelvin waves affect thermal variability at the study location.},

abstract={Issue Title: Evolution and Biodiversity in Ancient Lakes - Proceedings of the 5th Symposium on Speciation in Ancient Lakes, Ohrid, Macedonia, September 7-11, 2009 Ancient Lake Ohrid is characterized by vertical (bathymetrical) zones within the lake, presumably promoting allopatric speciation due to barriers or parapatric speciation along gradients. Examples within the lake include the belt of Chara algae as well as the shell zone, both presumably impeding migrations of benthic invertebrates. Three potential cases of vertical differentiation leading to distinct depth forms have been reported for the gastropod subfamily Pyrgulinae (Caenogastropoda: Hydrobiidae): Ginaia munda ssp., Macedopyrgula spp. and Ochridopyrgula macedonica ssp. Based on DNA data of the COI gene from a total of 145 specimens, this article aims at investigating the vertical differentiation within these depth forms and thus patterns of speciation in Lake Ohrid. An initial morphometric analysis showed a clear correlation of shell shape and collecting depth for Ginaia munda ssp. and Macedopyrgula spp. This morphological trend is largely reflected in the genetic structure of the respective taxa. The data presented here indicate the existence of strong gradients of abiotic and biotic factors in Lake Ohrid rather than distinct barriers. Therefore, parapatric speciation may be the predominant form of differentiation of benthic invertebrates in the lake. Incomplete lineage sorting, hybridization and phenotypic plasticity possibly caused by epigenetic mechanisms are discussed as possible reasons for the incongruence between geno- and phenotype observed in few specimens of Ginaia munda ssp. and Macedopyrgula spp. For the third taxon, Ochridopyrgula macedonica ssp., morphometric and genetic analyses revealed only weak support for the previously proposed depth forms. However, a horizontal differentiation of lake and spring populations was revealed instead, and parapatric and allopatric differentiations are discussed in this taxon.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Metal concentrations in urban riparian sediments along an urbanization gradient},
abstract={Urbanization impacts fluvial systems via a combination of changes in sediment chemistry and basin hydrology. While chemical changes in urban soils have been well characterized, similar surveys of riparian sediments in urbanized areas are rare. Metal concentrations were measured in sediments collected from riparian areas across the urbanization gradient in Baltimore, MD. Average metal concentrations are similar to those observed in other regional studies. Two important spatial patterns are evident in the data. First, calcium concentrations double across the urbanization gradient, regardless of changes in underlying geochemistry at the boundary between the Eastern US Piedmont and Coastal Plain physiographic provinces. Alkali-earth metal ratios indicate that the additional Ca is very pure and possibly arises from cement common to urban systems. Second, hot spots of trace metals typically associated with urban systems (e.g., Cu, Zn, and Pb) occur in areas that have been artificially filled to create additional real estate in high land value areas. Together, these data indicate that riparian sediments exhibit unexpected patterns of metal contamination. If these sediments are remobilized, during events such as droughts or floods, this contamination may perpetuate legacy impacts to ecosystem health from a history of fluvial contamination.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Hemocytes from controls and exposed clams were collected, and the effects of TCS on total hemocyte count (THC), hemocyte diameter and volume, uptake of the vital dye Neutral Red (an indicator of pinocytosis), lysozyme activity, and proliferation were evaluated. The cytotoxicity, which was evaluated using the lactate dehydrogenase assay, and the capability of TCS to induce DNA fragmentation, which indicated apoptosis, were also investigated. The exposure of clams to all tested TCS concentrations significantly decreased THC, whereas the highest tested TCS concentration significantly reduced the diameter and volume of hemocytes. TCS negatively affected pinocytosis and the proliferation of hemocytes, but it did not alter hemocyte lysozyme activity. TCS exerted cytotoxic effects and induced DNA fragmentation in hemocytes of R. philippinarum. Overall, these results suggest a relationship between TCS exposure and changes in the measured immune parameters and indicate immunosuppression in TCS-treated clams.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Retrospective qualitative analysis of ecological networks under environmental perturbation: a copper-polluted intertidal community as a case study},
abstract={The coast of Cha<c3><b1>aral Bay in northern Chile has been affected by copper mine wastes for decades. This sustained perturbation has disrupted the intertidal community in several ways, but the mechanisms behind the observed shifts in local biodiversity remain poorly understood. Our main goal was to identify the species (lumped into trophic groups) belonging to the Cha<c3><b1>aral intertidal community that, being directly affected by copper pollution, contributed primarily to the generation of the observed changes in community structure. These groups of species were called initiators. We applied a qualitative modelling approach based only on the sign and direction of effects among species, and present a formula for predicting changes in equilibrium abundances considering stress on multiple variables simultaneously. We then applied this technique retrospectively to identify the most likely set of initiators. Our analyses allowed identification of a unique set of four initiators in the studied intertidal system (a group of algae, sessile invertebrates, a group of herbivores and starfish), which were hypothesized to be the primary drivers of the observed changes in community structure. In addition, a hypothesis was derived about how the perturbation affected these initiators. The hypothesis is that pollution affected negatively the population growth rate of both algae and sessile invertebrates and suppressed the interaction between herbivores and starfish. Our analytic approach, focused on identifying initiators, constitutes an advance towards understanding the mechanisms underlying human-driven ecosystem disruption and permits identifying species that may serve as a focal point for community management and restoration.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Acute toxicity of 1-methyl-3-octylimidazolium bromide ([C^sub 8^mim]Br) to goldfish at different developmental stages and responses of the antioxidant system in adult goldfish were evaluated in the present study. The results indicate that post-embryonic developmental toxicity of [C^sub 8^mim]Br on goldfish is developmental-stage dependent. The juvenile and larva goldfish are more sensitive to [C^sub 8^mim]Br-toxicity than the adult fish. Histological observations in adult goldfish reveal that acute [C^sub 8^mim]Br exposure damages the hepatopancreas, intestines, and kidneys, indicating that these are possible target organs of [C^sub 8^mim]Br toxicity in goldfish. Subsequent biochemical assays in adult goldfish show that [C^sub 8^mim]Br also induces changes in the activities of the superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione content of fish hepatopancreas. These results suggest that [C^sub 8^mim]Br exposure may induce oxidant stress and lipid peroxidation in hepatopancreas of adult goldfish. In addition, we also find that [C^sub 8^mim]Br causes a remarkable increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in the hepatopancreas of adult goldfish, and thus we think that the MDA level change can be a biomarker of [C^sub 8^mim]Br toxicity in goldfish. The present study indicates that ionic liquids can be a threat to the survival, growth, and development of the fish population once they are accidentally leaked into aquatic ecosystems.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Energy intake and allocation are mainly used to maintain body functions, such as locomotion, growth, and reproductive output. It has been observed that environmental pollutants can affect the energy allocation either due to a cost of handling toxicants or because the toxicant interacts with the storage processes within the organisms. Less than a handful of studies are available reporting the effect of toxicants on energy reserves in enchytraeids and no studies have dealt with the influence of nanomaterials. The present paper shows results on the basal energy reserves (lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins) in Enchytraeus albidus and the influence of copper (Cu) salt and Cu nanoparticles on these reserves for two exposure durations. The energy allocation levels follow what has been reported for other worm species, although lower carbohydrate levels were observed. There were clear differences between worms exposed to control soils and those exposed to Cu for 3<c2><a0>weeks, but no difference after 6 weeks exposure. There was no apparent difference between the impacts of the two Cu exposure forms.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

The colonies were exposed for 6<c2><a0>h to each treatment, using phosphoric acid and NaOH to set water pH to the desired acidic or basic levels, respectively. Colonies of C. caspia displayed 100% mortality only at pH 4 and 10, and showed high survival rates (>50%) within the pH range of 5.0-8.5. The species demonstrated tolerance to a wide range of pH levels, and the results will help in the development of techniques to reduce biofouling by this species. Treatments that keep the pH below 5 or above 8.5 for at least 6<c2><a0>h are suggested to control and eradicate C. caspia where fouling causes significant economic impacts.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={While gradual allometric changes of shells are intrinsically driven by genotype, morphometrical shifts can also be modulated by local environmental conditions. Consequently the common use of a unique dimension (usually length) to assess bivalves' growth may mask phenotypic differences in valve shape among populations. A morphometric exhaustive study was conducted on Manila clam, Ruditapes philippinarum, by acquiring data in the French Arcachon Bay (intrasite phenotypic variability) and by comparing with other sites in the literature (intersite phenotypic variability). 2070 shells were subsampled, weighted, and automatically measured using TNPC software. Some ratios' values indicate a relatively round and globular shape shell in comparison with other sites confirming poor conditions for some individuals. Among adult clams, three main morphological groups were identified and discussed according to spatial considerations. Allometric relations for pairs of shell descriptors were determined by testing classical linear and piecewise regression models on log-transformed relation of Huxley. A significant shape change correlated to size was observed; it corresponds to the second year of life of the clam. Relationships between density, disease, and shell shape are demonstrated and discussed related to other potential factors affecting shell shape. Finally, consequences on population regulation are addressed.},

abstract={In this study I investigated the seasonal occurrence of microzooplankton in the gut of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas. Gut contents consisted of various microzooplankton, including tintinnid ciliates, dinoflagellates (Dinophysis spp.), copepods, copepod nauplii, bivalve larvae, and rotifers. Monthly variations in the abundance of protists (tintinnids and Dinophysis spp.) in the gut contents were significantly correlated with the variation in their abundances in the surrounding seawater, whereas this relationship was not significant with metazoans (copepods, copepod nauplii, and bivalve larvae). In laboratory experiments, oysters actively fed on ciliates. When oysters fed on ciliates labeled with a stable nitrogen isotope (^sup 15^N), the ^sup 15^N:total N ratio of the oyster tissues was significantly higher than that for oysters under a no-food condition, suggesting that oysters assimilate nitrogen of the ciliates into their body tissues. Based on these results, I conclude that microzooplankton forms an important food source for oysters, especially when other food sources such as phytoplankton are not abundant.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={On Factors Controlling Air-Water Gas Exchange in a Large Tidal River},
abstract={Air-water gas exchange is an important process in aquatic systems, including tidal rivers and estuaries. While there are now reliable and routine methods for determining gas exchange over a range of temporal and spatial scales in the ocean and these measurements have resulted in widely used wind speed parameterizations to calculate air-sea gas exchange, the same has not been true for coastal inland waterways. Some studies have suggested that this difference is methodological, while others point to the existence of additional drivers for gas exchange besides wind in rivers and estuaries. Here, we present gas transfer velocities measured in the tidal Hudson River with a method widely used in oceanic studies, the ^sup 3^He/SF^sub 6^ dual tracer technique. Airside and waterside forcings were determined with an anemometer and an acoustic Doppler current profiler, respectively. The results confirm that wind is the dominant driver of gas exchange in the tidal Hudson River, with negligible contribution from bottom-generated turbulence. Furthermore, a parameterization between wind speed and gas exchange developed for the ocean is able to predict gas exchange in this environment with high accuracy. It is hoped that by transferring methodology used in oceanic studies to rivers and estuaries, robust data can be obtained that will eventually allow development of widely applicable relationships between easily measured environmental variables and gas exchange in tidal inland waters.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Water quality assessment by means of HFNI valvometry and high-frequency data modeling},
abstract={The high-frequency measurements of valve activity in bivalves (e.g., valvometry) over a long period of time and in various environmental conditions allow a very accurate study of their behaviors as well as a global analysis of possible perturbations due to the environment. Valvometry uses the bivalve's ability to close its shell when exposed to a contaminant or other abnormal environmental conditions as an alarm to indicate possible perturbations in the environment. The modeling of such high-frequency serial valvometry data is statistically challenging, and here, a nonparametric approach based on kernel estimation is proposed. This method has the advantage of summarizing complex data into a simple density profile obtained from each animal at every 24-h period to ultimately make inference about time effect and external conditions on this profile. The statistical properties of the estimator are presented. Through an application to a sample of 16 oysters living in the Bay of Arcachon (France), we demonstrate that this method can be used to first estimate the normal biological rhythms of permanently immersed oysters and second to detect perturbations of these rhythms due to changes in their environment. We anticipate that this approach could have an important contribution to the survey of aquatic systems. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={The characteristics of automobile catalyst-derived platinum group elements in road dusts and roadside soils: a case study in the Pearl River Delta region, South China},
abstract={Issue Title: Special Issue: Environmental Problems and Solutions in China The emission of platinum group elements (PGE) from automobile catalytic converters has led to enrichment of PGE in road dusts and roadside soils in urban areas that are well above the natural background levels. This paper evaluates the source of contamination of all the PGE and Au in road dusts and roadside soils in the Pearl River Delta region, including three major cities, Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Hong Kong, South China. Samples were digested using Carius tube and analyzed by isotope dilution ICP-MS; Os was separated by distillation and other PGE by Te-coprecipitation. All samples have elevated PGE concentrations above the background values of uncontaminated soils and contain higher Pt, Pd and Rh than other PGE. The maximum values are 181<c2><a0>ng/g Pt, 514<c2><a0>ng/g Pd, 53<c2><a0>ng/g Rh and 1345<c2><a0>ng/g Au. There are clear positive correlations between Pt and Pd, Pt and Rh, and Pd and Rh, indicating that the main emitted of PGE from automobile catalyst are Pt, Pd and Rh. High concentrations of Au were also found in road dust samples from Hong Kong and Shenzhen. Dust samples with higher Os contents have lower ^sup 187^Os/^sup 188^Os ratios. Samples from Hong Kong show relatively high Pt/Rh ratios. Positive correlations between Pt and Ru, and Pt and Ir were found in Shenzhen and Hong Kong, but only positive correlations between Pt and Ir were found in Guangzhou. These different characteristics reflect different automobile catalytic systems used in Hong Kong and mainland China.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Current concentrations and spatial and temporal trends in mercury in Great Lakes Herring Gull eggs, 1974-2009},
abstract={Issue Title: Special Issue: Mercury in the Great Lakes Current concentrations and spatial and temporal trends of total mercury (Hg) were assessed in eggs of the Herring Gull (Larus argentatus) over the period 1974-2009 at 15 sites in the Great Lakes: 2-3 sites per lake and one site in each of 3 connecting channels. Current (2009) concentrations ranged from 0.064<c2><a0><ce><bc>g/g (wet weight) at Chantry Island (Lake Huron) to 0.246<c2><a0><ce><bc>g/g at Middle Island (Lake Erie). There were significant inter-colony differences in mean Hg concentrations (2005-2009). Mercury concentrations at 14 of 15 sites declined from 23 to 86% between when it was first measured (usually 1974) and 2009. Declining temporal trends over the entire period (1974-2009) were significant at 10 of the 15 sites. On the other hand, there were no significant trends in mercury over the last 15<c2><a0>years. In the early years, declines of Hg in Herring Gull eggs tracked those in Rainbow Smelt (Osmerus mordax) in most Great Lakes. More recently, declines in gull eggs were more evident than in smelt and may be partially explained by temporal changes in the gull diet. When gull Hg data were adjusted for temporal changes in the gull diet, as inferred from stable nitrogen isotope values in eggs, significant declines in egg mercury levels were found only at 4 of 15 sites. Overall, Hg concentrations have declined in Great Lakes Herring Gull eggs over the period 1974-2009 but changes in the gull diet may be contributing, in part, to those declines. Examination of contaminant temporal trends in multiple indicator species will ensure accurate inferences regarding contaminant availability in the environment.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Stoichiometric relationship between suspension-feeding caddisfly (Trichoptera: Brachycentridae) and seston},
abstract={Organisms must acquire adequate amounts of carbon (C) and nutrients [i.e., nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P)] from their food to support growth. The growth of organisms can be constrained by consumer-resource elemental imbalances in C:nutrient ratios, especially in aquatic ecosystems. Furthermore, the elemental composition of aquatic organisms can change through ontogeny, which can impose additional challenges to growth (the growth rate hypothesis), terminal body size, and reproductive output. In streams, growth in larval aquatic insects is influenced primarily by food quality and quantity, temperature, and population density. We conducted a field study that tracked the growth of a common suspension-feeding caddisfly (Brachycentrus occidentalis) through its ontogeny by comparing the elemental composition (C:N:P) of the organism with its available food supply (suspended particulate organic matter or seston). Larvae and seston were sampled from four streams throughout 1 year. Differences in the growth of larvae among the streams were evident, even though the streams possessed similar thermal regimes. Spatial and temporal differences in the nutrient contents of B. occidentalis and seston were observed, suggesting a consumer-resource elemental imbalance. Lower C:P and N:P ratios in food were positively correlated to larval growth rate, suggesting growth was limited by P. The C, N, and P contents in B. occidentalis' body tissue did change throughout ontogeny. C:nutrient ratios varied across sites during larval development; however, inter-site variation decreased substantially as the populations approached pupation. Ultimately, consumer-resource elemental imbalances during the larval stage did not lead to differences in pre-emergent standing stocks across sites.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Diverse genetic biomarkers have been used to evaluate the effects of pollution by mutagenic agents such as metals and pesticides, as well as a large variety of chemical substances derived from human activities. This work researched the effects that an exposure of 60<c2><a0>days to the insecticide Fipronil (concentrations of 0.05, 0.10 and 0.23<c2><a0><ce><bc>g/L) can cause in the fish Rhamdia quelen using Comet assay with gills, histopathological analysis of gills and the Piscine Micronucleus test and Nuclear Morphological Alterations. The results for the Comet assay and for gills histopathological injuries showed no difference between the control group and the contaminated groups. In the Piscine Micronucleus test, the smallest concentration of Fipronil (0.05<c2><a0><ce><bc>g/L) was similar as the control group, while concentrations of 0.10 and 0.23<c2><a0><ce><bc>g/L caused more damage to the DNA. These results suggested that only the highest concentrations of Fipronil tested cause damage in erythrocytes, but none of these concentrations was sufficient to alter the DNA in the gill cells. R. quelen may be a less sensitive bioindicator than other fish that have been tested. On the other hand, the concentrations used may not have been sufficient to detect alterations in the DNA of R. quelen with the chosen tests. Works like this take on great importance given the enormous quantity of substances that are thrown daily into the environment in an uncontrolled way, without evaluation of the consequences. The application of these tests with other concentrations, tissues and exposure times is suggested for future works.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={A history of acid mine contamination, recovery, and eutrophication in Sandy Lake, Pennsylvania},
abstract={Sandy Lake, PA, was subject to acid mine contamination in the 1860s, which led to complete extirpation of fish. The mine effluent was soon diverted, but the watershed experienced continued deforestation, agricultural development, and population growth to the beginning of the twentieth century. Paleolimnological analyses of metals and diatoms clearly show the onset of acid mine drainage with rapid increases in concentrations of iron, manganese and sulfur, and decreases in diatom-inferred pH in the sedimentary profile, and a very rapid recovery following remediation. Diatom-inferred phosphorus suggests a period of oligotrophication following diversion of the acid mine drainage and reduction in lake catchment area. However, analyses of nutrients and algal pigments suggest continued eutrophication to the present in spite of increasing forest cover and a stable population over the last century. Pigments indicate a tenfold increase in phytoplankton, with cyanobacteria becoming a more significant portion of the biomass. Accumulation of sedimentary phosphorus has increased by a factor of 4 and sedimentary organic carbon by a factor of 5 since the mid-1800s.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in fish and crayfish from the Calumet region of southwestern Lake Michigan},
abstract={We identified and quantified polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in six aquatic taxa from the Calumet region of southwestern Lake Michigan in order to examine their differential exposure to and health risks from PAH. There was a high degree of variation in PAH concentrations across and within sites. Mean concentrations of total PAH were high in alewife (1,064<c2><a0>ng/g) and minnows (345<c2><a0>ng/g) collected from the Indiana Ship Canal, when compared to other taxa and locations. Concentrations of PAH in sunfish were relatively low (10 to 79<c2><a0>ng/g), even where environmental concentrations were elevated. In sunfish, regardless of location, concentrations of CHR, FLA, FLU, PHE and PYR were high whereas DBA, IPE, BAP, BBF, BGP and BKF concentrations were low. PAH concentrations in crayfish exceeded those of other taxa at three of four locations where they co-occurred. PAH profiles were similar in crayfish, sunfish and minnows from locations where sediment concentrations were low. Profiles for crayfish and minnows from a location where sediment concentrations were elevated displayed lower concentrations of ACY, and higher concentrations of BAA, BBF, and BKF, than those from the other three locations. In contrast, the profiles in sunfish from those three locations were similar. The PHE/ANT and FLA/PYR ratios for crayfish, minnows and sunfish suggested that the primary sources at most locations were pyrogenic, although some sites had strong petrogenic influences. Toxic equivalency factors in biota generally reflected the magnitude of sediment contamination. In three of four locations where they co-occurred, TEQs were higher in crayfish than in sunfish and minnows. Sunfish had higher TEQs than minnows at most, though not all, locations; TEQs were notably higher in minnows as compared to sunfish from the Little Calumet River. The selection of aquatic species as sentinels of PAH exposure and risks needs to consider differences in ecologies of taxa as well as the relative magnitude of sediment contamination.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Acute toxic effects and mechanisms of two typical endocrine disrupting chemicals, nonylphenols (NPs) and bisphenol A (BPA), to the embryonic development of the abalone Haliotis diversicolor supertexta, were investigated by the two-stage embryo toxicity test. The 12-h median effective concentrations (EC^sub 50^) of NPs and BPA to the trochophore development were 1016.22 and 30.72<c2><a0><ce><bc>g<c2><a0>L^sup -1^, respectively, and the respective 96-h EC^sub 50^ values based on the completion of metamorphosis (another experimental endpoint) were reduced to 11.65 and 1.02<c2><a0><ce><bc>g<c2><a0>L^sup -1^. Longer exposure time and magnified exposure concentrations in the benthic diatom, that serves as both food source and settlement substrate during the metamorphosis, via bioaccumulation, led to the higher sensitivity of metamorphosis to target EDCs compared with the trochophore development. The hazard concentrations for 5% of the species (HC^sub 5^) could be employed as the safety thresholds for the embryonic development of the abalone. The 12-h HC^sub 5^ values of NPs and BPA were 318.68 and 13.93<c2><a0><ce><bc>g<c2><a0>L^sup -1^, respectively, and the respective 96-h HC^sub 5^ values were 0.99 and 0.18<c2><a0><ce><bc>g<c2><a0>L^sup -1^, which were at environmentally relevant levels. Results of proteomic responses revealed that NPs and BPA altered various functional proteins in the abalone larvae with slight differences between each chemical and affected various physiological functions, such as energy and substance metabolism, cell signalling, formation of cytoskeleton and cilium, immune and stress responses at the same time, leading to the failure of metamorphosis.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Evolutionary diversification of the broadly distributed copepod sibling species complex Eurytemora affinis has been documented in the northern hemisphere. However, the fine scale geographic distribution, levels of genetic subdivision, evolutionary, and demographic histories of European populations have been less explored. To gain information on genetic subdivision and to evaluate heterogeneity among European populations, we analyzed samples from 8 locations from 58<c2><b0> to 45<c2><b0>N and 0<c2><b0> to 23<c2><b0>E, using 549 base pairs of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene. We discovered three distinct lineages of E. affinis in Western Europe, namely the East Atlantic lineage, the North Sea/English Channel (NSEC) lineage, and the Baltic lineage. These geographically separated lineages showed sequences divergence of 1.7-2.1%, dating back 1.9 million years (CI: 0.9-3.0 My) with no indication of isolation by distance. Genetic divergence in Europe was much lower than among North American lineages. Interestingly, genetic structure varied distinctively among the three lineages: the East Atlantic lineage was divided between the Gironde and the Loire populations, the NSEC lineage comprised one single population unit spanning the Seine, Scheldt and Elbe rivers and the third lineage was restricted to the Baltic Proper (Sweden). We revealed high haplotype diversity in the East Atlantic and the Baltic lineages, whereas in the NSEC lineage haplotype diversity was comparatively low. All three lineages showed signs of at least one demographic expansion event during Pleistocene glaciations that marked their genetic structure. These results provide a preliminary overview of the genetic structure of E. affinis in Europe.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

The comet assay and the antioxidant enzyme approach were used to test the potential toxicity of water samples on the microalgae Euglena gracilis. Total concentrations of 25 organic pollutants in samples from two sites were 6.700 and 14.655<c2><a0><ce><bc>g/l, respectively, with a calculated total ambient severity (TAS) of less than 1 and therefore minimal risk to human and ecological health. Organic extracts from the samples at these two sites was found to induce dose-dependent DNA damage on microalgae cells. DNA damage together with changes in superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) activities indicated that the potential pollutant toxicity was far higher at one of the two sites than at the other site. The comet assay combined with the activities of antioxidant enzymes may be of value as a biomarker for presence of organic pollutants in drinking water sources.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Although invertebrates are recognized by the great facility to accumulate pollutants present in their environment and many of them are used as sentinel species in biomonitoring studies, little is known about the impact of toxicants on the immune system of these animals. In this regard, hemocytes play a fundamental role: these cells circulate freely through the hemolymph of invertebrates and act on the recognition of foreign material to the organism, mediating and effecting the cellular defense, such as phagocytosis, nodulation, and encapsulation. Different morphological types can be recognized but still there is controversy among the researchers about the exact classification of the hemocytes due to the diversity of techniques for the preservation and observation of these cells. In the present study, a review on the main hemocyte responses to environmental stress in different invertebrate organisms is presented, emphasizing the contamination by heavy metals. It is discussed parameters such as: alteration in the number of cells involved in the defense reaction, phagocytic activity, lysosomal responses, and production of reactive oxygen species.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

For each salinity set-up, two sediment groups were used: an unmodified natural sediment and the same supplemented with Ulva lattuca, an assumed important natural dietary item. The results obtained showed the following: (1) Salinity changes produce an immediate and significant effect on growth; (2) no significant differences were noted between the two groups subjected to different diets, but a significant interaction was noted between each of the two factors. Results of this study can have significant implications for M. sanguinea aquaculture, concerning farm site selection and salinity maintenance in order to maximize commercial productivity.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Microcystin-LR (MCLR) and linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS) are present widely in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, but their combined ecotoxicological risk is unknown. This study investigated the toxic effects of MCLR, LAS and their mixture on lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) and evaluated MCLR accumulation level in lettuce with or without LAS. The changes in seed germination and shoot/root growth, responses of the antioxidative defense system, and the accumulation of MCLR in lettuce were tested to evaluate the single and combined toxic effect of MCLR and LAS in well-controlled conditions. The results showed that seedling growth (except for root elongation and leaf weight) was more sensitive to toxicant exposure than seed germination. For seedling leaves, lipid peroxidation was not observed when the antioxidative defense system (including superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione) was activated to relieve the adverse effects of oxidative stress via different pathways. Our results also confirmed that the interaction between MCLR and LAS was synergistic. Both toxicants in combination not only significantly inhibited seedling growth, but also increased the activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase, as well as the contents of glutathione. Furthermore, LAS dramatically enhanced the accumulation of MCLR in the plant, thus leading to a reduction in quality and yield and posing greater potential risk to humans via consumption of these edible plants.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Periphyton was grown on plastic membranes immersed in indoor aquaria contaminated with metals at realistic contamination levels (0.3, 3<c2><a0><ce><bc>g/l for Cd, 5, 50<c2><a0><ce><bc>g/l for Ni, 20, 200<c2><a0><ce><bc>g/l for Zn). After 3<c2><a0>weeks of exposure, biofilms' parameters (dry-weight, chlorophyll a concentration, heterotrophic activity) were analyzed and tolerance acquisition of the heterotrophic communities was assessed using the toxicity test. Modifications of bacterial and eukaryotic community structure were assessed with Automated Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis (ARISA). Effects of metal exposure were observed on biofilms parameters in the Cd and Zn experiments. Tolerance levels increased for both Cd-exposed biofilms, and for the high metal treatment biofilms in the Ni and Zn experiments. Analysis of the ARISA profiles showed that metal exposure affected the structure of both bacterial and eukaryotic communities. Moreover, Cd tolerance of the Zn-exposed heterotrophic communities was evaluated, which showed that the Zn-tolerant community (high metal treatment in the Zn experiment) also became tolerant to Cd (co-tolerance). The study shows that tolerance acquisition can be detected after exposure to environmental metal concentrations using <ce><b2>-glucosidase activity as an endpoint in short-term toxicity tests.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={The purpose of this study was to link toxicokinetics/toxicodynamics and subcellular partitioning for assessing the susceptibility and the growth inhibition risks of abalone Haliotis diversicolor supertexta exposed to waterborne and foodborne cadmium (Cd) and silver (Ag). We reanalyzed published data on growth inhibition and subcellular partitioning associated with the present mechanistic model to explore the correlations among elimination (k ^sub e^), detoxification (k ^sub d^), and recovery (k ^sub r^) rate constants and to assess the growth inhibition risk. We found a positive correlation among k ^sub e^, k ^sub d^, and k ^sub r^ in abalone exposed to Ag. We also employed a life-stage based probabilistic assessment model to estimate the growth inhibition risk of abalone to environmentally relevant Cd (5-995<c2><a0><ce><bc>g<c2><a0>l^sup -1^) and Ag (0.05-9.95<c2><a0><ce><bc>g<c2><a0>l^sup -1^) concentrations in Taiwan. The results showed that abalone had a minimum 20% probability of the growth inhibition risk exposed to Cd, whereas Ag exposure was not likely to pose the risk. The maximum biomasses were estimated to be 0.0039 and 0.0038, 61.61 and 43.87, and 98.88 and 62.97<c2><a0>g for larvae, juveniles, and adults of abalone exposed to the same levels of Cd and Ag, respectively.

Suspended solids were greatest in spring and summer and were correlated to river discharge. Mean annual nitrogen concentrations increased from 1986 to 1995 and then decreased from 1996 to 2002. Unlike nitrogen, phosphorus concentrations (both phosphates and total phosphorus) gradually increased throughout the study period changing the river from an oligotrophic to upper mesotrophic status. If this trend continues phytoplankton could become nitrogen-limited leading to the development of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterial blooms. No obvious relation between fertiliser usage over the Rostovskaya Oblast and nutrient dynamic patterns was identified, probably because only 10% of the water in the river comes from this area. The reason for the unusual and contradictory nitrogen and phosphorus changes remain largely unknown for this regulated river.},

title={Character of Shell Beds Flanking Herod Point Shoal, Southeastern Long Island Sound, New York},
abstract={High biogenic productivity, strong tidal currents, shoal topography, and short transport distances combine to favor shell-bed formation along the lower flanks of a cape-associated shoal off Herod Point on Long Island, New York. This shell bed has a densely packed, clast-supported fabric composed largely of undegraded surf clam (Spisula solidissima) valves. It is widest along the central part of the western flank of the shoal where topographic gradients are steep and a stronger flood tide results in residual flow. The bed is narrower and thinner toward the landward margins where currents are too weak to transport larger valves and topographic gradients are gentle, limiting bed-load transport mechanisms by which the shells are concentrated. Reconnaissance mapping off Roanoke Point suggests that shell beds are also present at the other cape-associated shoals off northeastern Long Island, where relatively similar geomorphic and oceanographic conditions exist. These shell beds are important to the Long Island Sound ecosystem because they provide complex benthic habitats of rough and hard substrates at the boundary between the muddy basin floor and mobile sand of the shoals.

abstract={Issue Title: Special Issue on Evolutionary Process in Ecotoxicology Climate change is expected to result in an increased occurrence of heat stress. The long-term population-level impact of this stress would be lessened in populations able to genetically adapt to higher temperatures. Adaptation requires the presence of genetically-based variation. At-risk populations may undergo strong declines in population size that lower the amount of genetic variation. The objectives of this study were to quantify the heritability of heat tolerance in populations of the least killifish, Heterandria formosa, and to determine if heritabilities were reduced following a population bottleneck. Heritabilities of heat tolerance were determined for two lines of each of two source populations; two bottlenecked lines (established with one pair of fish) and two regular lines. Heat tolerance was quantified as temperature-at-death (TAD), when fish acclimated at 28<c2><b0>C were subjected to an increase in water temperature of 2<c2><b0>C/day. Mid-parent/mean offspring regressions and full-sib analyses were used to estimate the heritability of TAD. Heritability estimates from parent/offspring regressions ranged from 0.185 to 0.462, while those from sib analyses ranged from 0 to 0.324, with an overall estimate of 0.203 (0.230 for the regular lines, 0.168 for bottlenecked ones). Fish from the bottlenecked line from one source population (but not the other) had a lower heritability than did those from the regular line. These results show that the populations tested had some potential for adaptation to elevated water temperatures, and that this potential may be reduced following a population bottleneck. This should not be construed as evidence that natural populations will not suffer negative consequences from global warming; this study only showed that these specific populations have some potential to adapt under a very specific set of conditions.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Increasing dissolved silica trends in the Rhine River: an effect of recovery from high P loads?},
abstract={The development of river dams and further human activities (causing increased nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) nutrient loads), are responsible for a decline in dissolved silica concentrations (DSi) in many river systems. Here, the impact of the reduction of N- and P-concentrations on DSi is examined for the Rhine River. During the last decade of the twentieth century, annual average DSi concentrations increased by ~70% in the Rhine at Bimmen/Lobith, whereas nitrate (NO3) and phosphate (PO^sub 4^) concentrations decreased by approximately one third. Accordingly, decadal changes in nutrient elemental ratios shifted the river system from DSi-limitation to P-limitation. Specifically, a seasonal DSi-concentration increase is observed from May to December for the Rhine River (with exception of June). Observed increases in DSi concentration are probably due to improvements in water-basin and land-use management, specifically a reduction in point-source P discharge, leading to P-limiting conditions for diatom growth. Data of the warm season suggest that as the system is moving through the transition from P-excess to P-limitation conditions, P-limitation according to the elemental ratio DSi/total phosphorus (TP) is occurring later than for the ratio DSi/PO^sub 4^-P. Latter ratio will be buffered around ~16:1 during growing season. Reduction of N fertilization is less relevant, as N-limitation with respect to DSi is not achieved, even at the end of the analyzed period, but N-limitation may be reached in the future. Analysis of discharge-DSi relationship supports the hypothesis that DSi increase is affected by increasing P-limitation during the warm period and not only due to hydrological reasons. Results suggest, however, that the influence of hydrological parameters needs to be addressed in research for DSi concentration changes due to changed nutrient loads. Despite an overall increase in water temperature of 3<c2><b0>C over a 50-year period, no correlation with temperature was found for the last two decades of the twentieth century, for which DSi-data were available. In conclusion, in case of eutrophied river systems with excess of P, P-reduction may lead to an increase of DSi concentrations under certain conditions. This in turn is expected to impact not only DSi-sensitive coastal-zone ecosystems impacted by eutrophication but the carbon cycle as well.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Human health risk assessment of environmental and dietary exposure to natural radionuclides in the Catalan stretch of the Ebro River, Spain},
abstract={This study was aimed at assessing the levels of ^sup 210^Pb and ^sup 210^Po concentrations as well as gross alpha and beta activities in environmental monitors from the Catalan stretch of the Ebro River (Spain), potentially influenced by the presence of sediments with high concentrations of ^sup 238^U and its decay chain daughters in the Flix reservoir. The chronic daily intake of ^sup 210^Pb and ^sup 210^Po through ingestion and inhalation of soils was evaluated, and the derived non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks were characterized. The low concentration of radioisotopes in soils resulted in a negligible annual effective dose. The levels of ^sup 210^Pb and ^sup 210^Po were determined in various groups of highly consumed food (fish and seafood, vegetables, fruits, and rice), and their dietary intake was calculated. The annual effective dose for the adult people from food intake was estimated in 3.3<c2><a0><c3><97><c2><a0>10^sup -2^<c2><a0>mSv, mostly due to ^sup 210^Po. Overall, the current radioactivity levels in the Catalan stretch of the Ebro River should not mean any additional health risk for the population living nearby. However, an integral assessment of the risks derived from exposure to other pollutants (e.g., metals and organochlorine compounds) jointly with radionuclides could be of great interest.

title={The impact of sediment deposition and iceberg scour on the Antarctic soft shell clam Laternula elliptica at King George Island, Antarctica},
abstract={Abstract Recent rapid changes of air temperature on the western side of the Antarctic Peninsula results in increased sediment discharge and ice scouring frequencies in coastal regions. These changes are bound to especially affect slow growing, sessile filter feeders such as the Antarctic bivalve, Laternula elliptica, a long-lived and abundant key species with circumpolar distribution. We investigated the effect of sedimentation and ice scouring on small/young and large/old individuals at two closely located stations, distinctly influenced by both types of disturbance. Small individuals dealt better with disturbance in terms of their respiratory response to sediment exposure, reburrowing ability, and survival after injury, compared to larger animals. At the more disturbed station L. elliptica population density was lower, but larger animals reburrowed faster after iceberg disturbance and reduced their metabolic rate under strong sediment coverage, compared to larger animals of the less disturbed station, indicating that an adaptation or learning response to both types of disturbance may be possible. Smaller individuals were not influenced. Laternula elliptica seems capable of coping with the rapidly changing environmental conditions. Due to a decrease in population density and mean population lifespan, L. elliptica could however lose its key role in the bentho-pelagic carbon flux in areas of high sediment deposition.

title={Comparative analysis of rotifer community structure in five subtropical shallow lakes in East China: role of physical and chemical conditions},
abstract={Worldwide, there have been few comparative studies on rotifer communities in subtropical lakes. We studied changes in rotifer community structure over 1<c2><a0>year and its relationship to several physicochemical variables in five subtropical shallow lakes in East China, covering a nutrient gradient from mesotrophy to moderate eutrophy. In these lakes, the genera Brachionus, Lecane, and Trichocerca dominated the rotifer species composition, and Polyarthra dolichoptera, Keratella cochlearis, Filinia longiseta, T. pusilla, and Anuraeopsis fissa were the dominant species. With increased nutrient loading, total rotifer abundance and species dominance increased, indicating that rotifer abundance might be a more sensitive indicator of trophic state than species composition. Comparative analyses of the six rotifer community indices calculated in this study and redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed that the two slightly eutrophic lakes and the other two moderately eutrophic lakes exhibited a high degree similarity in community structure. This suggests that the trophic state of a lake determines the rotifer community structure. In contrast, in the two moderately eutrophic lakes, the mass ratios of TN:TP and the contents of TP suggested N-limitation and cyanobacteria dominance in phytoplankton communities might be possible. In these lakes TN played a more important role in shaping the rotifer community according to stepwise multiple regression and RDA. RDA analysis also suggested that rotifer species distribution was strongly associated with trophic state and water temperature, with water temperature being the most important factor in determining seasonality.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={The watershed approach: Challenges, antecedents, and the transition from technical tool to governance unit},
abstract={Watersheds are a widely accepted scale for water governance activities. This paper makes three contributions to current understandings of watersheds as governance units. First, the paper collects recent research identifying some of the challenges associated with the policy framework understood as the watershed approach. These challenges are boundary choice, accountability, public participation, and watersheds' asymmetries with 'problem-sheds' and 'policy-sheds'. Second, the paper draws upon this synthesis and on a review of the development and evolution of the concept of watersheds to suggest that the challenges associated with the watershed approach are symptoms of a broader issue: that the concept of watersheds was developed as a technical tool but has been taken up as a policy framework. The result of this transition from tool to framework, the paper argues, has been the conflation of governance tools, hydrologic boundaries, and Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM). Third, the paper calls for an analysis of watersheds as separate from the governance tools with which they have been conflated, and presents three entry points into such an analysis.},

abstract={Biomarker responses in organisms exposed to copper were examined by comparing two gammarid species, Gammarus roeseli and Dikerogammarus villosus, based on gender. G. roeseli specimens were exposed to 20<c2><a0><ce><bc>g/L of copper for 6, 12, 24 and 48-h periods, while D. villosus were exposed to 20 and 30<c2><a0><ce><bc>g/L of copper for 12, 48 and 72<c2><a0>h. Males and females of each species were exposed separately and biomarker measurements were performed for each species and gender. The selected biomarkers were antioxidant enzymes as total glutathione peroxidase (GPxtot), selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase (SeGPx), and catalase activities. Malondialdehyde level (MDA) was measured as a biomarker of toxic effect. Energy reserves were evaluated by means of lipid, glycogen and protein levels. For both species and gender, antioxidant enzyme activities were weakly modified by copper exposure and differences were transient. MDA levels were increased in both species and genders in exposed animals compared to controls, when energy reserves were decreased. G. roeseli was more rapidly overwhelmed by copper toxicity while the first response of D. villosus was the mobilization of its energetic content. D. Villosus probably has specific physiological properties that enable it to cope with copper toxicity and thus become the best competitor.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Relative cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of a widely used antibiotic, trimethoprim (TRIMP) was evaluated under in vitro conditions using rainbow trout gonad-2 (RTG-2) and Chinese hamster ovary-K1 (CHO-K1) cells. Whilst cytotoxicity was determined using neutral red retention (NRR) assay, the genotoxicity was determined using single cell gel electrophoresis or the Comet assay and cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay. For NRR assay, concentration-dependent cytotoxic effect was observed for both the cell lines (estimated EC^sub 50^ values: 671.82<c2><a0><c2><b1><c2><a0>21.78 and 611.6<c2><a0><c2><b1><c2><a0>20.4<c2><a0><ce><bc>g<c2><a0>ml^sup -1^ for RTG-2 and CHO-K1 cells, respectively). There was no statistically significant difference between the two cell lines for this assay. For the Comet assay, standard 6<c2><a0>h exposure to TRIMP did not show any positive response for any of the cell types used. However, 48<c2><a0>h exposure to RTG-2 cells showed a concentration-dependent induction of DNA damage (r<c2><a0>=<c2><a0>0.86). The highest concentration of TRIMP used (i.e. 100<c2><a0><ce><bc>g<c2><a0>ml^sup -1^) showed relatively higher DNA damage, compared to ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS; 1<c2><a0><ce><bc>g<c2><a0>ml^sup -1^ or 8<c2><a0>mM), a reference genotoxic agent, used concurrently. In contrast, 24<c2><a0>h exposure time for CHO-K1 cells did not show any concentration-dependent increase for this assay. For MN assay, a significant correlation was found between the MN induction and TRIMP concentration for both the cell lines (RTG-2: r<c2><a0>=<c2><a0>0.68; CHO-K1: r<c2><a0>=<c2><a0>0.79), although only the highest concentration used showed a significant increase for binucleated (BN) cell with micronuclei (BNMN). The study suggests that whilst the cells of different origin could exhibit similar cytotoxicity, they could display differential genotoxic effects. Furthermore, genotoxic effects of TRIMP are primarily exposure period dependent phenomena and, in addition to inhibiting the action of dihydrofolate reductase, oxidative stress could also contribute for the observed toxic effects, fish cells in general being more sensitive for genotoxic effects.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={We quantified thiamine in eggs of Lake Erie walleye to determine if differences exist between spawning stocks within the Maumee and Sandusky rivers, both of which drain into the Western Basin. In spring 2004, eggs of walleye were collected in the Maumee River at three occasions (early, peak and late of the spawning run) and in the Sandusky River during the spawning run. After collection, eggs were fertilized with a known amount of milt, incubated and embryo survival was determined at the pigmented eyed stage. Thiamine and its derivatives were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography. Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) was the most abundant form of vitamin B^sub 1^ present in eggs (60-95% of the total vitamin B^sub 1^ concentration). Total thiamine concentrations in walleye eggs from the Maumee and Sandusky rivers at the peak of the spawning run averaged 6.1<c2><b1>1.6<c2><a0>nmolg^sup -1^ and 5.0<c2><b1>2.9<c2><a0>nmolg^sup -1^, respectively. Our results also indicated that Maumee River stock survival to the eyed stage embryo declined as the spawning season progressed (72%, 59% and 37% in the early, middle and late of spawning run, respectively) as well as the total thiamine and TPP concentrations. At the peak of the spawning run, survival to the eyed stage embryo did not differ significantly between stocks 59% versus 65% in the Maumee and Sandusky rivers, respectively, and thiamine concentrations were not significantly different between sites.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={This paper synthesizes a 3-year collaborative effort to characterize the biogeochemical and hydrological features of intensively managed agricultural catchments by combining data analysis, modeling, and preliminary hypothesis testing. The specific focus was on the Midwestern region of the United States. The results suggest that: (1) water management, specifically the homogenization of evapotranspiration losses driven by mono-cultural vegetation cover, and the homogenization of runoff generation driven by artificial drainage, has created engineered, predictable hydrologic systems; (2) nutrient and pesticide management, specifically their regular applications have created two kinds of biogeochemical export regimes: chemostatic (low variability in concentration as exhibited by nitrate) and episodic (high variability in concentration as exhibited by pesticides); (3) coupled mass-balance models for water and solutes reproduce these two regimes as a function of chemical rate constants. Phosphorus transport regimes were found to be episodic at smaller spatial scales, but chemostatic at larger scales. Chemostatic response dominates in transport-limited catchments that have internal sources of the solute to buffer the periodicity in episodic inputs, while episodic response dominates in source-limited catchments. The shift from episodic nitrate export in pristine catchments to chemostatic regimes in managed watersheds was attributed to legacy stores of nitrogen (built from continued fertilizer applications) that buffer interannual variations in biogeochemical processing. Fast degradation kinetics of pesticides prevents the build-up of legacy sources, and leads to episodic export. Analytical expressions were derived for the probability density functions of solute delivery ratio as a function of the stochastics of rainfall-runoff events and biogeochemical controls.},

title={An Impact Assessment Method of Dam/Sluice on Instream Ecosystem and its Application to the Bengbu Sluice of China},
abstract={A method is presented for impact evaluation of dams/sluices on their downstream aquatic ecosystems in the absence of detailed long-sequence ecology ecosystem data. It is based on the analysis of relations between indices of water quality and aquatic organisms. It can be applied to a river section absent of long-sequence ecology ecosystem data. For this study it was used to evaluate the effects of the Bengbu Sluice (BS), a typical sluice in the Huai River in China. Results indicate that in April and May the impact of BS on different downstream aquatic organisms varied. The most significant impact was on phytoplankton, with 91.7% of phytoplankton indices showing a 100% increase in quantity and biomass. The second most significant was on zooplankton, with 60.0% of zooplankton showing greater increase in quantity and biomass. The least significant impact was on zoobenthos, with only 33.3% showing greater increase in quantity and biomass. Most of these organisms have higher pollution-resistibility. These findings suggest that the present operation scheme will gradually lead to biodiversity decrease in the downstream aquatic ecology system, which will harm the instream aquatic ecology. Overall, BS has a negative impact on the downstream aquatic ecology system. It is argued that, in order to reduce the negative impact on the downstream aquatic ecology system, the operation of BS needs to be improved so that the discharge into the downstream river course is increased. Data comparison of the aquatic ecosystem condition between 1982 and 2006 also demonstrates the decreasing aquatic ecosystem quality downstream of BS.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Biogeochemical implications of climate change for tropical rivers and floodplains},
abstract={Large rivers of the tropics, many of which have extensive floodplains and deltas, are important in the delivery of nutrients and sediments to marine environments, in methane emission to the atmosphere and in providing ecosystem services associated with their high biological productivity. These ecosystem functions entail biogeochemical processes that will be influenced by climate change. Evidence for recent climate-driven changes in tropical rivers exists, but remains equivocal. Model projections suggest substantial future climate-driven changes, but they also underscore the complex interactions that control landscape water balances, river discharges and biogeochemical processes. The most important changes are likely to involve: (1) aquatic thermal regimes, with implications for thermal optima of plants and animals, rates of microbially mediated biogeochemical transformations, density stratification of water bodies and dissolved oxygen depletion; (2) hydrological regimes of discharge and floodplain inundation, which determine the ecological structure and function of rivers and floodplains and the extent and seasonality of aquatic environments; and (3) freshwater-seawater gradients where rivers meet oceans, affecting the distribution of marine, brackish and freshwater environments and the biogeochemical processing as river water approaches the coastal zone. In all cases, climate change affects biogeochemical processes in concert with other drivers such as deforestation and other land use changes, dams and other hydrological alterations and water withdrawals. Furthermore, changes in riverine hydrology and biogeochemistry produce potential feedbacks to climate involving biogeochemical processes such as decomposition and methane emission. Future research should seek improved understanding of these changes, and long-term monitoring should be extended to shallow waters of wetlands and floodplains in addition to the larger lakes and rivers that are most studied.

After 96<c2><a0>h of exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of fenitrothion, the swimming velocity and several biomarkers were individually determined, namely: brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity; muscle cholinesterases (ChE), lactate dehydrogenase and isocitrate dehydrogenase activities; liver ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), glutathione S-transferases, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities and lipid peroxidation levels (LPO). A significant decrease of the swimming velocity (LOEC<c2><a0>=<c2><a0>2<c2><a0>mg<c2><a0>l^sup -1^), an inhibition of both AChE (LOEC<c2><a0>=<c2><a0>0.06<c2><a0>mg<c2><a0>l^sup -1^) and ChE activities (LOEC<c2><a0>=<c2><a0>0.03<c2><a0>mg<c2><a0>l^sup -1^), and a positive and significant correlation between the swimming velocity and AChE were found in exposed fish, suggesting an influence of the inhibition of these enzymes in the swimming velocity decrease. An increase of EROD activity (LOEC<c2><a0>=<c2><a0>1<c2><a0>mg<c2><a0>l^sup -1^), indicating the involvement of this enzyme in fenitrothion biotransformation, and a negative and significant correlation between EROD activity and swimming velocity were also found, suggesting that the two findings may somehow be related. Furthermore, results show a significant induction of SOD (LOEC<c2><a0>=<c2><a0>0.13<c2><a0>mg<c2><a0>l^sup -1^) without LPO increase, suggesting that the enzyme is preventing oxidative stress damage. No significant alterations were found in any of the other parameters tested. Thus, exposure of seabass to fenitrothion in the wild at concentrations similar to those tested here may have adverse consequences at population level as neurotransmission and swimming ability are essential for fish performance and survival.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Common cockles (Cerastoderma edule, L. 1758, Bivalvia: Cardiidae) were subjected to a laboratory assay with sediments collected from distinct sites of the Sado Estuary (Portugal). Cockles were obtained from a mariculture site of the Sado Estuary and exposed through 28-day, semi-static, assays to sediments collected from three sites of the estuary. Sediments from these sites revealed different physico-chemical properties and levels of metals and organic contaminants, ranging from unimpacted (the reference site) to moderately impacted, when compared to available sediment quality guidelines. Cockles were surveyed for bioaccumulation of trace elements (Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Cd and Pb) and organic contaminants (PAHs, PCBs and DDTs). Two sets of potential biomarkers were employed to assess toxicity: whole-body metallothionein (MT) induction and digestive gland histopathology. The bioaccumulation factor and the biota-to-soil accumulation factor were estimated as ecological indices of exposure to metals and organic compounds. From the results it is inferred that C. edule responds to sediment-bound contamination and might, therefore, be suitable for biomonitoring. The species was found capable to regulate and eliminate both types of contaminants. Still, the sediment contamination levels do not account for all the variation in bioaccumulation and MT levels, which may result from the moderate metal concentrations found in sediments, the species' intrinsic resistance to pollution and from yet unexplained xenobiotic interaction effects.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Mercury was undetectable, but selenium, rarely reported in otoliths and known as a physiological antagonist to mercury, was. Strontium was also present but appeared to be taken up independently of selenium, and thus these serve as independent biogeochemical markers. Both selenium and mercury were detected in fish tissues, but selenium was below levels considered toxic. Selenium was low in otoliths of fishes collected in nearby Oneida Lake. Synoptic surveys of water chemistry revealed that Se is regionally highest in Onondaga Lake and in particular its main inlet, Onondaga Creek. SXFM appears to be a sensitive method for detecting selenium in otoliths. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Repeatability of physiological traits in juvenile Pacific abalone, Haliotis discus hannai},
abstract={Several studies on individual physiological traits assume that past records may predict future performance. Marine mollusks, as other animals, show a wide range of between- and within-individual variation of physiological traits. However, in this group, almost nothing is known about the relative influence of genetic factors on that variation. Repeatability (R) is a measure of the consistency of the variation of a trait, which includes its genetic variance and represents the maximum potential value of its heritability (h^sup 2^). Traits that show high inter-individual variation and high repeatability levels could potentially evolve through selection (natural or artificial). We estimated the repeatability [using intra-class (<cf><84>) and Pearson-moment (r) correlation coefficients] of several physiological traits related to energy acquisition and allocation in juvenile Pacific abalone Haliotis discus hannai, maintained under controlled environment growing systems. In order to estimate the range of the R values and the effect of the time elapsed between measurements on these estimates, we measured these traits monthly during 6 months for each individual. Among the physiological traits, those related to energy allocation like oxygen consumption (standard metabolic rate, SMR) and ammonium excretion rates, and oxygen/nitrogen ratio (O/N), showed intermediate levels of repeatability (0.48, 0.55 and 0.39, respectively), when this was estimated by <cf><84> coefficient. However, the r estimation showed that SMR and O/N repeatability were significant and high (0.6-0.7 and 0.5-0.7, respectively) during the first 5 consecutive measurements, decreasing strongly (0.3 and 0.2, respectively) during the last measurement. For ammonia excretion, although repeatability (r) decreased from 0.8 to 0.5 during the 6 consecutive measurements, they remain significant during the experimental period. Therefore, our results indicate that for H. discus hannai juveniles, physiological traits like SMR, ammonia excretion and O/N are significantly repeatable (i.e. good predictors of future measurements) during a period of 4-5 months. These significant repeatability values suggest an important genetic control upon the phenotypic variation of these physiological traits, and could potentially respond to natural or artificial selection, and be used in genetic improvement programs. By contrast, those traits related to energy acquisition (i.e. ingestion, absorption and assimilation) and physiological efficiencies (i.e. net growth and scope for growth) showed very low levels of repeatability (0-0.07). This indicates that the phenotypic variation of these traits would be more influenced by environment rather than by genetic factors. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Toxic effects of molluscicidal baits to the terrestrial isopod Porcellionides pruinosus (Brandt, 1833)},
abstract={Methiocarb and metaldehyde are the most common molluscicides applied in agricultural and horticultural fields in Portugal and elsewhere in Europe. The application of molluscicidal baits to control slug and snail populations can pose a threat to non-target organisms like terrestrial isopods, because they are detritivorous and may feed on the toxic baits applied to the soil surface. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effects and understand the modes of action of these molluscicides to terrestrial isopods. In this study, the terrestrial isopod Porcellionides pruinosus was exposed to these two molluscicides, and the time to lethality was evaluated. Biochemical indicators (biomarkers) are known to provide early warning signs of environmental pollution or stress conditions to the organisms, by measuring cellular or molecular responses of the target organism to xenobiotic agents. Therefore, to evaluate modes of action and effects and also to see if biomarkers can be used as early warning tools in molluscicidal exposures, three different enzymes, glutathione S-transferase (GST), acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and catalase (CAT), were analysed upon single exposures and binary mixtures tests. These two molluscicides showed to be of extreme concern regarding terrestrial isopods, as all animals died after 24<c2><a0>h of exposure to methiocarb, and only 20% survived after 56<c2><a0>h of exposure to metaldehyde. Results indicate that the carbamate methiocarb inhibited significantly AChE activity, but no effects were observed in CAT and GST levels. The exposure to metaldehyde had no effects on AChE, but a decrease in GST activity as well as a general increase in CAT activity was observed at the higher exposure period tested (32<c2><a0>h). The combined exposure of the two molluscicides resulted in a general decrease in AChE and CAT activity, but no visible effects were observed in terms of GST activity. The LT50 values found in the single exposures to both molluscicides were very low, especially in the case of the carbamate methiocarb. The use of several biomarkers was a suitable tool to understand the mode of action of these two molluscicides in this isopod species. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Predicting bioavailability and bioaccumulation of arsenic by freshwater clam Corbicula fluminea using valve daily activity},
abstract={There are many bioindicators. However, it remains largely unknown which metal-bioindicator systems will give the reasonable detection ranges of bioavailable metals in the aquatic ecosystem. Various experimental data make the demonstration of biomonitoring processes challenging. Ingested inorganic arsenic is strongly associated with a wide spectrum of adverse health outcomes. Freshwater clam Corbicula fluminea, one of the most commonly used freshwater biomomitoring organisms, presents daily activity in valve movement and demonstrates biotic uptake potential to accumulate arsenic. Here, a systematical way was provided to dynamically link valve daily activity in C. fluminea and arsenic bioavailability and toxicokinetics to predict affinity at arsenic-binding site in gills and arsenic body burden. Using computational ecotoxicology methods, a valve daily rhythm<c2><a0>model can be tuned mathematically to the responsive ranges of valve daily activity system in response to varied bioavailable arsenic concentration. The patterned response then can be used to predict the site-specific bioavailable arsenic concentration at the specific measuring time window. This approach can yield predictive data of results from toxicity studies of specific bioindicators that can assist in prediction of risk for aquatic animals and humans. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Butyltin contamination in sediments and seawater from Kaohsiung Harbor, Taiwan},
abstract={The distribution of butyltin (BT) compounds in the sediments and seawater, at the river outfalls, fishing ports, shipyards, and industrial zone docks of Kaohsiung Harbor, Taiwan were investigated. Twenty sediment and seawater samples were collected from various locations in the Harbor in 2006 and analyzed for monobutyltin (MBT), dibutyltin (DBT), and tributyltin (TBT). Results showed that the concentration of total BTs varied from 1.5 to 151<c2><a0>ng/g in sediment samples, with TBT being the major component of the sediment samples. This suggests that sediments could be the most possible sink of TBT brought by the sorption mechanism. The concentrations of BTs ranged from 9.7 to 270<c2><a0>ng/L in seawater samples, whereas DBT and MBT, the degradation byproducts of TBT, were mainly the most abundant BT compounds of the seawater samples. This indicates that the abiotic or biotic degradation potential of TBT was significant. Spatially, the highest concentrations of BTs were observed in both water and sediment samples collected from the shipyard and fishing port areas. This indicates that the shipping-related activities (e.g., navigation, ship repair, and ship building) would contribute most of BTs in the environment. Results show that the concentrations of degradation products (DBT and MBT) were related closely to temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen (DO), and chlorophyll-a of the seawater. This implies that seasonal changes of the water parameters controlled the degradation of TBT in seawater. The observed levels of BT compounds in both seawater and sediments were much higher than those required to induce toxic effects on marine organisms, suggesting that appropriate TBT control strategies should be taken in Kaohsiung Harbor.

abstract={The aim of this research was to assess the combined effects of three heavy metals (copper, lead, cadmium) on the fertilization and offspring quality of the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus at EC50, NOEL, and EC1 concentrations. The observed data were compared with the predictions derived from approaches of Concentration Addition (CA) and Independent Action (IA) in order to evaluate the proper prediction of the observed mixture toxic effect. The P. lividus embryotoxicity of trace metals decreases as follows: Cu > Pb > Cd at all toxicity concentration tested. EC50 mixture revealed less toxic only than Cu; EC50 was 0.80 (<c2><b1>0.07) mg/l, the offspring malformations were mainly P1 type (skeletal alterations) up to 20% mixture concentration, and P2 type from 70% concentration. The NOEL and EC1 mixtures evidenced that all compounds contribute to the overall toxicity, even if present at low concentrations: the former EC50 was 0.532 (<c2><b1>0.058) mg/l and the latter was 1.081 (<c2><b1>0.240) mg/l. The developmental defects observed were mainly P1 type in both mixtures. Both CA and IA models did not accurately predict mixture toxicity for EC50 and NOEL mixtures. Instead, EC1 mixture effects seemed well represented by the IA model. The protective action of the CA model, although quite accurate when applied to simple biological systems like algae and bacteria, but failed to represent the worst-case in this study with more complex organisms. It would be useful to introduce in the models one or more factors that take into account the complexity of these biological systems.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={We quantified sublethal and sex-specific cypermethrin effects in experiments (29 days) with the midge Chironomus riparius at different levels of sediment organic matter content (0, 5, and 20%). We found highly significant effects of cypermethrin concentrations and sediment type on emergence, mean development rate, and adult size. For example, emergence/survival rates were 70-100% below 0.8 [mu]g/l and unaffected by organic matter content. At 3.2 [mu]g/l, however, no larvae survived in sediment without organic matter, but survival successively increased to 26 <c2><b1> 11% in sediment with 20% organic matter. Mean development rates were always higher for males than for females, and significant differences between sexes occurred consistently in controls and in treatments with our lowest concentration of 0.05 [mu]g/l. Sex-specific differences in mean development rate decreased across the cypermethrin gradient, suggesting that male development was affected more than that of females at similar concentrations. We also found an increase in adult size across the concentration gradient in sediments lacking organic matter and suggest an increased feeding activity due to sublethal toxic stress as a probable causal mechanism. We speculate that the observed sex-specific effects on development rates and adult size can have strong repercussions on emergence timing and fecundity, respectively.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Fish reproduction is subjected to worrying trends in many aquatic environments. In this study, we report the absence of histological and biochemical alterations in fish sampled in a low contaminated site (characterised by the absence of detectable oestrogenic activity and mutagenicity in sediment extracts). A total of 474 roach (Rutilus rutilus) were monthly sampled during 18<c2><a0>months, and no intersex fish were recorded after careful histological examination, thus indicating that the incidence of this phenomenon may be very low under natural conditions. Furthermore, mean male plasma vitellogenin concentration was 24<c2><a0>ng<c2><a0>ml^sup -1^ and was only slightly elevated during the spawning period (up to 120<c2><a0>ng<c2><a0>ml^sup -1^) indicating that these low values may be characteristic of a low contaminated site. Of the male roach, 45.3% were sampled, a sex-ratio that did not significantly deviated from the expected 1:1 ratio between male and female. Results also showed that natural conditions can greatly affect the reproductive cycle of roach. Gametogenesis showed a biphasic pattern with first gonad maturation between September and December and a final maturation occurring at the end of winter/early spring. Under decreasing temperatures, particularly below 6<c2><b0>C, gametogenesis was stopped or even regressed with secondary oocytes becoming rare under histological observation. Conversely, elevated temperatures during the winter lead to an earlier gonad maturation.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={The quality of the ballast water exchange scheme affects many aspects of a ship, including intact stability, structural strength, building and operational expenses, etc. This paper focuses on developing an optimization methodology for large-scale sequential ballast water exchange. The method of transversely symmetrical ballast water tanks being exchanged simultaneously is adopted, and the potentials of multiple tanks being exchanged at a time are explored. The mathematical model for the symmetrical ballast water exchange problem is built by minimizing the occurred maximum trims, maximum hull girder bending moments, and shearing forces as objectives, and the related safety assessment criteria as constraints. A multiobjective genetic algorithm with some operators specially designed for the problem is presented to obtain a set of approximate Pareto-optimal solutions for engineers to choose from. Finally, a real case study on the symmetrical ballast water exchange of a 176,000<c2><a0>DWT bulk carrier is conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={We proposed that Rangia cuneata (Sowerby, 1831) is an important estuarine bivalve with ecological significance in three coastal lakes in Barataria Bay, Gulf of Mexico--Lake Cataouatche, Lake Salvador and Lac des Allemands. Our goals were to determine the abundance and distribution of Rangia in these lakes and to measure clearance times to elucidate its potential impacts on phytoplankton communities. The estimated average densities of R.<c2><a0>cuneata in Lake Cataouatche, Lake Salvador, and Lac des Allemands were 63, 157, and 107 individuals<c2><a0>m^sup -2^, respectively, which is 30% lower than that observed in nearby Lake Pontchartrain. The size of clams in Lake Salvador was between 4 and 50<c2><a0>mm, while individuals in Lake Cataouatche and Lac des Allemands were mostly >20<c2><a0>mm. We postulate that a relatively infrequent large tropical storm transported the larvae from Lake Salvador to the other two lakes 1<c2><a0>year before our sampling to create this size difference. The clams were up to 99.9% of the total benthic biomass in Lake Salvador, 15.9% in Lake Cataouatche, and 40.0% in Lac des Allemands. The R.<c2><a0>cuneata biomass values were between 16.2 and 27.6<c2><a0>g<c2><a0>m^sup -2^ and the clearance times were 1.0-1.5<c2><a0>days. The clearance times are among the highest previously reported for coastal bivalve communities, which were from cooler climates. The results demonstrate that Rangia can be a critical part of the ecological processes in shallow water systems of the Gulf of Mexico. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

The relationships between the C and N stable isotope compositions of the exoskeletons and those of the whole body were investigated for two freshwater cladoceran taxa (Bosmina sp. and Daphnia sp.) from modern samples. The C and N stable isotope compositions of the exoskeleton and those of the whole body were strongly correlated. Exoskeleton [delta]^sup 13^C was similar to the whole body [delta]^sup 13^C for both taxa. Daphnia exoskeletons were strongly depleted in ^sup 15^N (-7.9[per thousand]) compared to the whole body. Stable isotope analyses were thereafter performed on cladoceran remains from five downcore samples from Lake Annecy, France. Results showed that Bosmina [delta]^sup 15^N values increased by more than 4[per thousand], between the early twentieth and twenty first centuries. Such changes might be the result of changes in nitrogen sources or cycling in the lake and/or of major shifts in Bosmina trophic position within the lake food web. This study sets up the potential of stable isotope analyses performed on cladoceran subfossil remains for paleo-ecological purposes. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Marine Glycobiology: Current Status and Future Perspectives},
abstract={Glycobiology, which is the study of the structure and function of carbohydrates and carbohydrate containing molecules, is fundamental to all biological systems. Progress in glycobiology has shed light on a range of complex biological processes associated with, for example, disease and immunology, molecular and cellular communication, and developmental biology. There is an established, if rather modest, tradition of glycobiology research in marine systems that has primarily focused on reproduction, biofouling, and chemical communication. The current status of marine glycobiology research is primarily descriptive with very limited progress on structural elucidation and the subsequent definition of precise functional roles beyond a small number of classical examples, e.g., induction of the acrosome reaction in echinoderms. However, with recent advances in analytical instrumentation, there is now the capacity to begin to characterize marine glycoconjugates, many of which will have potential biomedical and biotechnological applications. The analytical approach to glycoscience has developed to such an extent that it has acquired its own "-omics" identity. Glycomics is the quest to decipher the complex information conveyed by carbohydrate molecules--the carbohydrate code or glycocode. Due to the paucity of structural information available, this article will highlight the fundamental importance of glycobiology for many biological processes in marine organisms and will draw upon the best defined systems. These systems therefore may prove genuine candidates for full carbohydrate characterization.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Plankton dynamics along a 180 km reach of the Saint Lawrence River from its headwaters in Lake Ontario},
abstract={We test the hypothesis that phytoplankton biomass decrease upon entry into the St. Lawrence River from headwaters in Lake Ontario is attributable to a range of causal factors including, decreased photosynthetic fitness due to turbulence, cell loss due to increased flocculation and subsequent sedimentation, decreases in nutrients, and loss due to grazing. In order to test this, changes in phytoplankton and crustacean zooplankton concentrations were examined during four transects along the river, from 8<c2><a0>km offshore in Lake Ontario to the hydroelectric power dam 180<c2><a0>km downstream. Both phytoplankton biomass, measured as chlorophyll-a, and zooplankton decreased markedly upon entry of lake water into the river. Phytoplankton community composition and size changed little over the river reach and tended to reflect that in Lake Ontario. Total phosphorus increased with transit of river water downstream despite low tributary inputs of water into this reach of river. Light availability was high, photosynthetic efficiency suggested that phytoplankton were not physiologically stressed during transit in turbulent waters, and there was no direct evidence of flocculation causing sedimentation of phytoplankton. Grazing by the benthic community (filtering insect larvae and dreissenid mussels) is inferred to be a dominant biological factor as is the geomorphology in this reach of the river, which includes large littoral areas, shoals, and reaches of high water velocity that can increase particle contact in the water column with benthic grazers. The findings of this study have a bearing on understanding how changing water levels in a regulated river might alter areas of benthic grazing. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Survival, growth and immune response of the scallop, Chlamys farreri, cultured in lantern nets at five different depths (2, 5, 10, 15, and 20 m below the sea surface) were studied in Haizhou Bay during the hot season (summer and autumn) of 2007. Survival and growth rates were quantified bimonthly. Immune activities in hemolymph (superoxide dismutase (SOD) and acid phosphatase (ACP)) were measured to evaluate the health of scallops at the end of the study. Environmental parameters at the five depths were also monitored during the experiment. Mortalities mainly occurred during summer. Survival of scallops suspended at 15 m (78.0%) and 20 m (86.7%) was significantly higher than at 2 m (62.9%), 5 m (60.8%) or 10 m (66.8%) at the end of the study. Mean shell height grew significantly faster at 10 m (205.0 mcm/d) and 20 m (236.9 mcm/d) than at 2, 5 or 15 m in summer (July 9 to September 1); however, shell growth rate at 20 m was significantly lower than at the other four depths in autumn (September 2 to November 6). In contrast to summer, scallops at 5 m grew faster (262.9 mcm/d) during autumn. The growth of soft tissue at different depths showed a similar trend to the shell. Growth rates of shell height and soft tissue were faster in autumn than in summer, with the exception of shell height at 20 m. SOD activity of scallops increased with depth, and ACP activity was significantly higher at 15 and 20 m than at other depths, which suggests that scallops were healthier near the bottom. Factors explaining the depth-related mortality and growth of scallops are also discussed. We conclude that the mass mortality of scallop, C. farreri, during summer can be prevented by moving the culture area to deeper water and yield can be maximized by suspending the scallops in deep water during summer and then transferring them to shallow water in autumn.

abstract={Global environmental change poses emerging environmental health challenges throughout the world. One of such threats could be found in chemical safety in aquatic ecosystem. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of several environmental factors, such as water pH, temperature and ultraviolet light on the toxicity of pharmaceutical compounds in water, using freshwater invertebrate Daphnia magna. Seven pharmaceuticals including ibuprofen, acetaminophen, lincomycin, ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, chlortetracycline and sulfathiazole were chosen as test compounds based on their frequent detection in water. The experimental conditions of environmental parameters were selected within the ranges that could be encountered in temperate environment, i.e., water temperature (15, 21, and 25<c2><b0>C), pH (7.4, 8.3, and 9.2), and UV-B light intensity (continuous irradiation of 15.0<c2><a0><ce><bc>W/cm^sup 2^). For acetaminophen, enrofloxacin and sulfathiazole, decrease in water pH generally led to increase of acute lethal toxicity, which could be explained by the unionized fraction of pharmaceuticals. Increase of water temperature enhanced the acute toxicity of the acetaminophen, enrofloxacin and chlortetracycline, potentially due to alteration in toxicokinetics of chemicals as well as impact on physiological mechanisms of the test organism. The presence of UV-B light significantly increased the toxicity of sulfathiazole, which could be explained by photo-modification of this chemical that lead to oxidative stress. Under the UV light, however, acute toxicity of enrofloxacin decreased, which might be due to photo-degradation. Since changing environmental conditions could affect exposure and concentration-response profile of environmental contaminants, such conditions should be identified and evaluated in order to better manage ecosystem health under changing global environment.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

In this review we describe: (i) the involvement of such structures in both cellular and in vitro processes; (ii) the toxins that target the cytoskeletal elements and dynamics; (iii) the main steps of reproduction and the marine drugs that interfere with these cytoskeleton-mediated processes.

title={SOD and CAT cDNA cloning, and expression pattern of detoxification genes in the freshwater bivalve Unio tumidus transplanted into the Moselle river},
abstract={The cDNA sequences encoding manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) and catalase (CAT) were isolated in the freshwater bivalve Unio tumidus by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using degenerate primers. Quantitative real-time PCR approach was used to evaluate the mRNA expression patterns of SOD, CAT, selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase (Se-GPx), pi class glutathione S-transferase (pi-GST) and metallothionein (MT), in the digestive gland of Unio tumidus transplanted from a control site to four stations in the Moselle River (M1-M4), for periods of 8 and 21<c2><a0>days. These sites were chosen upstream and downstream of populated areas. Chemical analysis performed on sediments from the Moselle river sites did not show high levels of pollutants. Decrease of SOD, CAT, Se-GPx and MT mRNA levels were observed at M3 site after a 21-day exposure compared to control site. These results suggest inefficiency of antioxidant systems affected by cytotoxic mechanisms and confirm an environmental perturbation. Organisms transplanted at M4 site showed a strong increase of biomarkers transcription levels after 21<c2><a0>days of exposure. These inductions could correspond to an adaptive response to an altered environment. Our results showed that biological approaches using multibiomarkers appear as essential tools complementary to measurement of contaminants, to detect environmental degradations.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Contaminants in the Upper Mississippi River: historic trends, responses to regulatory controls, and emerging concerns},
abstract={Issue Title: Upper Mississippi River Research Synthesis: Forty Years of Ecological Research / Guest Editors: S.P. Romano & B. Ickes We synthesized information on selected contaminants in the Upper Mississippi River, summarized regulatory measures enacted to reduce pollution, and described biotic and ecosystem responses to regulatory actions. Contamination of the river with mercury and lead rapidly followed settlement of the basin by European immigrants in the mid-1800s. Metal contamination peaked in the 1960s and has since decreased substantially. DDT, its degradation product DDE, and PCBs biomagnified to concentrations that adversely affected wildlife in upper trophic levels. National (U.S.A.) environmental regulations enacted from 1972 to 1991 reduced discharges of wastes from point sources, improved wastewater treatment, and reduced or banned the production or usage of certain chemicals, such as DDT, PCBs, and lead. Responses to these regulatory measures include reductions in ecosystem contamination, reductions in biotic exposure, and recovery of affected wildlife populations. Recovery from pollution has been slow, however, and we conclude that proactive approaches focusing on prevention are highly preferable to reactive approaches in management of toxic substances. Past successes in reducing point-source pollution, which is greatest near urban areas, do not extend to nonpoint-source pollution, given that the existing regulatory framework does not adequately address nonpoint sources. The river continues to receive hundreds of recently synthesized chemicals, and the behavior and effects of most of these compounds in aquatic ecosystems are largely unknown. Emerging contaminants and recently discovered mechanisms of adverse biological effects, such as endocrine disruption, pose continuing challenges to scientists and environmental managers concerned with the ecological health of this riverine ecosystem.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Zooplankton communities were studied in a river and its tributaries with different hydrological, biological and physico-chemical conditions. Small similarities were noted in the zooplankton community (mostly Rotifera) between a tributary characterised by a regular bed and the river. No influence of a tributary with an irregular bed and variable water flow was noted on the zooplankton of the river it joined. It was concluded that the tributaries had very little influence on the zooplankton community in the river which they joined. The most probable reasons for this were the predatory behaviour of fry, escape of zooplankton into the river vegetation and therefore not carried down by the river current, and reproduction of zooplankton in slack waters, small floodplains and densely vegetated riparian zones of the main river.

title={Sublethal toxicant effects with dynamic energy budget theory: model formulation},
abstract={We develop and test a general modeling framework to describe the sublethal effects of pollutants by adding toxicity modules to an established dynamic energy budget (DEB) model. The DEB model describes the rates of energy acquisition and expenditure by individual organisms; the toxicity modules describe how toxicants affect these rates by changing the value of one or more DEB parameters, notably the parameters quantifying the rates of feeding and maintenance. We investigate four toxicity modules that assume: (1) effects on feeding only; (2) effects on maintenance only; (3) effects on feeding and maintenance with similar values for the toxicity parameters; and (4) effects on feeding and maintenance with different values for the toxicity parameters. We test the toxicity modules by fitting each to published data on feeding, respiration, growth and reproduction. Among the pollutants tested are metals (mercury and copper) and various organic compounds (chlorophenols, toluene, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, tetradifon and pyridine); organisms include mussels, oysters, earthworms, water fleas and zebrafish. In most cases, the data sets could be adequately described with any of the toxicity modules, and no single module gave superior fits to all data sets. We therefore propose that for many applications, it is reasonable to use the most general and parameter sparse module, i.e. module 3 that assumes similar effects on feeding and maintenance, as a default. For one example (water fleas), we use parameter estimates to calculate the impact of food availability and toxicant levels on the long term population growth rate.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Genotoxicity monitoring of freshwater environments using caged carp (Cyprinus carpio)},
abstract={The present study deals with genotoxicity assessment of freshwaters using caged carp (Cyprinus carpio). Carps were transplanted from a fish-farm to three differently polluted sites in eastern Croatia. Two polluted sites were situated in the river Drava, downstream from the cities of Belisce and Osijek, while the reference site was in the Nature Park Kopacki rit, a preserved wetland area with limited anthropogenic influence. Exposure lasted for 3<c2><a0>weeks and was repeated for 3<c2><a0>years (2002-2004). DNA damage was assessed in erythrocytes of the exposed animals by the Comet assay and micronucleus test (MNT). In order to evaluate possible differences in stress responses to polluted water in situ and in aquaria a laboratory exposure was performed with water from the studied location in the second year of the study. Carp from the sites with high anthropogenic influence (Belisce and Osijek) had higher average DNA damage as expressed in both the MNT and Comet assay. Of the two, the Comet assay appeared to be more sensitive following both caging and aquaria exposures. The results from this study suggest that 3<c2><a0>weeks caging exposure of C. carpio may be a useful strategy to monitor for genotoxic agents in freshwater ecosystems.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Variations in retention efficiency of bivalves to different concentrations and organic content of suspended particles},
abstract={Retention efficiencies (RE) of scallop (Chlamys farreri), oyster (Crassostrea gigas) and mussel (Mytilus edulis) in a flow-through system were measured to understand the short-term response to various particle and organic matter concentrations. By comparing the RE of C. farreri with that of C. gigas and M. edulis, we gained further knowledge on the feeding physiological characteristics of C. farreri and ascertained the possible cause of high summer mortalities of this species. The experimental feeding conditions included natural differences in the abundance and composition of suspended seston, as well as conditions in which seston abundance and composition were manipulated by adding natural silt or cultured microalgae. The results show that in natural sea water, the minimum particle size for maximal retention in M. edulis, C. gigas and C. farreri was approximately 4, 6, and 8 <ce><bc>m, respectively; the RE of 2-<ce><bc>m (equivalent spherical diameter) particles was 17%, 19%, and 8%, respectively; and the relative standardized RE was 58%, 49%, and 18%, respectively. In C. gigas and M. edulis, the minimal particle size for maximal retention did not change with food quality (organic content). C. farreri was more sensitive to fluctuations in particle concentration and organic content. With particle concentration increase, the minimal particle size for maximal retention in scallop shifted to large particles and the RE for 2-<ce><bc>m particle decreased from 8% in natural seawater to 1.6%-6% in silt-enriched groups. With organic content increase, the minimal particle size for maximal retention shifted from 8 to 5 <ce><bc>m in natural seawater.Variation in RE of C. farreri with food conditions and the relationship between lower RE and smaller particle size may hamper C. farreri from food taking due to the decrease in the size distribution of phytoplankton in Sungo Bay.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Vertebrate diets derived from trophically transmitted fish parasites in the Bothnian Bay},
abstract={Parasites that are transmitted through predator-prey interactions may be used as indicators of trophic relationships between organisms. Yet, they are rarely used as such in the construction of topological (predator-prey) food webs. We constructed food webs of vertebrate trophic interactions using observed diet alone, trophically transmitted parasites alone, and the combination of the two based on data from 31 species of fish from the Bothnian Bay, Finland. The fish food web contained 530 links derived from observed diet, 724 links inferred from parasitism, and 1,058 links calculated from a combination of both stomach contents and parasites. This sub-web constructed from stomach contents had a mean of 17.1 links per fish species, while that using parasites had 23.4 links per fish. Combining the two diet indicators yielded 34.1 links per fish species, illustrating the complementarity of the two methods. Mean number of prey species per fish species was 12.5 using observed diet items, 15.8 using parasites, and 24.5 using both measures together. Mean number of predators per fish species was 7.4 using observed diet, 11.7 using parasites and 15.0 using both. A positive correlation was found between the mean number of parasites and the number of prey taxa in the diet among the fishes. Omnivorous fish had the highest diversity of both parasite species and prey items, while benthophagous fish had among the lowest. Mean total abundance and mean total prevalence of parasites correlated positively with fish size, with piscivores being the largest with the highest abundance and prevalence, while planktivores and benthivores had the lowest. Trophically transmitted parasites may be used to help construct vertebrate sub-webs and derive information about food web processes. Parasites alone provided equivalent if not more information than observed diet. However, resolution is improved by using parasites and observed diet together.},

title={Comparative study of the fate and mobility of metals discharged in mining and urban effluents using sequential extractions on suspended solids},
abstract={The fate, bioavailability and environmental impacts of metals discharged in municipal and mining wastewater discharge will depend to a large extent on chemical speciation and distribution. Previous studies on metal bioaccumulation have shown that total metal concentrations are not a good predictor of bioavailability in the dispersion plumes of municipal effluents. The objective of this study was to determine the solid phase speciation of metals in surface waters receiving urban and mining effluents in order to assess their fate and relative mobility in the receiving environment. Suspended particulate matter was sampled using sediment traps at several sites downstream of effluent outfall plumes as well as at reference upstream sites. Particulate metal in operationally defined fractions--exchangeable/carbonates, reducible, oxidisable and residual--were determined in suspended particulate matter with a series of selective chemical extractions. Metal enrichment in suspended particles was generally observed in both mining and urban effluent discharges. When compared to its receiving environment, the mining effluent appeared to release more particulate metals (Cu, Fe, Zn) in the most reactive fractions (i.e. exchangeable/carbonates + reducible forms, 23-43%), while other released metals, such as Cd and Mn, were predominantly in the least reactive forms (i.e., oxidisable + residual, 73-97%). In contrast, the reactivity of all particulate metals, with the exception of Mn, from the urban effluent was much higher, with up to 65, 42, 30 and 43% for Cd, Cu, Fe and Zn, respectively, in the two most reactive fractions. As expected in effluent dispersion plumes, parameters such as the organic carbon, Fe oxide and carbonate contents have specific effects on the partitioning of several trace metals, particularly Cd, Cu and Zn. Our results indicated that the relative distributions of metals among geochemical fractions varied in the effluent receiving waters where organic carbon and Fe oxides appeared as the most important parameters. This could therefore decrease the exposure for aquatic organisms that are exposed to those contaminated sediments as well as the risk to human health. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Differential expression of heat shock protein 70 in relation to stress type in the flatworm Schmidtea polychroa},
abstract={Most heat shock proteins help to cope with stress in organisms ranging from bacteria to vertebrates. Many stress types acting on the intensity of intracellular protein can induce expression of heat shock proteins. Here, we studied changes in expression level of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), one of the best investigated stress proteins, in response to five potential stress factors in the planarian flatworm Schmidtea polychroa: (1) homogenized planarian tissue, which releases an alarm substance that signals predation injury, (2) physical damage by puncturing, (3) a simulation of ecological competition by adding a mixture of naturally co-occurring species: one Dendrocoelum and two Polycelis flatworms, one Asellus water louse and one leech, and (4) magnesium chloride, which inhibits regeneration ability. We found that alarm substance (1), physical harm (2), and magnesium chloride (4) led to increased expression of Hsp70, while interspecific competition (3) did not result in elevated Hsp70 expression. There was no difference between the experimental negative control and two temporal controls immediately after collection and just before the experiment. Results show that Schmidtea polychroa is not sensitive to sampling and lab maintenance. However, planarian homogenate, magnesium chloride and physical harm all caused Hsp70-inducing stress. We conclude that Hsp70 quantification is appropriate to study the current stress level in planaria in response to specific conditions. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Standardizing acute toxicity data for use in ecotoxicology models: influence of test type, life stage, and concentration reporting},
abstract={Ecotoxicological models generally have large data requirements and are frequently based on existing information from diverse sources. Standardizing data for toxicological models may be necessary to reduce extraneous variation and to ensure models reflect intrinsic relationships. However, the extent to which data standardization is necessary remains unclear, particularly when data transformations are used in model development. An extensive acute toxicity database was compiled for aquatic species to comprehensively assess the variation associated with acute toxicity test type (e.g., flow-through, static), reporting concentrations as nominal or measured, and organism life stage. Three approaches were used to assess the influence of these factors on log-transformed acute toxicity: toxicity ratios, log-linear models of factor groups, and comparison of interspecies correlation estimation (ICE) models developed using either standardized test types or reported concentration type. In general, median ratios were generally less than 2.0, the slopes of log-linear models were approximately one for well-represented comparisons, and ICE models developed using data from standardized test types or reported concentrations did not differ substantially. These results indicate that standardizing test data by acute test type, reported concentration type, or life stage may not be critical for developing ecotoxicological models using large datasets of log-transformed values.},

abstract={Little is known about the toxicity of the atrazine (ATRZ) metabolites desethylatrazine (DEA) and deisopropylatrazine (DIA). We evaluated the acute and chronic toxicity of ATRZ, DEA, and DIA on the amphipods Hyalella azteca and Diporeia spp., and the unicellular algae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata. In general, acute and chronic toxicity was ranked ATRZ<c2><a0>><c2><a0>DEA<c2><a0>><c2><a0>DIA. All 96-h median inhibition concentrations (IC50) were above concentrations found in the environment (>1,500<c2><a0><ce><bc>g/L), and sensitivity was highest for the algae. When amphipods were exposed chronically (21<c2><a0>days), Diporeia was several orders of magnitude more sensitive compared to H. azteca. Neither ATRZ nor DEA altered H. azteca sex ratios. In conclusion, our results suggest that short-term exposures of these chemicals to algae and amphipods to concentrations routinely detected in surface waters are unlikely to be a cause of concern. However, the unexpected high sensitivity of Diporeia spp. to these herbicides deserves further attention considering the declining status of this amphipod in the Great Lakes basin.},

title={Use of Measurement Data in Evaluating Exposure of Humans and Wildlife to POPs/PBTs},
abstract={The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) recognized that POPs resist degradation, undergo long-range transport, and accumulate in remote ecosystems. The Stockholm Convention also acknowledged that indigenous communities, particularly in the Arctic, were at risk because of the biomagnification of POPs and contamination of their traditional foods. This recognition was largely based on environmental monitoring data and demonstrates the need to have adequate guidance on data collection and use. Although long-range transport, persistence, and bioaccumulation models are important for screening potential POPs and for assessing human exposure, environmental measurement data are needed to confirm predictions, indeed the Stockholm Convention (Annex E) requires monitoring data for assessing "exposure in local areas and, in particular, as a result of long-range environmental transport." However, there is relatively little guidance available on the most appropriate environmental measurement approaches, particularly for new candidate POPs, and on how to create a weight of evidence based on such data. We provide guidance on how to assess existing data that have been generated by monitoring programs and individual studies on the exposure of top predators and humans to candidate or potential POPs, as well as considerations for collecting new additional data. Our overall recommendation for assessing exposure in humans and top predators is to use or obtain direct measurements of the compound of concern from a significantly and uniquely exposed population (indigenous populations, remote populations), as well as data demonstrating biomagnification within food webs and time trends if possible. These data must be from the appropriate sample matrix type, collected and analyzed using accepted methodologies, reviewed for quality assurance, and interpreted correctly in order to be used to assess exposure.

title={Modeling Exposure to Persistent Chemicals in Hazard and Risk Assessment},
abstract={Fate and exposure modeling has not, thus far, been explicitly used in the risk profile documents prepared for evaluating the significant adverse effect of candidate chemicals for either the Stockholm Convention or the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution. However, we believe models have considerable potential to improve the risk profiles. Fate and exposure models are already used routinely in other similar regulatory applications to inform decisions, and they have been instrumental in building our current understanding of the fate of persistent organic pollutants (POP) and persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic (PBT) chemicals in the environment. The goal of this publication is to motivate the use of fate and exposure models in preparing risk profiles in the POP assessment procedure by providing strategies for incorporating and using models. The ways that fate and exposure models can be used to improve and inform the development of risk profiles include 1) benchmarking the ratio of exposure and emissions of candidate chemicals to the same ratio for known POPs, thereby opening the possibility of combining this ratio with the relative emissions and relative toxicity to arrive at a measure of relative risk; 2) directly estimating the exposure of the environment, biota, and humans to provide information to complement measurements or where measurements are not available or are limited; 3) to identify the key processes and chemical or environmental parameters that determine the exposure, thereby allowing the effective prioritization of research or measurements to improve the risk profile; and 4) forecasting future time trends, including how quickly exposure levels in remote areas would respond to reductions in emissions. Currently there is no standardized consensus model for use in the risk profile context. Therefore, to choose the appropriate model the risk profile developer must evaluate how appropriate an existing model is for a specific setting and whether the assumptions and input data are relevant in the context of the application. It is possible to have confidence in the predictions of many of the existing models because of their fundamental physical and chemical, mechanistic underpinnings and the extensive work already done to compare model predictions and empirical observations. The working group recommends that modeling tools be applied for benchmarking PBT and POPs according to exposure-emissions relationships and that modeling tools be used to interpret emissions and monitoring data. The further development of models that combine fate, long-range transport, and bioaccumulation should be fostered, especially models that will allow time trends to be scientifically addressed in the risk profile.

title={Nitrogen dynamics at the sediment-water interface in shallow, sub-tropical Florida Bay: why denitrification efficiency may decrease with increased eutrophication},
abstract={Nitrogen (N) dynamics at the sediment-water interface were examined in four regions of Florida Bay to provide mechanistic information on the fate and effects of increased N inputs to shallow, subtropical, coastal environments. Dissimilatory nitrate (NO3-) reduction to ammonium (DNRA) was hypothesized to be a significant mechanism retaining bioreactive N in this warm, saline coastal ecosystem. Nitrogen dynamics, phosphorus (P) fluxes, and sediment oxygen demand (SOD) were measured in north-central (Rankin Key; eutrophic), north-eastern (Duck Key; high N to P seston ratios), north-western (Murray Key; low N to P ratios), and central (Rabbit Key; typical central site) Florida Bay in August 2004, January 2005, and November 2006. Site water was passed over intact sediment cores, and changes in oxygen (O2), phosphate (o-PO43-), ammonium (NH4+), NO3-, nitrite (NO2-), and N2 concentrations were measured, without and with addition of excess 15NO3 - or 15NH4+ to inflow water. These incubations provided estimates of SOD, nutrient fluxes, N2 production, and potential DNRA rates. Denitrification rates were lowest in summer, when SOD was highest. DNRA rates and NH4+ fluxes were high in summer at the eutrophic Rankin site, when denitrification rates were low and almost no N2 came from added 15NO3 -. Highest 15NH4+ accumulation, resulting from DNRA, occurred at Rabbit Key during a picocyanobacteria bloom in November. 15NH4+ accumulation rates among the stations correlated with SOD in August and January, but not in November during the algal bloom. These mechanistic results help explain why bioreactive N supply rates are sometimes high in Florida Bay and why denitrification efficiency may decrease with increased NO3 - inputs in sub-tropical coastal environments.

abstract={Lectins play a crucial role in the innate immunity of invertebrates and vertebrates by recognizing and disposing of pathogens. We obtained the complete cDNA of a C-type lectin (EALec1) from Epinephelus akaara using RACE. The complete EALec1 cDNA sequence was 827 bp. The 5-UTR and 3-UTR were 28 bp and 151 bp, respectively, in length. The sequence also contained a polyadenylation signal AATAAA and a poly(A) tail. The EALec1 cDNA encodes polypeptides with 215 amino acids, including a signal peptide of 31 amino acids. The protein has a cysteine-rich region at the N terminal, a collagenous region characterized by G-X-Y repeats, a neck region, and a typical carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD), indicating that EALec1 is a collectin. The key recognition positions of this CRD are EPD, isolated for the first time in fish. These are likely the interim types, between mannan-binding lectin and galactose-binding lectin. We evaluated the expression pattern of EALec1 in 12 different tissues using RT-PCR. EALec1 was expressed in all tissues, though at different levels. In addition, we inserted EALec1 into an expression vector (pET-28a) for transformation into the BL21 engineering bacteria. Based on enzyme digestion and sequencing of the positive clone, we successfully constructed the EALec1 recombinant expression vector.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Freshwater clam Corbicula fluminea, a surrogate species in metal toxicity testing, is a promising bioindicator of impairment in aquatic ecosystems. Little is known, however, about the relationship between clam valve daily rhythmic response and metal bioavailability related to a metal biological early warning system (BEWS) design. The purpose of this study was to link biotic ligand model (BLM)-based bioavailability and valve daily rhythm in C. fluminea to design a biomonitoring system for online in situ detection of waterborne copper (Cu). We integrated the Hill-based dose-time-response function and the fitted daily rhythm function of valve closure into a constructed programmatic mechanism. The functional presentation of the present dynamic system was completely demonstrated by employing a LabVIEW graphic control program in a personal computer. We used site-specific effect concentration causing 10% of total valve closure response (EC10) as the detection threshold to implement the proposed C. fluminea-based Cu BEWS. Here our results show that the proposed C. fluminea-based BEWS could be deliberately synthesized to online in situ transmit rapidly the information on waterborne bioavailable Cu levels under various aquatic environmental conditions through monitoring the valve daily rhythmic changes. We suggested that the developed C. fluminea-based dynamic biomonitoring system could assist in developing technically defensible site-specific water quality criteria to promote more efficient uses in water resources for protection of species health in aquatic environments.

The 96<c2><a0>h EC50 was 38.49 and 11.12<c2><a0>mg/l for NOR and BHA, respectively. Growth of S. obliquus was affected slightly under low concentrations of BHA (<4<c2><a0>mg/l) and NOR (<15<c2><a0>mg/l) over the 96<c2><a0>h exposure period. With the increasing concentrations of these two compounds, growth of S. oblique decreased significantly. Growth inhibition was 82.4% at 60.0<c2><a0>mg/l for NOR and 60.6% at 16.0<c2><a0>mg/l for BHA after 96<c2><a0>h. A similar trend was also observed for chlorophyll a. NOR and BHA affected Phase I and Phase II enzyme activities differently. Upon exposure to NOR, EROD was induced at concentration <15.0<c2><a0>mg/l and depressed at concentrations >30<c2><a0>mg/l significantly. CAT and GST exhibited similar trends during the exposure period. Compared to controls, MDA content only showed high induction at high concentrations of NOR (>30<c2><a0>mg/l). However, EROD activity did not display any change compared to control responses during BHA exposure, whereas GST showed significant induction for all concentrations over the exposure period. CAT activity showed induction at low concentration and depression at high concentration. MDA content increased with the rise of BHA during the exposure period. These types of assays, revealing toxic effects of NOR and BHA to phototrophs, could be employed to assess the potential risks of these xenobiotics to aquatic ecological systems.},

The data used include those from five cruises in the Black Sea with the participation of the author, seismo-acoustic data in the possession of the Institute of Oceanology in Varna, and data from the published literature. The most important result is that the water level of the Black Sea is controlled largely by that of the Marmara Sea via the Bosporus sill. The water circulation in the south part of the Bosporus channel as natural regulative mechanism of the Black Sea level during 11800-9000 yr C14 BP is produced. A succession of climatic and water conditions for the Black Sea by pollen analysis is presented. The linear ridges on the Black Sea shelf as result of the lower Holocene regression are proved by means of a stratigraphic interpretation of the seismo-acoustic profiles. The levels of the Black Sea, Marmara Sea, and Mediterranean at regarded intervals of time are presented. An attempt at explanation of maximum number of facts from the study region with this model is made. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Oyster and Macroalgae Bioindicators Detect Elevated [delta]15N in Maryland's Coastal Bays},
abstract={Nitrogen loading from anthropogenic sources, including fertilizer, manure, and sewage effluents, has been linked with declining water quality in coastal lagoons worldwide. Freshwater inputs to mid-Atlantic coastal lagoons of the USA are from terrestrially influenced sources: groundwater and overland flow via streams and agricultural ditches, with occasional precipitation events. Stable nitrogen isotopes ratios (<ce><b4>15N) in bioindicator species combined with conventional water quality monitoring were used to assess nitrogen sources and provide insights into their origins. Water quality data revealed that nutrients derived from terrestrial sources increased after precipitation events. Tissues from two bioindicator species, a macroalgae (Gracilaria sp.) and the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) were analyzed for <ce><b4>15N to determine spatial and temporal patterns of nitrogen sources. A broad-scale survey assessment of deployed macroalgae (June 2004) detected regions of elevated <ce><b4>15N. Macroalgal <ce><b4>15N (7.33<c2><b1>1.15[per thousand] in May 2006 and 6.76<c2><b1>1.15[per thousand] in July 2006) responded quickly to sustained June 2006 nutrient pulse, but did not detect spatial patterns at the fine scale. Oyster <ce><b4>15N (8.51<c2><b1>0.89[per thousand]) responded slowly over longer time periods and exhibited a slight gradient at the finer spatial scale. Overall, elevated <ce><b4>15N values in macroalgae and oysters were used to infer that human and animal wastes were important nitrogen sources in some areas of Maryland's coastal bays. Different nitrogen integration periods across multiple organisms may be used to indicate nitrogen sources at various spatial and temporal scales, which will help focus nutrient management.

abstract={Limnoperna fortunei (golden mussel), a freshwater bivalve native to Southeast Asia, invaded southern South America around 1991. Using species' occurrence records and salinity in different seasons in Laguna dos Patos, RS, Brazil, we predict survival probabilities in different regions of the lagoon during the different seasons of the year. We fitted the data to a logistic regression model. A total of 26 presence records (live, dead) of L. fortunei and salinity at those locations were obtained from the literature for the Laguna dos Patos in the period 2001-2004. Additional data on salinity were used to interpolate salinity values to all regions of the lagoon. The logistic regression model shows that survival decreases as salinity increases. The model predicted high survival probability of the species during periods of low salinity (austral winter) in the limnic, pre-limnic and estuarine regions of the lagoon. During the high salinity period (summer), the species is able to survive only in the limnic and pre-limnic region of the lagoon. These data suggest that control measures should be carried out most effectively during the summer. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={We developed an inductance-based valvometry technique as a detection system to measure the valve daily activity in freshwater clam Corbicula fluminea in response to waterborne arsenic. Our findings reveal that C. fluminea experiences a valve opening in the absence of arsenic predominantly in the morning hours (03:00-08:00) with a mean daily opening/closing period of 21.32 (95% CI: 20.58-22.05) h. Amplification of daily activity occurred in the presence of arsenic. Behavioral toxicity assays revealed arsenic detection thresholds of 0.60 (95% CI: 0.53-0.66) mg<c2><a0>l-1 and 0.35 (95% CI: 0.30-0.40) mg<c2><a0>l-1 for response times of 60 and 300<c2><a0>min, respectively. The proposed valve daily activity model was linked with response time-specific Hill dose-response functions to predict valve opening/closing behavior in response to arsenic. The predictive capabilities were verified satisfactory with the measurements. Our results implicate a biomonitoring system by valve daily activity in C. fluminea to identify safe water uses in areas with elevated arsenic.},

title={Polychlorinated Biphenyls and Hudson River White Perch: Implications for Population-Level Ecological Risk Assessment and Risk Management},
abstract={Risk assessments and risk management decisions concerning risks to wild fish populations resulting from exposures to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and related chemicals have been based primarily on observations of effects of chemicals on individual organisms. Although the development and application of population-level ecological risk-assessment methods is proceeding at a rapid pace, the organism-level approach is still being justified by arguments that population-level ecological risk assessment is in an early stage of development and has not been shown to be reliable. This article highlights the importance of including population-level effects in risk-management decision-making, by examining the effects of exposures to PCBs on fish populations inhabiting the Hudson River, New York, USA, a system in which data have been collected for approximately 30 y concerning both concentrations of PCBs in sediment and fish tissue and the abundance and reproduction of exposed fish populations. We previously tested hypotheses concerning the effects of PCBs on the striped bass population of the Hudson River, and found that the available data conflicted with all of these hypotheses. Here, we report results of similar analyses of effects of historic PCB exposures on the Hudson River white perch population, using an extended data set that recently became available. As with striped bass, we found no correlation between maternal PCB tissue concentrations and any measure of reproductive success in Hudson River white perch during the 30-y period covered by the data set. Together with results of studies performed on fish populations exposed to PCBs at other sites, our results clearly demonstrate that physiological and genetic adaptation, biological compensation, and other ecological processes influence responses of fish populations to PCB exposures and should be considered in risk management decision-making.

title={Genetic evidence for the existence of cryptic species in an endangered clam Coelomactra antiquata},
abstract={Coelomactra antiquata is a commercially important bivalve species, but has been suffering from severe population decline due to over-exploitation and the deterioration of environmental conditions. Previous genetic survey of C. antiquata conducted with allozymes combined with morphology revealed high levels of genetic differentiation between northern and southern populations which suggests a cryptic species might exist in C. antiquata. To test this hypothesis, amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) and 16S rRNA gene sequence were used to re-evaluate the spatial genetic structure of six populations of C. antiquata along the coast of China. Both genetic markers display a sharp genetic break between the four northern populations (northern lineage) and two southern population (southern lineage). Large numbers of private alleles (AFLP) were found within the northern or southern populations and a deep divergence of about 6.5% in 16S rRNA gene sequence between the northern and southern lineages suggests the occurrence of potential cryptic or sibling species of C. antiquata. Applying previously published rates of mutation, divergence between the two lineages is estimated to have occurred approximately 3 million years ago and may be due to allopatric isolation during the middle Pliocene times. While no genetic differentiation was found within the northern or southern populations in both AFLP and 16S mtDNA markers, the results indicate that the northern and southern lineage should be managed separately and any translocation between the two areas should be avoided.

title={Contamination of bivalve haemolymph samples by adductor muscle components: implications for biomarker studies},
abstract={Haemolymph samples and haemocytes collected via the adductor muscles of bivalve molluscs are extensively used in ecotoxicological studies. Withdrawal of haemolymph from mussels, Mytilus edulis, via the posterior adductor muscle, may lead to contamination with the intracellular contents of adductor myocytes. Lysopine dehydrogenase (LyDH) activity, an adductor myocyte marker, was used to investigate the impact of this potential contamination on levels of total glutathione, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) measured in cell-free haemolymph. The mean glutathione content of cell-free haemolymph from 28 mussels was 3.2<c2><a0><c2><b1><c2><a0>1.8<c2><a0><ce><bc>M (mean<c2><a0><c2><b1><c2><a0>SD). There was a linear relationship (slope<c2><a0>=<c2><a0>0.28<c2><a0><c2><b1><c2><a0>0.03<c2><a0>min; mean<c2><a0><c2><b1><c2><a0>SE; P<c2><a0><<c2><a0>0.0001, n<c2><a0>=<c2><a0>28) with haemolymph LyDH levels suggesting that at least some of the glutathione measured in cell-free haemolymph had arisen from contamination. Haemolymph LyDH activity was significantly higher in samples extracted using larger diameter needles, and also in samples where there had been some difficulty in the extraction. Exposure of mussels to oxidative stress using 40<c2><a0><ce><bc>g<c2><a0>l-1 Cu for 5<c2><a0>days resulted in a 1.7 fold increase in glutathione (P<c2><a0>=<c2><a0>0.033), but no increase (P<c2><a0>=<c2><a0>0.810) in LyDH activity in adductor muscle. This was reflected in a similar increase in the slope of a plot of cell-free haemolymph glutathione versus LyDH activity (P<c2><a0>=<c2><a0>0.011), consistent with both of these having originated from the adductor muscle. Cell-free haemolymph GPx and AChE activities also correlated with LyDH activity (Spearman rank correlation coefficients of 0.531 (P<c2><a0>=<c2><a0>0.0068) and 0.537 (P<c2><a0>=<c2><a0>0.0062), respectively, n<c2><a0>=<c2><a0>27) suggesting that these also arise from contamination of the haemolymph. For GPx there was a significant linear relationship (P<c2><a0>=<c2><a0>0.025) with haemolymph LyDH levels consistent with both enzymes originating from the myocytes. However, there was hyperbolic relationship (P<c2><a0>=<c2><a0>0.0004) between haemolymph AChE and LyDH activities. It appears that this is because the AChE originates from a different compartment to the LyDH, i.e. cholinergic neuromuscular junctions in the adductor muscle. We conclude that it would be prudent, when considering the possibility of using a biomarker in cell-free haemolymph from bivalve molluscs, to check whether contamination could be an issue.},

title={Depositional history of the Miocene Lake Sinj (Dinaride Lake System, Croatia): a long-lived hard-water lake in a pull-apart tectonic setting},
abstract={Early Miocene transpressional wrenching yielded a series of NW-SE-elongated pull-apart basins in the Dinarides of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. They accommodated a huge lake system that gave rise to spectacular endemic mollusk radiation. Lake Sinj, moderately sized at 342<c2><a0>km2, flooded the south-westernmost basin of this system. Due to the karstic environment, the hard-water, alkaline, long-lived lake developed a sediment infill with an average thickness of 370<c2><a0>m, dominated by authigenic limestone. The studied section represents the upper third of the basinal infill and provides detailed insights into the critical period of the lake and of the basinal evolution during the final stages of its filling. It comprises two large-scale, shallowing-upward cycles, both starting with fossil-poor limestones, gradually passing into coal-bearing carbonate rocks and coal seams. The fossil-poor intervals are interpreted as phases of repetitive acidification events due to changing lake level, which induced periodic drying and flooding of the uppermost littoral zone inhabited by starfruit (Damasonium) meadows. The flooding of the aerated, limy mud plain introduced H+<c2><a0>ions from organic-matter decay reactions into the shallow lake. This decreased its pH level, with catastrophic consequences for its biota. The ecosystem then stabilized during the orbitally-forced, dry climate phases. Based on the mollusk record, streams still influenced the marginal lake environment and rich organic-matter production created swamps and mires. The onset of mollusk radiation in the section correlates with stabilized lake alkalinity, as indicated by the disappearance of starfruits, ongoing authigenic carbonate production and by coal seams representing textbook examples for coal formation in alkaline environments. The inferred basinal setting fits well with the pull-apart basin model, pointing to the presence of an extended shallow ramp in front of a steep, fault-induced hillside of the hinterland.

title={Challenges to incorporating spatially and temporally explicit phenomena (hotspots and hot moments) in denitrification models},
abstract={Issue Title: New approaches to modeling denitrification Denitrification, the anaerobic reduction of nitrogen oxides to nitrogenous gases, is an extremely challenging process to measure and model. Much of this challenge arises from the fact that small areas (hotspots) and brief periods (hot moments) frequently account for a high percentage of the denitrification activity that occurs in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. In this paper, we describe the prospects for incorporating hotspot and hot moment phenomena into denitrification models in terrestrial soils, the interface between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and in aquatic ecosystems. Our analysis suggests that while our data needs are strongest for hot moments, the greatest modeling challenges are for hotspots. Given the increasing availability of high temporal frequency climate data, models are promising tools for evaluating the importance of hot moments such as freeze-thaw cycles and drying/rewetting events. Spatial hotspots are less tractable due to our inability to get high resolution spatial approximations of denitrification drivers such as carbon substrate. Investigators need to consider the types of hotspots and hot moments that might be occurring at small, medium, and large spatial scales in the particular ecosystem type they are working in before starting a study or developing a new model. New experimental design and heterogeneity quantification tools can then be applied from the outset and will result in better quantification and more robust and widely applicable denitrification models.

title={Age-Dependent Bioaccumulation of Organochlorine Compounds in Fish and their Selective Biotransformation in Top Predators from Lake Maggiore (Italy)},
abstract={Fish and piscivorous bird eggs collected in 2003 from Lake Maggiore (Italy), were analysed for PCB and DDT contamination. Lake Maggiore has been severely polluted by DDT through production of the pesticide within its catchment. Although agricultural application of DDT was banned in Italy in the 1978, industrial production continued until 1996, with enough contamination of water and soil for serious bioaccumulation in the lake biota. PCB and DDT concentrations in a whitefish (Coregonus macrophthalmus Nusslin 1882) were seen to be dependent on season and fish age, but not on sex. The average increase of the lipid-normalised concentration of DDTs and PCBs was two-fold across season and also across age, resulting in an overall increase of four fold. The seasonal variation was related to the eco-physiological cycle of the fish and to the contamination dynamic of the lake, while the effect of the fish age was explained on the base of biomagnification-related mechanisms. A fugacity model was applied to predict the age-dependent bioaccumulation potential of PCBs, whose concentrations were rather stable in recent years in the lake. Predicted values for compounds with negligible biotransformation were in good agreement with experimental data (calculated vs. experimental mean difference of 14%), and a relationship between the increase of experimental age-dependent concentration and Kow was observed. The good correspondence between the predicted and the measured values for most PCB congeners confirmed the general inability of fishes to biotransform these compounds. On the contrary, the importance of biotransformation processes was recognised in birds; eggs of a fish eating bird (Podiceps cristatus) from the same area selectively bioaccumulated p,p'-DDE. For PCBs, congener 149 appears to be completely metabolized by the bird species, and congeners 95, 101, 132, 151 and 174 were reduced as well. The role of the meta-para free position on at least one phenyl ring of PCB congeners in biotransformation processes was confirmed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

There were no consistent or significant differences among the major groups of fish, including carp, catfish, mullet, and tilapia. There was a strong positive correlation (R 2=0.84) between the average <ce><b4>15N values of fish muscle and estimated water residence time among the lagoons. This preliminary evidence suggests that nitrogen cycle transformations may be more important than primary N source differences in determining N isotopic ratios of organisms in the lagoons. The <ce><b4>13C results point to the probable importance of autochthonous particulate organic matter rather than terrestrial detritus or marine plankton in the diets of resident fish populations in the lagoons.

title={Seston Removal by Natural and Constructed Intertidal Eastern Oyster (Crassostrea virginica) Reefs: A Comparison with Previous Laboratory Studies, and the Value of in situ Methods},
abstract={An important ecological role ascribed to oysters is the transfer of materials from the water column to the benthos as they feed on suspended particles (seston). This ecosystem service has been often touted as a major reason for many oyster restoration efforts, but empirical characterization and quantification of seston removal rates in the field have been lacking. Changes in chlorophyll a (chl a) concentrations in the water column were measured in May 2005 and June 2006 in South Carolina using in situ fluorometry and laboratory analysis of pumped water samples taken upstream and downstream as water flowed over natural and constructed intertidal oyster reefs. Both methods gave similar results overall, but with wide variability within individual reef datasets. In situ fluorometer data logged at 10 to 30-s intervals for up to 1.3<c2><a0>h over eight different reefs (three natural and five constructed) showed total removal (or uptake) expressed as % removal of chl a ranging from -9.8% to 27.9%, with a mean of 12.9%. Our data indicate that restored shellfish reefs should provide water-quality improvements soon after construction, and the overall impact is probably determined by the size and density of the resident filter feeder populations relative to water flow characteristics over the reef. The measured population-level chl a removal was converted to mean individual clearance rates to allow comparison with previous laboratory studies. Although direct comparisons could not be made due to the small size of oysters on the study reefs (mean shell height, 36.1<c2><a0>mm), our calculated rates (mean, 1.21<c2><a0>L h-1) were similar to published laboratory measured rates for oysters of this size. However, the wide variability in measured removal by the oyster reefs suggests that individual oyster feeding rates in nature may be much more variable than in the laboratory. The proliferation of ecosystem-level models that simulate the impacts of bivalves on water quality based only on laboratory-feeding measurements underscores the importance of further research aimed at determining ecologically realistic feeding rates for oysters in the field. Because in situ methods provide many replicate measurements quickly, they represent a potentially powerful tool for quantifying the effects of oyster reefs, including all suspension-feeding taxa present, on water quality.

title={Larval history influences post-metamorphic condition in a coral-reef fish},
abstract={Upon settlement, many fishes undergo an energetically costly metamorphic period that requires substantial nutritional reserves. Larval growth and the accumulation of lipids prior to metamorphosis are likely to influence growth and survival following this critical period. On the Caribbean island of St. Croix, I investigated relationships between larval growth, early life-history characteristics, and post-metamorphic lipid content in the bluehead wrasse Thalassoma bifasciatum. Lipid reserves remaining after metamorphosis were positively related (r 2<c2><a0>=<c2><a0>0.62) to the width of the metamorphic band; thus, this otolith-derived trait may be used to estimate the condition at emergence of survivors collected at some later time. In contrast, pelagic larval duration, average larval growth, and otolith size at settlement were negatively related to post-metamorphic lipid content. Interestingly, the trend for slower growth among fish in good condition was not consistent over the entire pelagic larval duration. Analyses of daily larval growth histories indicated that fish with high lipid reserves grew rapidly in the last week prior to settlement, but relatively slowly during the early phases of larval life; those emerging with low lipid concentrations, however, displayed strikingly opposite patterns. These contrasting patterns of growth and energy storage were consistent at two sites and over three recruitment events. Otolith chemistry data suggested that differences in growth histories and body condition were consistent with the hypothesis of larval development in distinct oceanic environments (characterized by Pb concentration); but, within a water mass, differences reflected life-history trade-offs between growth and energy storage. The results have implications for understanding the processes driving juvenile survival, which may be condition dependent.},

title={Spatial and seasonal patterns in water quality in an embayment-mainstem reach of the tidal freshwater Potomac River, USA: a multiyear study},
abstract={Spatial and temporal patterns in water quality were studied for seven years within an embayment-river mainstem area of the tidal freshwater Potomac River. The purpose of this paper is to determine the important components of spatial and temporal variation in water quality in this study area to facilitate an understanding of management impacts and allow the most effective use of future monitoring resources. The study area received treated sewage effluent and freshwater inflow from direct tributary inputs into the shallow embayment as well as upriver sources in the mainstem. Depth variations were determined to be detectable, but minimal due mainly to the influence of tidal mixing. Results of principal component analysis of two independent water quality datasets revealed clear spatial and seasonal patterns. Interannual variation was generally minimal despite substantial variations in tributary and mainstem discharge among years. Since both spatial and seasonal components were important, data were segmented by season to best determine the spatial pattern. A clear difference was found between a set of stations located within one embayment (Gunston Cove) and a second set in the nearby Potomac mainstem. Parameters most highly correlated with differences were those typically associated with higher densities of phytoplankton: chlorophyll a, photosynthetic rate, pH, dissolved oxygen, BOD, total phosphorus and Secchi depth. These differences and their consistency indicated two distinct water masses: one in the cove harboring higher algal density and activity and a second in the river with lower phytoplankton activity. A second embayment not receiving sewage effluent generally had an intermediate position. While this was the most consistent spatial pattern, there were two others of a secondary nature. Stations closer to the effluent inputs in the embayment sometimes grouped separately due to elevated ammonia and chloride. Stations closer to tributary inflows into the embayment sometimes grouped separately due to dilution with freshwater runoff. Segmenting the datasets by spatial region resulted in a clarification of seasonal patterns with similar factors relating to algal activity being the major correlates of the seasonal pattern. A basic seasonal pattern of lower scores in the spring increasing steadily to a peak in July and August followed by a steady decline through the fall was observed in the cove. In the river, the pattern of increases tended to be delayed slightly in the spring. Results indicate that the study area can be effectively monitored with fewer study sites provided that at least one is located in each of the spatial regions. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Carbon isotopes in mollusk shell carbonates},
abstract={Mollusk shells contain many isotopic clues about calcification physiology and environmental conditions at the time of shell formation. In this review, we use both published and unpublished data to discuss carbon isotopes in both bivalve and gastropod shell carbonates. Land snails construct their shells mainly from respired CO2, and shell [delta]13C reflects the local mix of C3 and C4 plants consumed. Shell [delta]13C is typically >10[per thousand] heavier than diet, probably because respiratory gas exchange discards CO2, and retains the isotopically heavier HCO3-. Respired CO2 contributes less to the shells of aquatic mollusks, because CO2/O2 ratios are usually higher in water than in air, leading to more replacement of respired CO2 by environmental CO2. Fluid exchange with the environment also brings additional dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) into the calcification site. Shell [delta]13C is typically a few [per thousand] lower than ambient DIC, and often decreases with age. Shell [delta]13C retains clues about processes such as ecosystem metabolism and estuarine mixing. Ca2+ ATPase-based models of calcification physiology developed for corals and algae likely apply to mollusks, too, but lower pH and carbonic anhydrase at the calcification site probably suppress kinetic isotope effects. Carbon isotopes in biogenic carbonates are clearly complex, but cautious interpretation can provide a wealth of information, especially after vital effects are better understood.

title={The Lake Michigan Eutrophication Model, LM3-Eutro: Model Development and Calibration},
abstract={A eutrophication model developed to generate primary-production estimates in Lake Michigan can simulate 17 state variables, including three plankton classes and several nutrients. The model, known as the Lake Michigan Eutrophication model (LM3-Eutro), has a high-resolution computational grid that enables good spatial description of spring temperature and phytoplankton concentrations, which have significant gradients in the lakes. The grid also allows the model to predict concentrations in nearshore areas and other regions of interest. The model provided more accurate estimates of algal light limitation based on three-hour intervals compared to daily averages that are used in most eutrophication models, especially during sunny summer days when algal photo-inhibition often occurs. Model output was compared to field data using statistical parameters such as squares of the correlation coefficients to determine the best model fit. The calibrated model output fit the field data reasonably well for nutrients and phytoplankton, which provided confidence in the framework, governing equations, and coefficients used.

title={Secretion of byssal threads and attachment strength of Mytilus galloprovincialis: the influence of size and food availability},
abstract={Byssogenesis rate and attachment strength of the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis were investigated in the laboratory considering different body sizes and feeding conditions. Byssal thread secretion was significantly higher in juveniles as compared to larger mussels of approximately 87<c2><a0>mm shell length. Asymptotic number of threads attached was obtained from approximately 72 hours onwards within a range of 42-46 and 27-31 for juveniles and larger experimental mussels, respectively (P<c2><a0><<c2><a0>0.05 ANOVA). Absorption efficiency values of control fed individuals dropped significantly from 0.78 in juveniles to 0.70 in larger mussels (P<c2><a0><<c2><a0>0.001 ANOVA) which pointed out energetic constraints of mussels with regard to their size and its probable effect on byssus secretion rates. Attachment force was 2.8 times higher in larger mussels than in juveniles (2.21 versus 0.78<c2><a0>N for both sizes, respectively; P<c2><a0><<c2><a0>0.001 ANOVA) which in turn followed the same order of magnitude than differences in the thread's thickness values of both experimental mussel sizes. Tenacity followed a reverse pattern with juveniles presenting two-fold higher values than larger mussels (P<c2><a0><<c2><a0>0.001 ANOVA) based on a lower increment of attachment force (x2.8) as compared to shell area (x6) for the comparison larger versus juvenile mussel size, which in turn might suggest that larger specimens secreted weaker threads. When animals were maintained unfed for a week, a significant drop in both byssus secretion and attachment force were observed in juveniles but was not the case for larger mussels most likely as a consequence of a relatively short period of maintenance under food availability stress for the latter individuals that showed significantly higher initial condition and/or energetic store values. Accordingly, the use of energetic reserves in juveniles kept unfed for a week together with a significant drop in byssus secretion and attachment force might suggest a link, i.e. transfer of energy between soft tissues and byssus under stress. Quantitative values of byssal threads, based on the significance of the byssus versus attachment force relationship, together with its morphometric value, i.e. thread's thickness, represented a primary mechanism to explain variability in attachment strength of M. galloprovincialis of the different body sizes studied here.

abstract={Calyptogena gallardoi is a recently described species of vesicomyid clam associated to the extensive gas-hydrate field reported for the Chilean margin along 35<c2><b0>S to 45<c2><b0>S. Enzymatic analysis in foot, gill and abductor muscle tissues of C. gallardoi collected in central-south Chile (~36<c2><b0>21[variant prime]S 73<c2><b0>44[variant prime]W), show high activities for malate dehydrogenase (MDH), strombine dehydrogenase (STRDH) and alanopine dehydrogenase (ALPDH) and a low activity of citrate synthase (CS) and ETS (electron transport system). Positive significant correlations (log-log scale) were found between enzymatic activities involved in anaerobic metabolism (MDH versus LDH and ALPDH versus STRDH), as well as between CS and opines dehydrogenases. The ratio MDH/LDH or any other opine dehydrogenase assayed was >> 1 in all tissues analysed. These results indicate that C. gallardoi is highly adapted to the harsh anaerobic conditions of marine chemosynthesis-based communities inhabiting a reduced environment. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Biogeochemical response of organic-rich freshwater marshes in the Louisiana delta plain to chronic river water influx},
abstract={To help evaluate effects of Mississippi River inputs to sustainability of coastal Louisiana ecosystems, we compared porewater and substrate quality of organic-rich Panicum hemitomon freshwater marshes inundated by river water annually for more than 30<c2><a0>years (Penchant basin, PB) or not during the same time (Barataria basin, BB). In the marshes receiving river water the soil environment was more reduced, the organic substrate was more decomposed and accumulated more sulfur. The porewater dissolved ammonium and orthophosphate concentrations were an order of magnitude higher and sulfide and alkalinity concentrations were more than twice as high in PB compared with BB marshes. The pH was higher and dissolved iron concentrations were more than an order of magnitude lower in PB marshes than in BB marshes. The influx of nutrient-rich river water did not enhance end-of-year above-ground standing biomass or vertical accretion rates of the shallow substrate. The differences in porewater chemistry and substrate quality are reasonably linked to the long-term influx of river water through biogeochemical processes and transformations involving alkalinity, nitrate and sulfate. The key factor is the continual replenishment of alkalinity, nitrate and sulfate via overland flow during high river stage each year for several weeks to more than 6<c2><a0>months. This leads to a reducing soil environment, pooling of the phytotoxin sulfide and inorganic nutrients in porewater, and internally generated alkalinity. Organic matter decomposition is enhanced under these conditions and root mats degraded. The more decomposed root mat makes these marshes more susceptible to erosion during infrequent high-energy events (for example hurricanes) and regular low-energy events, such as tides and the passage of weather fronts. Our findings were unexpected and, if generally applicable, suggest that river diversions may not be the beneficial mitigating agent of wetland restoration and conservation that they are anticipated to be.

title={Longitudinal changes in zooplankton distribution below a reservoir outfall with reference to river planktivory},
abstract={The fate and interactions with river organisms of zooplankton as they drift downriver from a reservoir on a fourth-order mountain stream (Hiji River, Japan) were investigated. Monthly samples were collected at the reservoir and six river sites, simultaneously, from May 2005 to May 2006. Aquatic macroinvertebrates and fish were colleted, and their stomach contents were analyzed in April and May, 2006, respectively. Drift from the reservoir was the primary source for the river plankton community; the abundance of zooplankton, particularly those of cladocerans and large rotifer, rapidly decreased within several kilometers of the dam. Analysis of the contents of fish stomachs showed that drifting zooplankton was the main food for fish, with strong food selectivity for cladocerans and large rotifers. However, fish and insect planktivores showed longitudinally different stomach contents, with progressively fewer zooplankton found in the stomachs at the downriver sites. The results suggest that the outflow of zooplankton from the reservoir is an important food source for the downstream predators, especially fish, but the drift of zooplankton and consequent food availability for the predators at lower sites are strongly limited by concentrated fish predation just below the reservoir dam.

title={Bottom-water Hypoxia Effects on Sediment-Water Interface Nitrogen Transformations in a Seasonally Hypoxic, Shallow Bay (Corpus Christi Bay, TX, USA)},
abstract={Bottom-water hypoxia effects on sediment-water interface nitrogen (N) transformations in Corpus Christi Bay (TX, USA) were examined using continuous-flow intact sediment core incubations. Sediment cores were collected from three sites in August 2002 (summer hypoxia) and April 2003 (normoxia). Oxygen (O^sub 2^) and hydrogen sulfide (H^sub 2^S) depth profiles were generated with microelectrodes. Membrane inlet mass spectrometry was used to measure sediment O^sub 2^ demand and net N^sub 2^ flux and combined with isotope pairing to determine potential denitrification and N fixation. Potential dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) was measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. Sediment O^sub 2^ penetration depths ranged from 5 to 10<c2><a0>mm. H^sub 2^S ranged from being present in overlying water and throughout the sediment column in August to not detectable in overlying water or sediment in April. Sediment O^sub 2^ demand was higher during bottom-water normoxia conditions versus hypoxia. Sediments were a significant source of NH^sub 4^+ to overlying water during hypoxia but not during normoxia. Net N^sub 2^ fixation was observed at one station in August and all stations in April. Denitrification rates were significantly higher during hypoxia at two of three sites. Potential DNRA was observed during both oxic states, but rates were significantly higher during hypoxia, which may reflect sulfide enhancement and absence of cation exchange with ^sup 14^NH^sub 4^+. DNRA may contribute to formation and maintenance of bottom-water hypoxic events in this system. These results show that N transformation pathways and rates change when bottom-water O2 concentrations drop to hypoxic levels. Since south Texas is a semiarid region with few episodic runoff events, these results indicate that Corpus Christi Bay sediments are a N source most of the year, and denitrification may drive N limitation between episodic runoff events.

title={Effectiveness and Kinetics of Ferrate as a Disinfectant for Ballast Water},
abstract={This study examined whether ferrate could meet the international standards for successful ballast water treatment, including final concentrations of less than 1 CFU/mL of Enterococci, less than 2.5 CFU/mL of Escherichia coli, and less than 1 CFU/100 mL of Vibrio cholerae. Pure cultures of E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and V. cholerae, and a mixed culture of Enterococcus faecium and E. faecilis were grown in saline solution to simulate ballast water and were treated with dosages of ferrate ranging from 0.25 to 5.0 mg/L. A ferrate dose of 5 mg/L resulted in complete disinfection of all organisms tested, and smaller dosages were also very effective. Tailing was consistently observed, and the Hom's model (1972) appeared to most accurately represent the action of ferrate on these organisms. Salinity and pH did not adversely affect results, and regrowth was not a problem. Ferrate shows good potential as an effective disinfectant in the treatment of ballast water. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Population genetic structure of North American Ophiactis spp. brittle stars possessing hemoglobin},
abstract={With the discovery of previously unreported populations of hemoglobin-possessing Ophiactis from the Texas coast in the Gulf of Mexico, an investigation into its population structure, including populations of O. simplex from the Pacific coast of California and O. rubropoda from the Atlantic coast of Florida, was undertaken using DNA sequence data from the mitochondrial COI gene. The reconstructed haplotype network suggests that California populations contain the ancestral source of mtDNA variation, and there is no evidence of recent introductions into Texas. Population genetic analyses reveal the California, Florida, and Texas Ophiactis populations to each be significantly differentiated from one another. Sequence divergence among the three areas is shallower than would be predicted given biogeographic history. Texas and Florida populations are equally genetically diverged from California populations as they are to one another, despite the greater potential for gene flow between these areas. The genetic distinctiveness of the Texas populations and the concordance of this pattern with phylogeographic patterns in other brittle star systems indicate an isolated and independent evolutionary history and we hypothesize that the three geographic regions included in this study each serve as hypotheses of population-level lineages that remain to be tested with independent sources of data.

abstract={Trophic patterns of omnivorous freshwater shrimps, Exopalaemon modestus and Macrobrachium nipponensis, were investigated in two shallow eutrophic lakes by using stable isotope analysis. <ce><b4>15N and <ce><b4>13C of M. nipponensis and E. modestus increased with increasing body weight, which might be attributed to larger individuals ingesting organisms that feed higher up the food chain and/or increased assimilation of benthic food items with enriched isotopic signatures. Of the freshwater shrimps occurring in the studied lakes, those from Lake Taihu had significantly elevated <ce><b4>15N and <ce><b4>13C values (4.3[per thousand] and 1.8[per thousand], respectively) compared with those from the less eutrophic Lake Chaohu, indicating that the isotopic signature might partially reflect the trophic states of their habitats. Mixing model results suggested that the benthic food web provides the primary carbon source for both shrimp species, and that E. modestus assimilated relatively more pelagic food sources than M. nipponensis in these lakes.

title={Evaluating the utility of stable isotope analyses of archived freshwater sample materials},
abstract={We evaluated the potential utility of stable isotope analysis of tissues commonly archived by aquatic biologists. Previous studies with chemically preserved samples have shown contradictory results, which present an obstacle for the use of archived sample materials. We tested the effects of ethanol and formalin preservation on zooplankton and of ethanol on benthic macroinvertebrate <ce><b4>13C and <ce><b4>15N values. We found that neither formalin nor ethanol had a significant effect on <ce><b4>13C and <ce><b4>15N values of preserved zooplankton. Nor did ethanol significantly affect <ce><b4>13C or <ce><b4>15N values of macroinvertebrates. However, ethanol preservation slightly, but significantly decreased C:N ratios of both zooplankton and macroinvertebrates, probably reflecting some extraction of lipids. Overall, the effects of preservatives on <ce><b4>13C and <ce><b4>15N values that we observed were minor. We also compared <ce><b4>13C and <ce><b4>15N values analysed from roach scales and perch operculum bones with those analysed from muscle tissue. Decalcification of scales and operculum bones only slightly improved our comparison to muscle tissue <ce><b4>13C and <ce><b4>15N values. Decalcified scales had slightly higher <ce><b4>13C and lower <ce><b4>15N values. Similarly, decalcified operculum bones showed slightly increased <ce><b4>13C and decreased <ce><b4>15N values to those for fish muscle. Our results confirm that scales and operculum bones can provide a suitable proxy for fish muscle in isotope studies with minor correction. We conclude that various archived sample materials can indeed be used with confidence for historical reconstructions of freshwater food webs by stable isotope analysis. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={The concentrations of metals (Ca, Cd, Fe, Mn, Pb and Zn) were determined by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry in water, sediments and fish samples in the Ogun river catchments, Ketu, Lagos, which is an important bird nesting, fishing and drinking water source. The results show that the southern tip bothering the Lagos lagoon is where the highest metal concentrations are found in the fish species (Tilapia sp. and Chrysichthys sp.), whereas the Agboyi creek segment near the lagoon with higher surrounding human population density recorded higher levels of metals in sediments and water samples. The two fish species accumulated different amounts of metals. However, the differences were not statistically different at p<0.05. There is a significant correlation (p<0.05) for Cd concentration in water. The concentrations of Pb in sampling points 3 and 4 as well as Cd, Mn and Fe in all six sampling points exceeds the World Health Organization (WHO) limits for drinking water. Levels of metals obtained for sediments are within the range reported for Nigeria's river sediments. Based on this study, the human risks for heavy metals in the harvested fish species from the Ogun river catchments, Ketu, are low for now as the concentrations were below the recommended Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) maximum limits for Pb (0.5<c2><a0>mg/Kg), Cd (0.5<c2><a0>mg/Kg), and Zn (30<c2><a0>mg/Kg) in fish.

title={POPs in Mountain Soils from the Alps and Andes: Suggestions for a 'Precipitation Effect' on Altitudinal Gradients},
abstract={POPs are still a priority environmental problem, but can be used as a scientific tool for understanding the distribution phenomena. Both high mountains and polar areas are seen as priority zones for contamination studies. In this context, two altitudinal series of soil samples were analysed for several classes of Persistent Organic Pollutants (PCBs, DDTs, HCHs, HCB and chlordane). Two transects were carried out - one in the Peruvian Andes (Cordillera Blanca) and the other in the Italian Alps (Mount Legnone). In these two areas, POP composition and levels both gave different results, linked to regional emission history. The Italian samples were characterized by high levels of industrial type compounds, and by surprisingly high DDT contamination, due to a defined consistent local source in Northern Italy. The Peruvian samples, on the other hand, were characterized by generally low POP levels with relatively high DDT contamination. The concentration increase in line with elevation was evident only in the Italian transect, where higher precipitation intensities and an increasingly higher precipitation gradient in accordance with altitude was found present. Precipitations are considered a key factor for enhancing the condensation effect at high altitudes and for reducing summer revolatilisation, as they lower soil temperature. In the Italian altitudinal gradient, evidence of fractionation processes, with a shift of the PCB composition towards less chlorinated congeners, and a vegetation effect with a mean woodland/grassland enrichment factor between 2 and 4 were also observed.

title={Shell gaping behaviour of Pinna nobilis L., 1758: circadian and circalunar rhythms revealed by in situ monitoring},
abstract={Gaping activity of bivalve molluscs is closely related to physiological process such as breathing, nutrition, responses to environmental stimuli and follows rhythmic cycles in many species. Although the alternation of Sun and Moon is the major entraining agent for the daily living clock-driven rhythms, cyclic extrinsic environmental factors can also modulate gaping activity. Therefore, laboratory experimental conditions can alter the natural behaviour of bivalves, hindering the interpretation of observations. Many features of Pinna nobilis physiology are poorly known, gaping activity not being an exception. To reduce the knowledge gap on this regard, we performed a study on the species gaping activity. The research was designed to be carried out in situ, in order to avoid the interference of laboratory conditions in the observations. To this end, we designed and fabricated a new electronic system composed by a data logger and a sensor formed by multiple reed switches activated by a single magnet. The system is autonomous and can record gaping activity of subtidal bivalves in potentially any type of subtidal environment. Furthermore, it requires little framework for the installation. With this system, we monitored 10 individuals in periods ranging between 3 and 21<c2><a0>days, for up to a total of 98<c2><a0>days. The records have shown that far from being all day open, as previously suggested, P. nobilis follows marked circadian and circalunar rhythms of gaping activity. Individuals usually close the valves during night, sometimes for more than 12<c2><a0>h. The repetition of patterns observed made it possible to distinguish between two main behaviours: (1) night-closing related with sunset and (2) night-opening related with the Moon visible in the sky with the disc illuminated more than 50%. Another two less common trends were also observed: (3) day-closing and (4) night-opening with no visible Moon. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Wetlands are often highly effective nitrogen (N) sinks. In the Lake Waco Wetland (LWW), near Waco, Texas, USA, nitrate (NO 3 - ) concentrations are reduced by more than 90% in the first 500<c2><a0>m downstream of the inflow, creating a distinct gradient in NO 3 - concentration along the flow path of water. The relative importance of sediment denitrification (DNF), dissimilatory NO 3 - reduction to ammonium (DNRA), and N2 fixation were examined along the NO 3 - concentration gradient in the LWW. "Potential DNF" (hereafter potDNF) was observed in all months and ranged from 54 to 278<c2><a0><ce><bc>mol<c2><a0>N<c2><a0>m-2<c2><a0>h-1. "Potential DNRA" (hereafter potDNRA) was observed only in summer months and ranged from 1.3 to 33<c2><a0><ce><bc>mol<c2><a0>N<c2><a0>m-2<c2><a0>h-1. Net N2 flux ranged from 184 (net denitrification) to -270 (net N2 fixation) <ce><bc>mol<c2><a0>N<c2><a0>m-2<c2><a0>h-1. Nitrogen fixation was variable, ranging from 0 to 426<c2><a0><ce><bc>mol<c2><a0>N<c2><a0>m-2<c2><a0>h-1, but high rates ranked among the highest reported for aquatic sediments. On average, summer potDNRA comprised only 5% (<c2><b1>2% SE) of total NO 3 - loss through dissimilatory pathways, but was as high as 36% at one site where potDNF was consistently low. Potential DNRA was higher in sediments with higher sediment oxygen demand (r 2<c2><a0>=<c2><a0>0.84), and was related to NO 3 - concentration in overlying water in one summer (r 2<c2><a0>=<c2><a0>0.81). Sediments were a NO 3 - sink and accounted for 50% of wetland NO 3 - removal (r 2<c2><a0>=<c2><a0>0.90). Sediments were an NH 4 + source, but the wetland was often a net NH 4 + sink. Although DNRA rates in freshwater wetlands may rival those observed in estuarine systems, the importance of DNRA in freshwater sediments appears to be minor relative to DNF. Furthermore, sediment N2 fixation can be extremely high when NO 3 - in overlying water is consistently low. The data suggest that newly fixed N can support sustained N transformation processes such as DNF and DNRA when surface water inorganic N supply rates are low. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Mytilus galloprovincialis as a Bioindicator of Microbiological Pollution of Coastal Waters: A Study Conducted in the Salento Peninsula (Italy)},
abstract={One of the problems dealing with traditional water-monitoring methods is the need to collect water samples at the precise moment that faecal contamination is actually present; for this reason, the use of Mytilus galloprovincialis as an indicator of previously high bacteria concentrations in coastal seawaters was examined. These molluscs are able to integrate the fluctuations in pollutants, they are good representatives of the sampling area because they are sedentary, and they offer the advantage of being resistant to pollution. The research was conducted from September 2001 to October 2002, twice a month, in two coastal areas of Salento (Apulia, Italy), near the discharge channels. We analysed both natural and cultivated mussels. The latter were placed in cages, after checking their starting level of microbiological pollution. Bacteriological analyses were conducted simultaneously on mussels and their ambient water to detect total coliforms, faecal coliforms, faecal streptococci, and Escherichia coli. The abundance of bacteria investigated was always higher within mussels than in the surrounding water where levels were sometimes undetectable. These results confirm the ability of mussels to concentrate and to retain bacteria into their tissues (recorders of present or even past microbiological pollution). Therefore, mussels can enable to detect a bacterial contamination that might be missed by standard water-monitoring methods, and we suggest they be included in routine microbiological investigations of coastal seawaters even in areas where these species aren't widely distributed.

abstract={Periods of isolation during which animals have no social contact are common in the design of behavioral experiments. They are used, for example, to test memory and recognition responses, or to ensure a baseline condition before experimental manipulations commence. We investigated the effect of isolation periods on the aggressive behavior of matched pairs of the crayfish Cherax destructor in two contexts. The first experiment tested the effects of a period of isolation between two encounters. The second experiment tested the effects of isolation before an encounter by pairing one crayfish from a communal living environment with another crayfish from an isolated one. Fight outcome and aggression levels were analyzed, resulting in three conclusions about the social biology of C. destructor. First, encounters between familiar opponents are influenced by the outcome of the familiarization fight for about 2 weeks. Second, the level of aggression and the outcome of an encounter are affected over different time frames. Third, individuals that are isolated before an encounter can be disadvantaged. These data suggest that isolation, or events that occur during periods of isolation, affect multiple elements of social behavior in C. destructor. This suggestion has implications for the interpretation of previous results and future studies in crustaceans and other taxa. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Grazing of two toxic Planktothrix species by Daphnia pulicaria: potential for bloom control and transfer of microcystins},
abstract={The role of zooplankton in the control of cyanobacterial blooms and the transfer of cyanotoxins to higher trophic levels are of great importance to the management of water resources. Many studies have focused on the cyanobacterium Microcystis, but few have examined the interactions between zooplankton and filamentous cyanobacteria. In this study, we provide experimental evidence for the potential grazing of two toxic strains of filamentous cyanobacteria, Planktothrix rubescens and P. agardhii, by Daphnia pulicaria, and for transfer of toxins in the planktonic food chain. We determined clearance rates (CRs) by adult and juvenile D. pulicaria of the two Planktothrix strains, Scenedesmus acutus and a mixture of S. acutus cells with P. rubescens culture filtrate. Filament lengths were analyzed, and microcystin (MCY) presence in Daphnia was assessed using the Protein Phosphatase-2A (PP-2A) Inhibition Assay. The two Planktothrix strains were equally grazed by D. pulicaria, but at lower CRs than S. acutus. Potential anti-grazer toxins in P. rubescens filtrate did not inhibit Daphnia grazing. Small P. rubescens (<100 <ce><bc>m) filaments were preferentially grazed by adult D. pulicaria, suggesting their limited ability to control a Planktothrix population during a bloom. Large quantities of MCYs were found in unstarved Daphnia previously exposed to Planktothrix, whereas quantities were significantly smaller in individuals starved for 24 h before preservation. This indicated a potential for transfer of toxins in the food chain by Daphnia, especially immediately after ingestion of toxic cyanobacteria.},

title={A Phaeocystis globosa bloom associated with upwelling in the subtropical South Atlantic Bight},
abstract={We observed an unusual, subtropical bloom of Phaeocystis globosa Scherffel during a strong upwelling event and confirmed its identity using morphological, physiological and genetic traits. This low-latitude bloom of P. globosa colonies occurred on the South Atlantic Bight continental shelf during the summer of 2003. Maximum chlorophyll a concentration measured during this subsurface bloom was 11.37 <ce><bc>g L-1 at 31 m depth. Divers reported abundant flocculent material below the steep thermocline, and this material was identified as Phaeocystis sp. using microscopy. Using morphological and physiological traits as well as the sequence of the 18S small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (GenBank Accession # EF100712), this phytoplankton was identified as P. globosa. Interactions of physical and biological conditions may restrict low-latitude P. globosa blooms to strong upwelling events.},

title={Spatial and temporal genetic homogeneity in the Arctic surfclam (Mactromeris polynyma)},
abstract={Commercially harvested marine bivalve populations show a broad range of population-genetic patterns that may be driven by planktonic larval dispersal (gene flow) or by historical (genetic drift) and ecological processes (selection). We characterized microsatellite genetic variation among populations and year classes of the commercially harvested Arctic surfclam, Mactromeris polynyma, in order to test the relative significance of gene flow and drift on three spatial scales: within commercially harvested populations in the northwest Atlantic; among Atlantic populations; and between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. We found small nonsignificant genetic subdivision among eight populations from the northwest Atlantic (F ST = 0.002). All of these Atlantic populations were highly significantly differentiated from a northeast Pacific population (F ST = 0.087); all populations showed high inbreeding coefficients (F IS = 0.432). We tested one likely source of heterozygote deficits by aging individual clams and exploring genetic variation among age classes within populations (a temporal Wahlund effect). Populations showed strikingly different patterns of age structure, but we found little differentiation among age classes. In one case, we were able to analyze genetic diversity between age classes older or younger than the advent of intensive commercial harvesting. The results generally suggest spatially broad and temporally persistent genetic homogeneity of these bivalves. We discuss the implications of the results for the biology and management of surfclam populations. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Kinetic of Biomarker Responses in Juveniles of the Fish Sparus aurata Exposed to Contaminated Sediments},
abstract={Sediments in the National Park of the Atlantic Islands (Galicia, Spain) were affected by the spill of the tanker Prestige (November, 2002) and still present high levels of Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The adverse effects associated with the contaminants in sediments were tested using a chronic bioassay, exposing juveniles of the fish Sparus aurata (seabream). A toxicokinetic approach is proposed to evaluate sediment quality by linking chemical and ecotoxicological data along the time. Sediment samples were physicochemically characterized and the concentration of contaminants (Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons - PAHs - and metals) was measured. Fishes were exposed to contaminated sediments, and samples from different tissues were collected every 15<c2><a0>days throughout the 60<c2><a0>days that lasted the experiment. A biomarker of exposure (ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activity - EROD activity) and a biomarker of effect (histopathology) were analyzed during the exposure period. Results show a relationship between the biomarkers and the concentrations in sediments of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons--PAHs. Besides, the toxicokinetic approach links biomarkers response providing information about the relationship between the detoxification process and the damages observed in the different tissues. The frequency of the histological damage is highest when the EROD activity slightly decreases in accordance with the mechanism of detoxification of this enzymatic system against PAHs and other organic contaminants.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Active metabolism and swimming activity were used to study the effects of dodecyl benzene sodium sulfonate (LAS-C12) in Mugil platanus, a species traditionally considered as estuarine. The effects of exposure to different concentrations of LAS-C12 (0.0, 1.0, 2.5, and 5.0 mg/L) on the active metabolism and swimming activity of Mugil platanus were evaluated. The active metabolism and swimming activity were estimated through experiments conducted on each of 9 possible combinations of three temperatures (35, 20, and 15<c2><b0>C) and three salinities (35, 20, and 5[per thousand]). The results show that the active metabolism increases according to the LAS-C12 concentration in all temperatures and salinities studied. At the highest tested concentration (5.0 mg/L), the active metabolism was 111%; 84.8 and 105% higher than the control, at 35[per thousand] salinity at the three temperatures. However, the swimming activity decreased according to the LAS-C12 concentration in all temperatures and salinities studied. At the highest tested concentration, the swimming activity was 78.6, 73.6, and 78.7% less than the control, at 25<c2><b0>C at the three salinities. The active metabolism and swimming activity averages, achieved in the different salinities studied, were not significantly different, as a result of the LAS-C12 concentration.

title={The quick and the dead: larval mortality due to turbulent tidal transport},
abstract={Marine populations are typically connected over greater spatial scales than their terrestrial counterparts due to many species having a highly dispersive, planktonic larval phase. However, high levels of larval mortality in the plankton may reduce connectivity between populations. The effect of turbulence on larval mortality was investigated under natural conditions in a field experiment. Larvae were collected before and after being subjected to turbulent tidal flow from a marine reserve, with differential mortality being observed between taxa. Thin-shelled veligers of gastropods and bivalves showed significantly increased mortality, while barnacle nauplii and cyprids, bryozoan cyphonaute larvae and polychaete trochophores showed no effect of turbulent tidal transport. Where appropriate, marine reserve design should account for the reduced connectivity between populations associated with turbulent tidal transport between reserve and adjacent areas.

title={Patterns of microzooplankton growth in dilution experiments across a trophic gradient: Implications for herbivory studies},
abstract={To investigate the growth and grazing patterns of microzooplankton (MZP) in environments of differing productivity, dilution experiments measuring phytoplankton growth (mu) and grazing mortality (m) rates were performed using samples from contrasting locations along the Texas coast. Samples were collected from estuaries, coastal lagoons and offshore Gulf of Mexico locations in the spring and summer of 2001. MZP growth rates were determined in each dilution treatment. Although MZP biomass changed over time in most dilution treatments, adjusting mu and m for the actual grazer gradient (represented by geometric mean MZP biomass) did not cause a significant deviation from the nominal dilution gradient. Likewise, these adjustments did not yield significant regressions where none existed before adjustment. The dynamics of MZP taxonomic groups (ciliates, dinoflagellates) and size categories differed suggesting that in some cases internal predation may lead to trophic cascades. MZP biomass was higher in productive coastal waters and included a larger proportion of dinoflagellates than in the oligotrophic, ciliate-dominated waters of the Gulf of Mexico. The MZP biomass-to-chlorophyll a ratio was lowest in the hypereutrophic Nueces River, where MZP biomass significantly increased in all dilution treatments (net growth rates up to 2 day-1) suggesting a strong top-down control. In the brown-tide dominated Upper Laguna Madre and the oligotrophic seagrass-dominated Lower Laguna Madre MZP growth was decoupled from that of phytoplankton. At these sites, MZP were likely fueled by bacterial carbon and mixotrophy, respectively. Observing the growth response of MZP in dilution experiments can provide insight into trophic structure and efficiency of the microbial food web. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Ambient salinities drop dramatically during monsoon season in Hong Kong coastal waters, posing a number of problems for externally fertilizing species like the polychaete Hydroides elegans. In this study, we investigated (1) whether adults would retain their gametes when external salinity dropped to levels too low to support fertilization and development, and (2) whether failure of development at low salinity reflects a failure of fertilization or a failure of fertilized eggs to cleave. Adults released eggs and sperm in the laboratory even at the lowest salinity tested, a practical salinity (S) of 5, and yet very few eggs cleaved at salinities below about 22. By mixing gametes at high salinity and then transferring the fertilized eggs to low-salinity seawater, we found that salinities below about 22 reduced the percentage of fertilized eggs that cleaved. Similarly, mixing gametes at salinities as low as 15 and then transferring the eggs to full-strength seawater (S = 30) rescued a substantial number of eggs, many more of which cleaved after their transfer to the higher salinity. The results suggest that failure of early development at low salinity in this species in large part reflects an inability of newly fertilized eggs to complete meiosis and cleave, rather than simply a failure of fertilization.

This framework makes explicit the linkages between effects at lower levels of biological organization and higher-order ecological effects at the population, community, and ecosystem levels. The usefulness of this framework is illustrated by reference to specific examples from aquatic ecotoxicology.

abstract={Knowledge of the complex life cycle of Phaeocystis is a key to understanding its role in marine ecosystems and global biogeochemistry. An existing life cycle model was modified and used to integrate understanding of the Phaeocystis life cycle. In model-driven research, models expose gaps in our understanding, empirical studies ensue, and feedback improves understanding. Following this scheme, three facets of the life cycle model were examined here. With four exceptions, the empirical studies described have been presented in other literature citations. The first facet involved testing for the existence of a process or producing its description. These studies included: demonstration of in<c2><a0>vitro colony division in Phaeocystis pouchetii, description of in<c2><a0>vitro change in colony shape for P. pouchetii associated with senescence, determining which P. pouchetii life stage is vulnerable to viral infection and lysis, and an experiment designed to determine whether the sediment could be a source of new Phaeocystis colonies to overlying waters; results suggested that more-detailed investigation of benthic particles as a physical substrate for colony formation is warranted. The second facet involved investigation of process rate quantification or process control parameters. Process rate quantification included measurements of colony division rate and growth rate using mesocosm-derived colonies. Process control experiments included testing diatom frustule enhancement of P. pouchetii colony formation from solitary cells, and investigation of mesozooplanktonic suppression and microzooplanktonic enhancement of Phaeocystis globosa colony formation by planktonic grazer infochemicals. The third facet pertained to the molecular identification of genetic differences between single cells and colonies of P. globosa. These studies were designed to provide insight to the question of control factors involved in the transition between single cell and colonial life stages. The life cycle model provided a ready place to incorporate new insights and understanding from empirical studies into an existing model, and can be used to improve simulation models of the direct and indirect effects of Phaeocystis on global biogeochemistry.},

title={Fuzzy risk-based decision-making approach for selection of drinking water disinfectants},
abstract={The potential effects of disinfection by-products (DBP) on human health have become a serious concern over the last three decades. In addition to the chronic cancer risk, several acute effects such as cardiac anomalies, stillbirths, miscarriages, low birth weights and pre-term deliveries have also been reported as a result of exposure to the DBP. Although several disinfectants including chlorine, ozone, ultraviolet ray (UV) radiation, chloramine and chlorine dioxide are available to supply safe drinking water, comparative evaluations of these disinfectants and their application approaches for a particular source of water is rare. This may be due to the variability associated with predicting DBP formation, health effects from DBP exposure, cost and disinfection performance of various disinfectants used in public water supply systems; and/or the knowledge gap in the assessment and comparison of risks associated with specific disinfection strategies. In this study, a framework for comparative evaluation of disinfectants and their application approaches has been developed through incorporation of human health risk from DBP exposure, cost of disinfection process, technical feasibility and disinfection performance. A fuzzy synthetic evaluation technique has been incorporated where fuzzy triangular membership functions were developed to capture uncertainties of the basic attributes. This paper compared three disinfection approaches: chlorination, chloramination and granular activated carbon with post chlorination through a multi-stage hierarchy risk model in which the analytical hierarchy process has been used to determine the relative importance of various attributes at different hierarchy levels. Then the best disinfection approach has been outlined. This evaluation was found to be sensitive to the assignment of relative importance.},

abstract={Issue Title: Special Issue on Endocrine Disruption in Invertebrates As we enter the 21st "biocentury", with issues such as biodiversity and biotechnology growing in public profile, it is important to reflect on the immense ecological, medical and economic importance of invertebrates. Efforts to understand the diverse biology of invertebrates come from many directions, including Nobel Prize winning developmental biology, research to control insects that threaten human health and food supplies, aquaculture opportunities and also within ecotoxicology. In the latter context, this special journal volume highlights the importance of addressing endocrine disruption in aquatic invertebrates, from molecular and cellular biomarkers to population-relevant adverse effects. The contributors to this special volume have provided an excellent assessment of both the fundamental endocrinology and applied ecotoxicology of many aquatic invertebrate groups. On the premise that reproductive success is ultimately the vital population parameter, this chapter gives a personal view of key gaps in knowledge in invertebrate reproductive and developmental endocrinology and ecotoxicology. Based on current knowledge, there are four key issues that need to be prioritised within aquatic ecotoxicology: (1) a wider assessment of the reproductive status of invertebrates in both freshwater and coastal ecosystems; (2) prioritisation of laboratory studies in OECD and other regulatory test organisms, including basic endocrinology and ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) research; (3) development and validation of mechanistic biomarkers that can be used as "signposts" to help prioritise species and chronic test endpoint selection, and help link data from laboratory and field studies; and (4) develop a comparative invertebrate toxicology database utilising the prioritised reference chemicals from the EDIETA workshop, encompassing the diverse modes-of-action pertinent to endocrine disrupter testing in both aquatic arthropod and non-arthropod invertebrates.},

title={Mechanism of an epibiont burden: Crepidula fornicata increases byssus thread production by Mytilus edulis},
abstract={Epibionts of mussels can have detrimental effects on their basibionts, such as reduced growth rates, lower fecundity, increased mortality and an enhanced risk of dislodgement of the overgrown bivalves due to stronger hydrodynamic forces. In blue mussels Mytilus edulis, the epibiotic American slipper limpet Crepidula fornicata reduces growth and survival. In a field experiment we tested the hypothesis that an enhanced byssus thread production with high energetic costs for the mussels due slipper limpet epibionts is the underlying mechanism for the epibiont burden. Byssus thread production in overgrown mussels was twice as high as in unfouled M. edulis (11 <c2><b1> 0.9 and 5.4 <c2><b1> 0.6 byssus threads/mussel/day, respectively). A control experiment revealed intermediate byssus thread production (8.4 <c2><b1> 0.8 byssus threads/mussel/day) in mussels cleaned of C. fornicata at the beginning of the experiments, indicating that C. fornicata is responsible for the effects observed. We conclude that increased byssus production in fouled M. edulis is a functional response to higher drag caused by epibionts and that it is associated with increased energy expenditure that reduces allocation of resources for other processes such as growth, reproduction and survival. Such indirect effects of epibionts, mediated by an enhanced byssus production, may be widespread in byssus-producing bivalves, with important implications for their population dynamics.},

abstract={During their annual mid- to late-summer southward migration, Semipalmated Sandpipers (Calidris pusilla) feed intensively on the amphipod Corophium volutator on intertidal mudflats in the Bay of Fundy. Corophium, in turn, feed on diatoms and bacteria. Using a series of bird exclosures and fertilizer addition, we examined top<e2><80><93>down and bottom<e2><80><93>up effects, and investigated the presence of a trophic cascade in the mudflat community during the period when birds are abundant. Although both top<e2><80><93>down and bottom<e2><80><93>up forces were present in this system, neither transmitted beyond a single trophic link. Predation by shorebirds, which may be less size-selective than previously thought, reduced Corophium abundance in control plots by approximately 80% relative to exclosures, but most other species were unaffected. Shorebird predation did not result in an increase in diatom abundance, as predicted under the trophic cascade hypothesis. Fertilizer increased diatom abundance, but had no effect on Corophium abundance or bird predation, and little effect on other mudflat invertebrates. The only indirect effect observed was on mud snails (Ilyanassa obsoleta), which, by rapidly responding to changes in diatom abundance, compensated for both bird exclusion and fertilizer addition, and prevented the trophic cascade. This population response by snails, possibly stemming from competition with Corophium, probably contributed to the stability of the community. Our results provide an example of short-term compensation in a simple intertidal community, and highlight the importance of considering direct and indirect effects in community ecological studies. We conclude that while compensatory interactions that block trophic cascades may be more common in more complex ecosystems, they are not restricted to them.},

abstract={Trophic interactions within the plankton of the lowland River Meuse (Belgium) were measured in spring and summer 2001. Consumption of bacteria by protozoa was measured by monitoring the disappearance of 3H-thymidine-labelled bacteria. Metazooplankton bacterivory was assessed using 0.5-<c2><b5>m fluorescent microparticles (FMPs), and predation of metazooplankton on ciliates was measured using natural ciliate assemblages labelled with FMPs as tracer food. Grazing of metazooplankton on flagellates was determined through in situ incubations with manipulated metazooplankton densities. Protozooplankton bacterivory varied between 6.08 and 53.90 mg C m-3 day-1 (i.e. from 0.12 to 0.86 g C-1 bacteria g C-1 protozoa day-1). Metazooplankton, essentially rotifers, grazing on bacteria was negligible compared with grazing by protozoa (<e2><88><bc>1000 times lower). Predation of rotifers on heterotrophic flagellates (HFs) was generally low (on average 1.77 mg C m-3 day-1, i.e. 0.084 g C-1 flagellates g C-1 rotifers day-1), the higher contribution of HF in the diet of rotifers being observed when Keratella cochlearis was the dominant metazooplankter. Predation of rotifers on ciliates was low in spring samples (0.56 mg C m-3 day-1, i.e. 0.014 g C-1 ciliates g C-1 rotifers day-1) in contrast to measurements performed in July (8.72 mg C m-3 day-1, i.e. 0.242 g C-1 ciliates g C-1 rotifers day-1). The proportion of protozoa in the diet of rotifers was low compared with that of phytoplankton (<30% of total carbon ingestion) except when phytoplankton biomass decreased below the incipient limiting level (ILL) of the main metazooplantonic species. In such conditions, protozoa (mainly ciliates) constituted <e2><88><bc>50% of total rotifer diet. These results give evidence that microbial organisms play a significant role within the planktonic food web of a eutrophic lowland river, ciliates providing an alternative food for metazooplankton when phytoplankton becomes scarce.},

The method developed is fast processing and has the potential of identifying most species present in a plankton sample with low economic efforts. Those species for which partial 18S sequences are not yet available from GenBank, can be identified in families or at higher categories. The method was also tested on nine species and two subspecies of commercial importance in Italy to be carried out by the use of PCR-SSCP alone without sequencing.},

abstract={Species of Saccostrea are common oysters on Indo-Pacific rocky shores. The taxonomy of this genus is unclear, however, because of morphological plasticity among its constituent species. Oyster samples with distinct morphotypes were collected from shores experiencing different degrees of wave exposure in Japan, Taiwan, China, Vietnam, Singapore and Australia. Intraspecific and interspecific variations in shell characters have been identified. Only S. kegaki could be readily differentiated from S. cucullata-B, S. cucullata-C and S. mordax by multivariate shell allometric analyses. Phylogenetic analyses using partial mitochondrial 16S DNA sequences of approximately 513 base pairs identified two clades that correspond to superspecies, i.e. putative S. cucullata and putative S. mordax, comprising nine and two lineages from the Indo-West Pacific, respectively. These are S. cucullata-A, B, C, D, E, F, G, S. kegaki and S. glomerata in one clade, and S. mordax-A and B in the other. Interspecific sequence divergence (Kimura-2-parameter values) between lineages ranged from 1.02% to 11.74%. Both S. cucullata-C and S. kegaki are restricted to the northern hemisphere, whereas S. glomerata seems to be a temperate species from the southern hemisphere. S. cucullata-D occurs only in Taiwan. Other species, i.e. S. cucullata-A, B, D, E and F and S. mordax-A and B, have a wide range on rocky shores in the tropical and subtropical Western Pacific and in both northern and southern hemispheres.},

title={How parasitism and pollution affect the physiological homeostasis of aquatic hosts},
abstract={Abstract Parasitism poses a serious threat to hosts under certain circumstances, while the well-being of organisms is also negatively affected by environmental pollution. Little information is available on the simultaneous effects of parasites and pollutants on the physiological homeostasis of organisms. The present paper demonstrates that parasites: (i) may influence the metabolism of pollutants in infected hosts, (ii) interact with pollution in synergistic or antagonistic ways, and (iii) may induce physiological reactions in hosts which were thought to be pollutant-induced. Experimental studies on the uptake and accumulation of metals by fish reveal that fish infected with acanthocephalans have lower metal levels than uninfected hosts; e.g. Pomphorhynchus laevis reduces lead levels in fish bile, thereby diminishing or impeding the hepatic intestinal cycling of lead, which may reduce the quantity of metals available for fish. Alterations in pollutant uptake and accumulation in different intermediate and final hosts due to parasites are thus very important in the field of ecotoxicology. In addition to such alterations, there is a close interaction between the effects of pollutants and parasites which seems to be mediated at least partly by the endocrine system, which itself is closely related to the immune system in fish. Laboratory studies on eels experimentally infected with the swimbladder nematode Anguillicola crassus reveal that toxic chemicals such as polychlorinated biphenyls produce immunosuppressive effects which facilitate parasite infection. Similarly, an increase in serum cortisol concentration in eels due to chemical exposure and infection is correlated with decreasing levels of anti-A. crassus antibodies. Furthermore, parasites are able to elicit physiological changes which are attributed to chemicals with endocrine disrupting activity, e.g. the cestode Ligula intestinalis is known to suppress gonad development in roach. The most thoroughly documented examples of endocrine disruption in wild fish are in roach, and it is conceivable that this disruption is not only due to chemical activity but also to parasites such as L. intestinalis or species of the phylum Microspora.

title={Pollutant-induced effects on immunological and physiological interactions in aquatic host-trematode systems: implications for parasite transmission},
abstract={Abstract Under conditions of pollution both host and parasite are susceptible to the pathogenic effects of toxicants, which in turn may result in detrimental changes to their immunological and physiological processes. Digenetic trematodes, which encompass species of both medical and economic importance, possess complex life cycles and are common parasites of both vertebrates and molluscs. The combined stress induced by pollution and parasitism influences the physiology of the host which can have implications not only on host survival but also on the functional biology of resident parasite populations. The present paper reviews the effects of pollutants on the immunology and physiology in both vertebrate and molluscan host-trematode systems and the implications for parasite transmission.

abstract={Madrynomya bruneti n. gen. and sp. is an undescribed bivalve collected from the late Miocene Puerto Madryn Formation in northern Patagonia. The specimens were collected together with other generally well-preserved mollusks from a parauthochtonous assemblage within a fine-grained sandstone. Based on their unique shell morphology, the specimens are placed in the Modiomorphoidea, a group of bivalves known only from the Paleozoic and Mesozoic. This conclusion is based on comparisons with other bivalve taxa such as Mytiloida, Dreissenidae, Modiomorphidae, Hippopodidae, and Anomalodesmata, which they resemble in different morphological features. However, careful inspection of key characters suggests that none of them are closely allied to this new genus, and placement in the Modiomorphidae is only tentative until more material is found and further characters, such as shell microstructure, can be properly analyzed. Likewise, an accurate reconstruction of this bivalve's life habit is presently impossible to determine with the two available specimens, but an endobyssate mode is probable, as has been inferred for Myoconcha.

abstract={Most engineering systems are subject to a wide range of possible uncertain future conditions. The probabilistic reliability analysis usually fails to address the problems of human error, subjectivity, and lack of system performance history and records. This paper explores the utility of the following fuzzy performance measures for evaluating the performance of a complex water supply system: (i) combined reliability-vulnerability, (ii) robustness, and (iii) resiliency. The regional water supply system for the City of London, Ontario, Canada, is used as the case study. The computational requirements for the implementation of the fuzzy performance measures and their sensitivity to different shapes of fuzzy membership functions are investigated. The study illustrates the capability of the fuzzy performance measures to handle uncertainty and identify critical system components. This can be of value in identifying the optimal level of improvement that will increase the overall system performance. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={The effect of cadmium on antioxidant responses and the susceptibility to oxidative stress in the hydrothermal vent mussel Bathymodiolus azoricus},
abstract={Hydrothermal vents are a unique environment of extreme physical-chemical characteristics and biological species composition. Cd is a toxic non-essential metal present in high concentrations in the hydrothermal vent environment, contrary to those found in marine coastal areas. Cd toxicity has been related, among other things, with reactive oxygen species production, even though this is a non-redox metal. Bathymodiolus azoricus is a deep-sea Mytilid bivalve very common in the Mid Atlantic Ridge (MAR) hydrothermal vent fields and very little is known about the antioxidant defence system in this specie. Because lethal Cd concentration in B. azoricus is unknown, the aim of this study was to assess the effects of a Cd concentration higher than that found in the hydrothermal vents on oxidative stress biomarkers, such as antioxidant enzymes. Mussels were exposed to 100 microg l-1 Cd during 24, 48 and 144 h, respectively, in a pressurized aquarium (IPOCAMP). Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidases (GPx), total oxyradical scavenging capacity (TOSC), metallothionein (MT) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) were measured in the gills and mantle of B. azoricus. The results indicate that gills are first affected by Cd toxicity. This may be due to different physiological functions of the tissues and by the presence of thio and methanotrophic symbiotic bacteria in the gills. The SOD and CAT are inhibited during the first day of exposure in the gills, although TOSC and MT concentrations were the same in control and exposed mussels. In the mantle, enzymatic activation only occurred after 6 days, and no significant differences in MT concentrations were found in the control and exposed mussels during the first day, as observed in the gills.

abstract={Runoff of leachate from East Lake and Dare County Construction and Demolition Debris landfills has the potential to impact wildlife resources at Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge, Dare and Hyde Counties, North Carolina. Sediment quality of samples collected in August 2000 at 14 locations down-gradient from the landfills was assessed by measuring metal and organic contaminants in the sediments, chronic toxicity of solid-phase sediment (28-d static-renewal exposures; survival and growth as test endpoints) and acute toxicity of sediment porewater (96-h static exposures) to Hyalella azteca (Crustacea: Amphipoda). In addition, contaminant bioaccumulation from 4 sediments was determined using 28-d exposures of Lumbriculus variegatus (freshwater oligochaete). Although survival was not impaired, length of H. azteca was significantly reduced in sediments from 5 locations. Pore water from 4 locations was acutely toxic to H. azteca. Metals and a few polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were bioaccumulated by L. variegatus from the sediments. Several metals and PAHs exceeded sediment quality guidelines, and metals in porewater from several sites exceeded water quality criteria for the protection of aquatic wildlife. Runoff of leachate from the landfills has reduced sediment quality and has the potential to adversely affect wildlife resources at Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

This assay involves the simultaneous use of a pair of general universally targeted 18S rRNA gene primers, five specific 18S rRNA gene targeted oligonucleotide primers internal (nested) to the universal primer pair and one species-specific primer that is not nested (Mya). The specificity of each primer was evaluated in silico, empirically, and verified further by sequencing of amplification products from single larvae collected from plankton samples. Identification of individually isolated bivalve larvae from plankton samples was based on the size of the PCR product produced by the specific primers after visualisation by agarose gel electrophoresis. Preliminary studies indicated that this method was suitable for use with freshly collected and preserved larvae, and is therefore suitable for field application. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Abstract The platinum group metals (PGM) Pt, Pd and Rh are emitted into the environment mainly by catalytic exhaust gas converters of cars. As PGM accumulate in sediments of aquatic ecosystems, the study was focused on the uptake of the noble metals by European eels, Anguilla anguilla infected with the acanthocephalan Paratenuisentis ambiguus. Eels were exposed to ground catalytic converter material for six weeks. After exposure Pt and Pd were detected in the liver and kidney of the eels and in the parasites. Palladium was also found in fish muscle and intestine. No Rh uptake by the eel tissues and the parasites occurred. Paratenuisentis ambiguus contained the highest levels of both metals with 40 times higher Pt concentrations and four times higher Pd concentrations than the liver of its host. Due to its accumulation capacity for PGM, P. ambiguus can be applied as a sensitive accumulation indicator in field studies to assess the degree of environmental PGM contamination in aquatic ecosystems.

title={Lake Erie ecosystem change: Phytoplankton communities},
abstract={The biological, chemical, and physical factors that govern large lake phytoplankton abundance and dynamics are complicated by the socioeconomic demands of humans in the watershed. Lake Erie exemplifies a large lake where human-influenced land use changes and perturbations in the watershed directly affect lake function. The degradation of the Laurentian Great Lakes in the 1960's, as evidenced by phytoplankton blooms in Lake Erie among other problems, caused a public outcry that led to the passage of the binational Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement of 1978. By the mid-1980's, reduction of excess nutrient load decreased phytoplankton community biomass 68% from 1970 values. With the invasion of exotic dreissenid mussels, phytoplankton community biomass was expected to decrease even further due to the mussels' high filtering capacity (up to one liter per individual per day). We used a multi-agency (The Ohio State University; Division of Wildlife, Ohio Dept. of Natural Resources; National Water Research Institute, Environment Canada) supported study of Lake Erie plankton abundance from 1996 through 2003 to examine recent changes in the lake-wide phytoplankton community biomass and found that total phytoplankton biomass has increased over 100% from the lows of the mid-1980's. Potentially toxic cyanobacteria biomass has increased even more (>500%), whereas other taxa more edible to zooplankton (Chlorophyta, Cryptophyta) have increased by 60 to 250%. We conclude that Lake Erie is becoming more eutrophic even though management strategies continue to limit nutrient loading to levels found in the 1980's. We propose three hypotheses for recent changes: (1) unmonitored nutrients are entering the lake; (2) dreissenid mussels' excretion modified within-lake nutrient cycling; and/or (3) tributary phytoplankton populations significantly contribute to lake-wide phytoplankton blooms.},

Here we present a synopsis on current and innovative techniques which can be used to monitor the ambient concentration and fate of algal toxins in grazers and determine their eventual target within the grazers' tissues. We focus on a newly recognized class of oxylipin toxins (volatile polyunsaturated aldehydes and oxo-acids), which have been identified from lipid-rich microalgae. While some workers have reported that these biotoxins have negative effects on fecundity and recruitment of metazoan grazers, this mechanism is currently under debate as a result of conflicting evidence. We argue that the use of a variety of non-standard and often invalid or unrealistic assays has confounded our ability to scrutinize this mechanism systematically.},

In another programme, influent - effluent monitoring for 11 pharmaceuticals and specific hormones showed high removal rates, except for sulphamethizol and furosemide. High removal is probably due to WWTP operation with long SRTs. Effluent biomonitoring of freshwater mussels showed only bioaccumulation for: diethyl-phthalate, LAS, EOX as well as Cr and Ni.

abstract={Argopecten purpuratus was exposed to two different diets which reflected short term variations in quantity and quality of the natural food supply typical in bays of southern Chile. No significant differences of clearance rate were observed over different time periods at either of two food concentrations. The scallop reduced its clearance rate significantly when it was exposed to the higher food concentration. Pseudofaeces production occurred only at this high diet and the time factor had no significant effect on this process. The organic content of pseudofaeces was significantly lower than the organic content of the food, suggesting a pre-ingestive selection mechanism. Based on this capacity for particle selection, A. purpuratus was able to compensate for the differences in food quality of the experimental diets and ingesting particulate material containing 38% organic matter as a result of the selection process when fed at the higher food concentration. Absorption efficiency was lower following exposure to the high food concentration, suggesting that the experimental time of 72 h was not sufficient to acclimate the digestive response to a food supply significantly different from that of its habitat of origin. Phytoplankton form the principal nutritional source for this epibenthic species, and resuspended detritus, although occurring in large quantities, may only be of importance once digestive processes become acclimated to processing them.

title={Removal of geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol by biological filtration},
abstract={The quality of drinking water is sometimes diminished by the presence of certain compounds that can impart particular tastes or odours. One of the most common and problematic types of taste and odour is the earthy/musty odour produced by geosmin (trans-1, 10-dimethyl-trans-9-decalol) and MIB (2-methylisoborneol). Taste and odour treatment processes including powdered activated carbon, and oxidation using chlorine, chloramines, potassium permanganate, and sometimes even ozone are largely ineffective for reducing these compounds to below their odour threshold concentration levels. Ozonation followed by biological filtration, however, has the potential to provide effective treatment. Ozone provides partial removal of geosmin and MIB but also creates other compounds more amenable to biodegradation and potentially undesirable biological instability. Subsequent biofiltration can remove residual geosmin and MIB in addition to removing these other biodegradable compounds. Bench scale experiments were conducted using two parallel filter columns containing fresh and exhausted granular activated carbon (GAC) media and sand. Source water consisted of dechlorinated tap water to which geosmin and MIB were added, as well as, a cocktail of easily biodegradable organic matter (i.e. typical ozonation by-products) in order to simulate water that had been subjected to ozonation prior to filtration. Using fresh GAC, total removals of geosmin ranged from 76 to 100% and total MIB removals ranged from 47% to 100%. The exhausted GAC initially removed less geosmin and MIB but removals increased over time. Overall the results of these experiments are encouraging for the use of biofiltration following ozonation as a means of geosmin and MIB removal. These results provide important information with respect to the role biofilters play during their startup phase in the reduction of these particular compounds. In addition, the results demonstrate the potential biofilters have in responding to transient geosmin and MIB episodes.},

abstract={Increased interest in using ecologically inert clays to flocculate, sediment, and thus mitigate harmful algal blooms at nearshore mariculture sites has prompted studies on the effectiveness of this method on prolific blooms, such as those caused by the neurotoxic dinoflagellate Karenia brevis in the Gulf of Mexico. Potential repercussions of this control strategy revolve around the increased flux of suspended particles to the benthos. Juvenile suspension-feeding bivalves are potentially vulnerable as they could suffer burial, a decrease in clearance rates, and/or an increase in pseudofeces production in response to suspended clay, leading to reduced growth and delay in attaining size refuge from predators. Here we assess lethal and sublethal effects on juvenile hard clams, Mercenaria mercenaria, in a 2-week flume application of phosphatic clay to simulated blooms of the nontoxic dinoflagellates Heterocapsa triquetra and Prorocentrum micans. Flow regimes simulated two contrasting, worst-case field conditions where (1) low flow allowed complete sedimentation and formation of a benthic sediment layer, and (2) high flow allowed complete particle suspension. No clam mortalities occurred in either treatment. The sedimentation treatment showed variable growth inhibition in shell and/or tissue, but effects were not apparent compared to controls (no sediment layer), and clams rapidly resumed siphon contact with the overlying water column. In contrast, a strong growth effect (~90% reduction in shell and tissue growth) occurred in particle-suspension trials compared to no-clay controls. These results suggest that repeated clay applications in the field are likely more detrimental to clams in a high-energy environment leading to prolonged in situ resuspension of clay than in an environment favoring sedimentation.

A numerical example is presented. The results indicate that such modal shifts should be avoided, since the more the cargo is shifted from the marine mode to other modes, the more unfavourable the consequences are for the system.

abstract={We measured within- and among-population genetic variation in the green sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis) at 11 sites in the north Atlantic and northeast Pacific by using four-locus microsatellite genotypes. We found no differentiation among populations from Atlantic Canada, but strong differentiation across the north Atlantic and between the Atlantic and Pacific samples. High inbreeding coefficients at three loci are consistent with high variance in reproductive success. One population that was recently decimated by disease was strongly differentiated from some others, but there was little differentiation otherwise among populations in Atlantic Canada. On a larger scale, populations in Atlantic Canada were more similar to a population from the north Pacific than to populations in the northwest Atlantic. Differentiation among populations at this large spatial scale is consistent with biogeographical hypotheses of: (1) Pleistocene population reduction and isolation in the northeast Atlantic, but (2) extinction in the northwest Atlantic followed by extensive recolonization from the Pacific. In contrast to other recent studies of trans-Atlantic organisms, we found no evidence of extensive gene flow across the north Atlantic. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={The role of coarse colloids as a carrier phase for trace metals in riverine systems},
abstract={In order to better understand the role of colloids in aquatic systems, better fractionation methods of environmental samples into particulate, colloidal, and truly dissolved phase are needed. An adequate fractionation procedure involves 1) prefiltration to remove large (i.e., settling) particles and 2) ultrafiltration to separate colloids from the truly dissolved compounds. Prefiltration is most commonly accomplished using filters with 0.45 or 0.22 <ce><bc>m pore size, which results in the inclusion of coarse colloids (size by definition up to about 1 <ce><bc>m) into the particulate phase. To evaluate the possible drawbacks of such operational procedures, the trace metal fraction associated with coarse colloids (size range 0.45-1.2 <ce><bc>m) was quantified in a number of rivers having different biogeochemical characteristics and degree of anthropogenic impact. Al, Pb, and Ti showed a strong association with coarse colloids (often over 50% of the total filterable metal at 1.2 <ce><bc>m) in all rivers. Other elements (Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, U, V, and Zn) had a more variable behaviour, possibly linked to differences in conductivity, oxygen saturation, and nature of colloids (mineral, organic, or mixed) among rivers. No overall statistically significant relationships could be found between the percentage metal fractions associated with coarse colloids and master environmental variables. However, when systems where classified according to the nature of colloids, Al and Pb showed statistically significant relationships with suspended particulate matter. Significant relationships were also observed between the metal pairs Mn/Co, Mn/Cu, Mn/V, Fe/Co, and Fe/Ni. The association of trace metals with coarse colloids has important implications as to their transport, fate and bioavailability in natural systems. These findings suggest that, at least in some cases, the use of the classical size limit of 0.45 <ce><bc>m as a boundary between the particulate and dissolved phases should be partially reconsidered and redefined.

Feeding rates, including clearance rate, filtration, ingestion and absorption, and absorption efficiency were higher in summer and autumn and lower in winter. Pseudofaeces were produced but the preferential selection of organic materials by P. viridis was not concluded. Scope for growth in July and October were higher than in February. Activities of digestive enzymes including amylase and cellulase in the digestive diverticula and crystalline style were high in May and July and lower in February and October and correlated with f. Faster growth rates obtained for P. viridis in Hong Kong's summer are considered a result of enhanced feeding and absorption at high temperatures and f values. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={In this study, triploid Sydney rock oysters Saccostrea glomerata, which do not reproduce and have only limited gonadal development, were used to calculate the cost of producing and maintaining somatic tissues. The consumption of oxygen was measured and converted to units of energy expended. The consumption of oxygen of diploid oysters, in different stages of the reproductive cycle, was also measured. Knowing the costs of producing and maintaining somatic tissues (obtained from the triploid oysters), it was possible to calculate the energy demand of somatic and reproductive tissues of diploid oysters. The focus of this study was to test whether this method would work, to investigate if this method would give results in accordance with modern life-history theory and to test hypotheses about costs of reproduction in oysters. It was found that in diploid oysters, 27% of the consumed oxygen was needed for reproductive processes. It was also found that the costs of production and maintenance of reproductive tissues were on average 84% of those of somatic tissues. Costs for the production and maintenance of somatic tissues decreased over time. Costs for reproduction also decreased, but were dependent on the stage of gonadal development. If the relative mass of gametes in the gonads was large, the costs were relatively small; if the mass was relatively small, the costs were large. Differences between traits of males and females were never significant, suggesting that reproductive effort and costs were similar in males and females. It was estimated that if diploid oysters did not reproduce, they could gain 64% more somatic ash-free dry mass. Thus, in terms of growth, reproduction is an expensive activity.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Temperature adaptation in eurythermal cod (Gadus morhua): A comparison of mitochondrial enzyme capacities in boreal and Arctic populations},
abstract={Activities of citrate synthase (CS), cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) and the electron transport system (ETS) were investigated in white muscle and liver of laboratory-maintained cod, Gadus morhua, from the North Sea, Norwegian coast and Barents Sea for an analysis of temperature acclimation and adaptation in aerobic metabolism. Cold acclimation within each population led to elevated activities of CS, CCO and ETS in white muscle. In liver, however, only North Sea cod showed cold-compensated CS activities, with CCO and ETS unchanged. In contrast, cold-acclimated Norwegian cod displayed unchanged enzyme activities, and Arctic cod showed elevated activities for CS, but decreased activities for CCO and no change in ETS. Between-population comparisons revealed clear evidence for permanent cold adaptation in white muscle of northern (Norwegian coast and Barents Sea) compared to boreal (North Sea) cod populations, reflected by higher activities of CS, CCO and ETS at the same acclimation temperature. Cold-compensated, mass-specific enzyme activities in liver were found in northern compared to boreal cod for CS and CCO, however, for ETS, after warm acclimation only. When evaluated as capacity in total liver, such activities were only found in northern populations in the case of CS at all temperatures, and for CCO and ETS at 15 degrees C only. Hepatosomatic index (IH) and liver lipid contents were highest in North Sea cod, with similar IH but lower lipid contents in cold- versus warm-acclimated animals. An acclimation effect on IH was found in Norwegian cod only, with higher IH but unchanged lipid contents in the cold. In conclusion, permanent cold adaptation of muscle aerobic metabolism prevails in cod populations at higher latitudes, which is in line with permanently elevated rates of oxygen consumption observed in a parallel study. These differences reflect higher maintenance costs in cold-adapted versus cold-acclimated cod. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={Branchial musculature of a venerid clam: Pharmacology, distribution, and innervation},
abstract={This study was meant to analyze the neural control of the branchial muscles of the clam Mercenaria mercenaria. Gills isolated from the animal contract in response to 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT), dopamine (DA), and acetylcholine (ACh); but the ACh contraction occurred only if the gills had been pretreated with the cholinesterase inhibitor eserine. The 5HT antagonists cyproheptadine and mianserin blocked the contractile effects of all of the agonists. However, gills exposed to the 5HT antagonists and eserine relaxed in response to ACh. The DA antagonist SCH-83566 inhibited the effects of DA, but had no effect on contractions induced by 5HT and ACh. The ACh antagonist hexamethonium inhibited both the excitatory and inhibitory effects of ACh, but had no effect on contractions induced by 5HT and DA. 5HT and DA in gill tissue were visualized by immunohistochemistry. Within each gill filament are dorsoventral neurons running adjacent to the epithelium and containing immunoreactive 5HT and DA. A complex network of of 5HT-positive fibers is associated with the septa, blood vessels, and muscles, whereas DA-positive fibers are restricted to the septa. We propose that 5HT is the excitatory transmitter to the gill muscles, and that DA and ACh exert their excitatory effects by stimulating 5HT motor nerves. ACh may also be an inhibitory transmitter of the muscles.},

abstract={The advent of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based DNA markers, which claim to identify species diagnostically in the Mytilus edulis complex (M. edulis, M. galloprovincialis and M. trossulus) presents a possible method for simple, rapid species identification of Mytilus larvae. This study examines the inheritance of the Me 15/16 nuclear-DNA locus, which has previously been shown to produce three alleles diagnostic for M. edulis, M. galloprovincialis and M. trossulus. The Me 15/16 genotype was determined for pure species and hybrid larvae from 13 laboratory crosses between these three species and for adult mussels from five natural populations from which the parents of the crosses were selected. Genotype frequencies in the parent populations were generally as expected for M. edulis and M. galloprovincialis, but M. trossulus populations from eastern Canada and the Baltic Sea gave unexpected results. The marker was readily detected in individual larvae sampled 72 h and 2 weeks after fertilization, but amplification from 3 h old larvae was less reliable. Each cross produced larvae of all the expected genotypes and the results demonstrate that each of the three alleles can be inherited from either sex. The marker appears to be inherited in a Mendelian manner and should be of potential use in the future study of larvae in the M. edulis complex.},

title={Ontogenetic changes in gill morphology and potential significance for food acquisition in the scallop Placopecten magellanicus},
abstract={Sources of mortality in both wild and cultured populations of marine bivalves during postlarval stages remain largely unknown, but may be partly associated with the inability to meet energetic demands during intense morphogenesis. The development of the gills in postsettlement scallops (Placopecten magellanicus) from 0.35 to 14 mm in shell height (SH) was investigated using scanning electron microscopy to determine the degree of size-specific differentiation of the gills and evaluate potential ontogenetic constraints in food acquisition. Key transitional stages in morphogenesis, likely to exert pronounced effects on feeding function, were identified and correlated with scallop size. The gill was initially homorhabdic, with unreflected inner demibranchs forming a basket-like structure maintained by ciliary junctions. Gill reflection, immediately followed by accelerated proliferation of gill filaments and formation of outer demibranchs, occurred at ~1 mm SH. Outer demibranchs were fully formed at ~2 mm SH. Suspension-feeding is probably rather inefficient prior to attaining 1-2 mm sizes. The onset of the heterorhabdic, adult form of the gill, which allows bidirectional particle transport and the potential for selection and for volume regulation of ingested material on the gill, occurred fairly late in development, at ~3.3-5.0 mm SH. Full development of gill plication was delayed until scallops attained ~7 mm. Gill differentiation in this species is thus relatively protracted and punctuated by critical transitional stages, which may be important in determining feeding and growth capacity of postlarval wild and cultured populations.

abstract={Abstract A data set on intestinal helminth parasites was collected in the course of an 18 year investigation into the biology of eels in Meelick Bay, Lough Derg, River Shannon. This was used to test two hypotheses relating to the composition and structure of intestinal helminth communities, namely that eels in large rivers do not harbour richer and more diverse communities than those in small rivers but that community composition and structure are more stable over time than in small rivers. The helminth community was species poor, with only six species comprising the component community and a maximum infracommunity richness of three species. The community was overwhelmingly dominated by the acanthocephalan Acanthocephalus lucii, reflecting the importance of its intermediate host Asellus aquaticus in the eels' diet. The remaining helminth species contributed to species richness but made very little contribution to community diversity. Population levels of Acanthocephalus lucii fell and remained low between 1992 and 2000, probably reflecting increased movement of eels from other parts of the lough into Meelick Bay. Diversity values were low, but similar to those reported from other rivers in Britain and Europe. The results provided support for both hypotheses and indicated that in respect of richness, diversity and dominance, the helminth communities of eels in the River Shannon were typical of, and comparable to, those of other large rivers throughout Europe.

title={Photosynthetic carbon allocation: Effects of planktivorous fish and nutrient enrichment},
abstract={The proportions of lipid, polysaccharide and protein profoundly influence the nutritional value of food for planktonic organisms. Here, we investigated the effects of nutrients (N and P) and planktivorous fish (Phoxinus sp.) on the partitioning of photosynthetically fixed ^sup 14^C-labelled bicarbonate into macromolecules (lipids, polysaccharides and proteins) and low molecular weight (LMW) metabolites of epilimnetic phytoplankton living in large (8 m diameter) enclosures from July to mid-October 1991. The enclosures were situated in an oligotrophic lake (north of Montreal, Canada) in both shallow (3.5 m) and deep (11 m) locations. The fractions were calculated using the sequential extraction of ^sup 14^C-labeled phytoplankton samples incubated for short duration (2 hours) at maximum photosynthetic rates. Labelling patterns of all end products exhibited great temporal variations. Overall, the LMW, polysaccharide, lipid and protein fractions accounted for 32.1 <c2><b1> 10.5%, 31.0 <c2><b1> 8.8%, 19.2 <c2><b1> 5.3% and 17.8 <c2><b1> 6.1% of the total ^sup 14^C fixed respectively. Percent ^sup 14^C in the LMW fraction was, in general, lower in the nutrient-enriched enclosure and was usually lower in the deep than the shallow enclosures. The effect of fish on the labelling pattern of LMW varied throughout the sampling period but, overall, its impact was non-significant. The proportions of ^sup 14^C into lipids and polysaccharides did not show the expected increase under nutrient deficiency. In contrast, the polysaccharide fraction increased, for the most part, with nutrient enrichment and was higher in the deep than the shallow enclosures with little changes in the presence of planktivorous fish. Incorporation of ^sup 14^C into lipids remained relatively uniform throughout the study and averaged less than 20% of total fixed carbon. Nutrient addition increased the lipid fraction in early July but did not have a significant effect thereafter. In general, the presence of planktivorous fish decreased the lipid fraction especially in the deep N + F enclosures. With nutrient enrichment, the proportion of ^sup 14^C incorporated into protein decreased in the shallow enclosures while it increased in the deep enclosures. During most of the study, there was no significant effect of fish on the distribution pattern of protein. Percent carbon protein averaged 20% of total carbon fixed during the summer and decreased to 10% in October with lower water temperatures. Any fish effects encountered throughout this study were probably mediated indirectly through changes in the species and cell size compositions of phytoplankton. An experiment where samples were incubated with depth (0.5 to 7 m) showed that, for all treatments, the protein fraction increased with depth at the expense of lipid and LMW metabolites syntheses. The polysaccharide fraction demonstrated no apparent relationships with depth. These changes with depth most likely reflect light attenuation rather than a decrease in temperature. Overall, our findings would suggest that the distribution patterns of photosynthetically incorporated carbon into LMW compounds and macromolecules in natural phytoplankton communities are controlled by a combination of both abiotic (e.g., nutrients, light and temperature) and biotic (species and cell size) environmental factors and the interactions between these factors will in essence influence the direction of carbon flow and the food quality of the phytoplankton. These observations are placed in context with a review of the literature on carbon allocation by natural populations of phytoplankton. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={The freshwater snail Physa fontinalis was used as a bioindicator to study the effects of the herbicide Paraquat (PQ) in laboratory assays. The test solutions used, 0.125, 0.25, and 0.5 mg/l PQ, were in the range of the concentrations recommended for aquatic weed control. The study was carried out in two stages to determine the influence of PQ on the ovipository activity of Physa fontinalis, and the histological effects on these snails. Specimens exposed to PQ continued to be reproductively active, but the number of egg masses and eggs laid decreased significantly. Mortality was almost the same in all the experimental lots, but was significantly related to the production of egg masses only in the controls. The histological analysis showed a clear trend among PQ concentrations and degenerating oocytes, but no visible effects on the male sex-line were observed. By interfering with fertility, PQ has an action that may go well beyond its lethal effect on individuals, suggesting that this herbicide should be strictly regulated in weed control programmes. Moreover, since PQ was observed to interfere with the reproductive process, its endocrine disrupting action must not be excluded.},

title={Mechanistic studies on baseline toxicity and uncoupling of organic compounds as a basis for modeling effective membrane concentrations in aquatic organisms},
abstract={Mechanistic studies on membrane toxicity are reviewed and linked to effects observed in-vivo. Time-resolved spectroscopy on energy-transducing membranes is an in-vitro test method that provides information on the toxicodynamics of membrane toxicity, namely baseline toxicity and uncoupling. Without blurring effects of the toxicokinetic phase, the intrinsic potency of membrane toxicants can directly be determined thus allowing the development of a classification system to distinguish between baseline toxicity and uncoupling. Toxicity data of known baseline toxicants and of substituted phenols from literature are reevaluated in light of the information obtained from the mechanistic test system. Exposure-based effect data (aqueous effect concentrations) of substituted phenols (baseline toxicants and uncouplers) from various aquatic organisms (bacteria, protozoa, algae, daphnids, fish) are compared to the corresponding effect concentrations expected from baseline toxicity. The results of the comparison support the view that the membrane is the primary target site for acute toxicity of substituted phenols in aquatic organisms. The classification into baseline toxicants and uncouplers based upon the criteria derived from the mechanistic test system is correct. Nevertheless, the acute toxicity in-vivo cannot be correlated quantitatively to the mechanistic data presumably because bioaccumulation is not directly proportional to intrinsic toxicity and the metabolic transformation is variable within the test set of substituted phenols. The pH-dependence of acute toxicity is mainly determined by the pH-dependence of bioccumulation, the internal effect concentrations are virtually independent on external pH. The internal effect concentrations, also called lethal body burdens or critical body residues, which are taken from the literature or calculated from aqueous effect concentrations and bioconcentration factors, are related to membrane concentrations using a simple three-compartment equilibrium partitioning model. The modeled membrane concentrations of non-polar and polar narcotics turn out to be statistically indistinguishable, which is consistent with the findings from the mechanistic test system. The toxic ratios, i.e., the excess toxicity of uncouplers in relation to their baseline toxicity, agree for most compounds upon comparison of the mechanistic test system with the aquatic organisms thus confirming that uncoupling is the dominant mode of action responsible for lethality.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Excessive nutrient loads in rivers and lakes have adverse effects on ecosystem functioning and human activities. The International Rhine Committee has tried to reverse this trend by formulating emission reduction objectives. One of the human activities that may benefit from this is water production that uses surface water as its main source. This paper explores whether reductions in nutrient loads in the Rhine basin result in changes in (the intensity of) treatment activities by the water treatment plant of the Water-transport-company Rhine-Kennemerland (WRK) at Andijk, the Netherlands. For this purpose, a regression analysis was performed on data from 1990-1995 to find a quantitative relationship between the water quality objective for the end product on the one hand, and water quality parameters in Lake IJssel and various treatment processes on the other hand. In the years 1985-1995, phosphorus loads to Lake IJssel reduced by 50% as a result of significant abatement efforts in the Rhine river basin. As a result, chlorophyll-a concentrations decreased by less than 10%. Further phosphorus emission reductions in the Rhine river basin, for example 75% by the year 2000 as is the objective in the Rhine Action Programme, are expected to result in a 30% decrease in chlorophyll-a concentrations compared with the levels of 1985. These reductions in chlorophyll-a concentrations can be expected to have some impacts on the water treatment plant of WRK at Andijk. However, as they constitute less than 1% of production costs, the monetary benefits of these reductions are limited.},

The dissolved Cu or Zn concentrations measured after equilibrating soil samples with a 0.01 M solution of CaCl<2< showed that the metal concentrations found in soils with combined metal additions were not significantly different from those with single metal additions. After an exposure period of six months, many nematode community parameters and individual nematode taxa were significantly affected by increasing concentrations of Cu and Zn up to 200 mg kg<-1<. Some nematode taxa, such as <Thonus<, <Alaimus< and <Aporcelaimellus< were very sensitive and disappeared at Cu and Zn concentrations exceeding 50 mg kg<-1<. For several nematode community parameters and nematode taxa, EC<50< values for single metal exposures were used to calculate TU<50< values for the joint toxicity of Cu and Zn. Based on these calculations, it is concluded that the effects of a combined exposure to Cu and Zn were additive or less than additive. Before this conclusion can be generalised, however, more data are needed on other types of soil, other pH values and other combinations of pollutants.},

Bacterial abundance cellular carbon content and productivity were significantly higher at the more eutrophic coastal site (P <0.01). Bacterivorous rotifers usually dominated total rotiferan abundance at both sites. All cladocerans except Leptodora kindtii grazed bacteria, but most copepods did not. Microzooplankton (especially rotifers) were generally more important bacterial grazers than macroplankton (primarily cladocerans) at both sites, and accounted for 56 and 71% of total zooplankton bacterivory at the coastal and offshore sites, respectively. However, on four occasions (out of 16 cases) when cladoceran biomass was >60% of total zooplankton biomass, macrozooplankton bacterivory accounted for 54-95% of total bacterivory. Total zooplankton generally consumed <50% of bacterial productivity at the coastal site, while zooplankton bacterivory often exceeded bacterial productivity at the offshore site. Zooplankton consumed an average of 27 and 114% daily bacterial standing stock at the coastal and offshore site respectively. Considering the total community bacterivory zooplankton were often more important bacterial predators than protists. Our results demonstrate the importance of bacteria as a carbon source for zooplankton in the Lake Erie food web, where rotifers can contribute significantly to total zooplankton bacterivory.},

title={Results of an International Plankton Investigation on the River Rhine},
abstract={Quantitative plankton observations have been carried out in the River Rhine from Lake Constance to the North Sea as part of an ecological monitoring programme, initiated to provide a baseline for evaluating measures taken under the â€œRhine Action Programmeâ€. The phyto- and Zooplankton monitoring, carried out in 1990 is the first concerted programme covering the 1000 km long reach of the river below Lake Constance. Seasonal observations at 20 fixed stations along the river were carried out by different institutes; this required calibration of methods. In the upper Rhine the sparse population of phyto-plankton (< 5 Âµg chlorophyll-a l-1) was dominated by various groups of algae, i.e. Cryptop-hyceae, Bacillariophyceae, Chlorophyceae and Cyanophyceae. Downstream, the phyto-plankton density increased gradually, while Bacillariophyceae tended to dominate. The high densities found in the lower R. Rhine represented only a few species of centric Bacillariophyceae and Chlorophyceae. The dense blooms of phytoplankton in the lower R. Rhine are triggered by the input of phytoplankton from the upper reaches and tributaries, and are stimulated by large inputs of nutrients. These blooms are accompanied by blooms of Zooplankton, especially rotifers, Dreissena polymorpha larvae and, in the lower Rhine, nauplii larvae. The species composition and biomass of plankton in the R. Rhine vary strongly during the year but also between years, as indicated for the period 1980-1990. However, the information at the species level needs further elaboration to allow interpretation of long-term trends. Notably, the input by tributaries should be included. To assess these long-term trends we recommend supplementing the large-scale biological inventory, as planned for the years 1995 and 2000, with plankton observations in the years between and investigating the relationship between the benthic and pelagic communities of the river.},

abstract={The St. Lawrence River, at Cornwall Ontario, has accumulated sediment contaminants, mainly mercury (Hg) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), from industrial point sources over many years. Although those sources are past, the river at Cornwall remains an Area of Concern (AOC). Because of remediation and other changes in the AOC, improved knowledge of contaminants in wild-fish and their putative links to health effects could help decision makers to better assess the AOC<e2><80><99>s state. Thus, we compared tissue concentrations of Hg, PCBs, morphometric measures of health, and biomarkers of exposure, metabolic-, and reproductive health in native brown bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus) from the AOC to those of upstream reference fish. Linear discriminant analysis separated the adult fish of both sexes among upstream and downstream sites without misclassification. Burdens of total-Hg (all sites) and PCB toxic equivalents (downstream sites) exceeded the guidance for the protection of wildlife consumers. There were subtle effects of site on physiological variables, particularly in female fish. Total-Hg in tissue correlated negatively to plasma testosterone and 17<ce><b2>-estradiol in female fish at Cornwall: moreover, concentrations of both hormones were lower within the AOC compared to reference site fish. A similar effect on vitellogenin, which was uncorrelated to E2/T at the downstream sites, indicated the potential for reproductive effects. Downstream fish also had altered thyroidal status (T3, TSH, and ratio of thyroid epithelial cell area to colloid area). Despite spatial and temporal variability of the endocrine-related responses, these subtle effects on fish health within the AOC warrant further study.},

These compounds with other estrogenic chemicals may be responsible for disrupting effects observed in fish. A total of 100 juvenile carp were treated experimentally with 17<c3><9f>-estradiol (E2), and increasing doses of 4-NP, BPA and also mixture of them. Then the plasma Vtg levels were measured using indirect competitive ELISA. Results showed a significant (P<0.05) increase in Vtg levels of exposed carps with E2, maximum 4-NP, BPA and their mixture. The group treated with E2 showed high induction (490%) with respect to controls. The groups treated with maximum dose of 4-NP and BPA showed also induction of Vtg, whereas the group treated with their mixture (3 mg kg-1 b.w. 4-NP and 0.01 mg kg-1 b.w. BPA) showed the highest induction (2126%). Finally, results showed that mixture of 4-NP and BPA exhibited stronger (synergistic) effects. So that, large scale monitoring of estrogenic effects caused by contamination may be considered as a biomarker in urban and industrial effluents.},

abstract={This paper focuses on heavy metal distribution patterns in sediments of central Guilan (CG) and east Mazandaran (EM) in the south Caspian Sea coasts, north of Iran. Sediment sub-samples were retrieved from core and surficial samples in different environments of marine and coastal lagoons as well as coastal outcrops. Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry and Atomic Emission Spectrometry (ICP-MS and ICP-AES) analysis were used to determine the metal chemistry. Concentration of the selected heavy metals exhibited variations through sediment samples which are partially related to grain size and organic matter content. Geoaccumulation index and statistical procedures have been implemented for analyzing the absolute metal values. Result of the geoaccumulation index demonstrated that the metal distribution reflects the influence of geological background of the watershed area. Some elements including Pb, Ni, Cu, Sr and Ba showed elevated concentration in the CG that could be attributed to development of industrial activities. A comparison of the metal concentration in the marine sediments and the Late Holocene outcrops revealed that the level of the metals concentration at the sea generally corresponds to natural background. The northern part of Iranian multi-lithological catchments basin is the main source for the sediments that drained by the rivers to the South Caspian Sea basin.},

Results showed a temporal stable but high spatial heterogeneity landscape pattern during 2005<e2><80><93>2013. According to the regional ecosystem health index, it experienced a rapid decline after a slight increase, and finally it maintained at an ordinary level. Among these areas, a significant distinction was presented in different towns. It indicates that the ecosystem health of Tianjijiedao town, the regional administrative centre, descended rapidly during the study period, and turned into the worst level in the study area. While the Hetuan Town, located in the northwestern suburb area of Panji District, stayed on a relatively better level than other towns. The impacts of coal mining collapse area, land reclamation on the landscape pattern and ecosystem health status of mining cities were also discussed. As a result of underground coal mining, land subsidence has become an inevitable problem in the study area. In addition, the coal mining subsidence area has brought about the destruction of the farmland, construction land and water bodies, which causing the change of the regional landscape pattern and making the evaluation of ecosystem health in mining area more difficult. Therefore, this study provided an ecosystem health approach for relevant departments to make scientific decisions.},

title={The phosphorus cycle in the Sanggou Bay},
abstract={The phosphorus cycle is studied during 2013-2014 in the Sanggou Bay (SGB), which is a typical aquaculture area in northern China. The forms of measured phosphorus include dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP), dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP), particulate inorganic phosphorus (PIP), and particulate organic phosphorus (POP). DIP and PIP are the major forms of total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) and total particulate phosphorus (TPP), representing 51%-75% and 53%-80%, respectively. The concentrations and distributions of phosphorus forms vary among seasons relative to aquaculture cycles, fluvial input, and hydrodynamic conditions. In autumn the concentration of DIP is significantly higher than in other seasons (P<0.01), and higher concentrations are found in the west of the bay. In winter and spring the phosphorus concentrations are higher in the east of the bay than in the west. In summer, the distributions of phosphorus forms are uniform. A preliminary phosphorus budget is developed, and shows that SGB is a net sink of phosphorus. A total of 1.80<c3><97>10 7 mol/a phosphorus is transported into the bay. The Yellow Sea is the major source of net input of phosphorus (61%), followed by submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) (27%), river input (11%), and atmospheric deposition (1%). The main phosphorus sink is the harvest of seaweeds (Saccharina japonica and Gracilaria lemaneiformis), bivalves (Chlamys farreri), and oysters (Crassostrea gigas), accounting for a total of 1.12<c3><97>10 7 mol/a. Burial of phosphorus in sediment is another important sink, accounting for 7.00<c3><97>106 mol/a. Biodeposition by bivalves is the major source of phosphorus in sediment, accounting for 54% of the total.},

title={The effects of copper pyrithione, an antifouling agent, on developing zebrafish embryos},
abstract={A substitute for the organotins has been the use of metal pyrithiones, principally zinc and copper (CuPT) as antifouling agents. Zebrafish, Danio rerio, embryos were exposed after fertilization to increasing concentrations of CuPT (2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 32 and 64 [mu]g/L) for 24 h. Morphological abnormalities at 30, 96 and 120 hours post fertilization (hpf) were recorded. Abnormalities at concentrations of 12 [mu]g/L and higher were observed. Notochords became severely twisted as concentrations increased. These distortions of the notochord originated in the tail at the lower concentrations and proceeded rostrally with increasing dose. Edema was observed in the cardiac and yolk sac regions at the 12 and 16 [mu]g/L CuPT concentrations. Light microscopy showed disorganization of muscle fibers, disruption and distortion of the transverse myoseptum and vacuolization of the myocyte. Hatching was measured every 12 h for 5 days following the 24 h exposure. Hatching decreased in a dose dependent manner. At 120 hpf, 47 % of the 64 [mu]g/L CuPT treated embryos hatched. Inductively coupled plasma atomic absorbance spectrophotometry (ICPAAS) revealed copper bioaccumulation in whole embryo tissue and was significantly elevated in 32 and 64 [mu]g/L CuPT treatment groups as compared to controls. Lipid peroxidation end products were significantly increased in animals exposed to 32 and 64 [mu]g/L of CuPT. These data demonstrate that oxidative stress may play a role in the toxicity. The abnormalities and deformities observed in fish larvae would significantly decrease survival in polluted aqua-systems and question the use of this product as an antifouling agent.},

Fifty target pharmaceuticals and perfluorinated chemicals in groundwater were mostly present at ng L^sup -1^ concentrations, except for 17[alpha]-ethynylestradiol, sulfamethoxazole, and acetaminophen (maximums of 1822, 1820, and 1036 ng L^sup -1^, respectively). Perfluorinated compounds were detected with the highest frequencies in groundwater at almost all of the sample sites, especially short-chained perfluorinated carboxylates, which were easily transferred to the groundwater. The results indicate that the compounds found to have high detection frequencies and concentrations in groundwater are similar to those found in other countries around the world. Most common pharmaceuticals that contain hydrophilic groups, such as sulfonamide antibiotics and caffeine, are easily transported through surface waters to groundwater. The results also indicated that the persistent natures of emerging contaminants with high detection frequencies in surface water and groundwater, such as perfluorooctanesulfonate (risk quotient >1), caffeine, and carbamazepine, should be further studied and evaluated.},

title={Can single empirical algorithms accurately predict inland shallow water quality status from high resolution, multi-sensor, multi-temporal satellite data?},
abstract={Assessing and monitoring water quality status through timely, cost effective and accurate manner is of fundamental importance for numerous environmental management and policy making purposes. Therefore, there is a current need for validated methodologies which can effectively exploit, in an unsupervised way, the enormous amount of earth observation imaging datasets from various high-resolution satellite multispectral sensors. To this end, many research efforts are based on building concrete relationships and empirical algorithms from concurrent satellite and in-situ data collection campaigns. We have experimented with Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 multi-temporal satellite data, coupled with hyperspectral data from a field spectroradiometer and in-situ ground truth data with several physico-chemical and other key monitoring indicators. All available datasets, covering a 4 years period, in our case study Lake Karla in Greece, were processed and fused under a quantitative evaluation framework. The performed comprehensive analysis posed certain questions regarding the applicability of single empirical models across multi-temporal, multi-sensor datasets towards the accurate prediction of key water quality indicators for shallow inland systems. Single linear regression models didn't establish concrete relations across multi-temporal, multi-sensor observations. Moreover, the shallower parts of the inland system followed, in accordance with the literature, different regression patterns. Landsat 7 and 8 resulted in quite promising results indicating that from the recreation of the lake and onward consistent per-sensor, per-depth prediction models can be successfully established. The highest rates were for chl-a (r<sup>2</sup>=89.80%), dissolved oxygen (r<sup>2</sup>=88.53%), conductivity (r<sup>2</sup>=88.18%), ammonium (r<sup>2</sup>=87.2%) and pH (r<sup>2</sup>=86.35%), while the total phosphorus (r<sup>2</sup>=70.55%) and nitrates (r<sup>2</sup>=55.50%) resulted in lower correlation rates.},

abstract={The toxic potential of four disinfectant agents (chlorine, ozone, peracetic acid and UV radiation), used in the disinfection of urban wastewater, was evaluated with respect to four aquatic organisms. Disinfection assays were carried out with wastewater from the city of Araraquara (S<c3><a3>o Paulo State, Brazil), and subsequently, toxicity bioassays were applied in order to verify possible adverse effects to the cladocerans (Ceriodaphnia silvestrii and Daphnia similis), midge larvae Chironomus xanthus and fish (Danio rerio). Under the experimental conditions tested, all the disinfectants were capable of producing harmful effects on the test organisms, except for C. xanthus. The toxicity of the effluent to C. silvestrii was observed to increase significantly as a result of disinfection using 2.5 mg L^sup -1^ chlorine and 29.9 mg L^sup -1^ ozone. Ozonation and chlorination significantly affected the survival of D. similis and D. rerio, causing mortality of 60 to 100 % in comparison to the non-disinfected effluent. In experiments with effluent treated with peracetic acid (PAA) and UV radiation, a statistically significant decrease in survival was only detected for D. rerio. This investigation suggested that the study of the ideal concentrations of disinfectants is a research need for ecologically safe options for the treatment of wastewater.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

In July and August, anoxic samples from depths >6 m were collected to examine the presence of an active anaerobic CO metabolism. The surface [CO] decreased from 65 to 5 nmol kg^sup -1^ from spring to summer, which was attributed to a decline in dissolved organic matter. Diel [CO] showed a strong mid-afternoon maximum with a late evening and early morning minimum.

abstract={Changes in total lipids and fatty acid profiles (FAPs) of gonad, digestive gland, mantle and muscle of the tropical scallop Nodipecten nodosus were examined during coastal upwelling and upwelling relaxation periods. Total lipids were most abundant in digestive gland, and intermediate in female gonad. Multidimensional scaling analysis of similarities (MDS-ANOSIM) and similarity percentage analyses (SIMPER) revealed significant changes of FAPs of the four tissues during the upwelling and upwelling relaxation periods. During both periods, SIMPER analysis revealed an internal similarity index greater than 90% for FAP of each tissue. However, during upwelling the gonad-FAP showed a lower dissimilarity index with the digestive gland-FAP (10), than with muscle-FAP (11) or mantle-FAP (13). In general, during upwelling, the fatty acids 16:0, 18:0, 16:1 n-7, 20:5n-3, 22:6n-3 and total PUFAn-3 explained 42 to 63% of variance between tissues; during upwelling relaxation, these fatty acids together with 14:0 and 18:1 n-7, explained 46 to 64% of variance. During upwelling period, MDS-ANOSIM showed a close association between FAP of digestive gland and gonad, suggesting a rapid transfer of fatty acids between these tissues, and consequently, that N. nodosus follows an opportunistic strategy during this period. In contrast, during upwelling relaxation, the slow and continuous fall in total lipid contents of digestive gland (September to November) and the progressive reduction of MDS distances between FAPs of digestive gland and gonad (August until November), suggest a gradual transfer of lipids from digestive gland to gonad to support the gonad development observed during this period. This suggests that N. nodosus switches to a conservative strategy during the upwelling relaxation period. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={The present study was conducted to evaluate the safety of long-term dietary curcumin at doses 0.5 and 1 % in Anabas testudineus employing hematological and cytological techniques. The fish were fed with curcumin-supplemented feed for 6 months. Fine blood smears were prepared and subjected to three different staining techniques. The erythrocyte micronucleus frequency (MN) and the cytometric measurements of erythrocytes were determined. Blood from the control and treated fish was subjected to the assessment of several hematological parameters. Also, DNA fragmentation assay on hepatocytes was conducted. The results showed that hemoglobin content, RBC count and hematocrit increased in the curcumin-fed fish compared to control, whereas WBC count, platelet count, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration were unaffected. WBC/RBC ratio was lower in the case of curcumin-treated fish. The cytometric measurements revealed no change in the erythrocytes and their nuclei after curcumin treatment. DNA fragmentation assay revealed intact DNA in curcumin-fed group, ruling out the possibility of curcumin-induced DNA damage. The positive control group showed a significant increase in MN frequency compared to negative control and curcumin-fed groups. In fact, the MN frequency decreased in 1 % curcumin-fed group compared to the negative control and 0.5 % curcumin groups. All these indicated a state of well-being of the curcumin-treated fish. Therefore, it is concluded that curcumin could be used as a safe feed ingredient to improve the growth of finfish in aquaculture.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

The study was conducted to evaluate the genotoxic potential of polluted water of river Gomti in two fish species, namely Channa punctatus and Mystus vittatus. The fishes were exposed in situ in nylon cages to the polluted water of river Gomti fixed near a distillery outlet located in Lucknow.

The comparison of DNA damage between the two species indicated that C. punctatus is more sensitive to aquatic pollutants. Thus, this fish could be used as a bio-indicator of genotoxicity for bio-monitoring of water bodies. The results further revealed that the river Gomti is being contaminated with potential genotoxic and mutagenic chemicals produced from industrial and domestic activities; therefore, immediate measures are needed to reduce the inflow of pollutants in the river.},

abstract={Long-term metal exposure risk assessment for aquatic organism is a challenge because the chronic toxicity of chemical is not only determined by the amount of accumulated chemical but also affected by the ability of biological regulation or detoxification of biota. We quantified the arsenic (As) detoxification ability of tilapia and developed a biologically based growth toxicity modeling algorithm by integrating the process of detoxification and active regulations (i.e., the balance between accumulated dose, tissue damage and recovery, and the extent of induced toxic effect) for a life span ecological risk prediction. Results showed that detoxification rate (k ^sub dex^) increased with increasing of waterborne As when the accumulated metal exceeded the internal threshold level of 19.1<c2><a0><ce><bc>g<c2><a0>g^sup -1^. The k ^sub dex^ values were comparable to or even higher than the rates of physiological loss and growth dilution in higher exposure conditions. Model predictions obtained from the proposed growth toxicity model were consistent with the measured growth data. The growth toxicity model was also used to illustrate the health condition and growth trajectories of tilapia from birth to natural death under different exposure scenarios. Results showed that temporal trends of health rates and growth trajectories of exposed fish in different treatments decreased with increasing time and waterborne As, revealing concentration-specific patterns. We suggested that the detoxification rate is critical and should be involved in the risk assessments framework. Our proposed modeling algorithm well characterizes the internal regulation activities and biological response of tilapia under long-term metal stresses. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

In order to assess the potential role of macroinvertebrates in VHSV transmission, Diporeia spp., a group of amphipods that are preyed upon by a number of susceptible Great Lakes fishes, were collected from seven locations in four of the Great Lakes and analyzed for the presence of VHSV. It was demonstrated that VHSV is present in some Diporeia spp. samples collected from lakes Ontario, Huron, and Michigan, but not from Lake Superior. Phylogenetic comparison of partial nucleoprotein (N) gene sequences (737 base pairs) of the five isolates to sequences of 13 other VHSV strains showed the clustering of Diporeia spp. isolates with the VHSV genotype IVb. This study reports the first incidence of a fish-pathogenic rhabdovirus being isolated from Diporeia , or any other crustacean and underscores the role macroinvertebrates may play in VHSV ecology.},

abstract={This paper illustrates the results of an analysis performed on historical data of the main meteorological and water quality variables collected during the last fifty years in the basin of Lake Trasimeno, a shallow lake subjected to important water level fluctuations. The results reveal a significant increase of the annual mean of minimum and maximum air temperature, water temperature and solar radiation, and a significant reduction of precipitation and cloud cover, which have mostly occurred during the last twenty years. The decadal rate of warming observed in the last twenty years for air temperature (0.33 <c2><b0>C decade-1) is consistent with the estimate reported by the IPCC for the land-surface temperature in the Northern Hemisphere, whereas the surface water temperature in Lake Trasimeno shows a more marked increase (0.65 <c2><b0>C decade-1), comparable to that observed in other lakes of Mediterranean areas. On a monthly scale, the most significant variations are observed in late-spring and early summer months for temperature and solar irradiation, and in winter and spring months for rainfall, which result in an appreciable modification of the seasonal progression. The alterations of the thermal and hydrological balance of the lake have caused a progressive lowering of the water level and the emergence of evaporative conditions. As a consequence of the drought, a progressive accumulation of dissolved salts (3.5 106 kg y-1) is observed, which is partially explained by meteoric loading. The analysis also shows that an increase in the total alkalinity has occurred during the main drought phases of the last forty years, which has been shown to be consistent with what expected on the basis of the changes in the ionic composition of the waters. With decreasing water levels, a strong reduction in water transparency has also been observed, which does not appear to be connected with a change in the trophic state of the lake, but rather with the increase of suspended solids from bottom sediments, in agreement with the predictions based on resuspension models in shallow waters. On putting the results into the future scenario of climate change, an accelerating drought and progressive worsening of the water quality can be predicted for Lake Trasimeno in the near future.},

While the largest concentrations of nodularin have been measured from the benthic organisms and the food web originating from them, the concentrations in the pelagic organisms are not negligible. The observations on concentrations in zooplankton and planktivorous fish are sporadic, however. A field study in the Gulf of Finland, northern Baltic Sea, was conducted during cyanobacterial bloom season where zooplankton (copepod Eurytemora affinis, cladoceran Pleopsis polyphemoides) and fish (herring, sprat, three-spined stickleback) samples for toxin analyses were collected from the same sampling areas, concurrently with phytoplankton community samples. N. spumigena was most abundant in the eastern Gulf of Finland. In this same sampling area, cladoceran P. polyphemoides contained more nodularin than in the other areas, suggesting that this species has a low capacity to avoid cyanobacterial exposure when the abundance of cyanobacterial filaments is high. In copepod E. affinis nodularin concentrations were high in all of the sampling areas, irrespective of the N. spumigena cell numbers. Furthermore, nodularin concentrations in herring samples were highest in the eastern Gulf of Finland. Three-spined stickleback contained the highest concentrations of nodularin of all the three fish species included in this study, probably because it prefers upper water layers where also the risk of nodularin accumulation in zooplankton is the highest. No linear relationship was found between N. spumigena abundance and nodularin concentration in zooplankton and fish, but in the eastern area where the most dense surface-floating bloom was observed, the nodularin concentrations in zooplankton were high. The maximum concentrations in zooplankton and fish samples in this study were higher than measured before, suggesting that the temporal variation of nodularin concentrations in pelagic communities can be large, and vary from negligible to potentially harmful.

This work is the first study to research the embryology and larval development of this species of razor clam, using light and scanning electron microscopy. A new method, consisting of changing water levels using tide simulations with brief dry periods, was developed to induce spawning in this species.

title={The Modulating Role of Dissolved Organic Matter on Spatial Patterns of Microbial Metabolism in Lake Erie Sediments},
abstract={To evaluate the role of dissolved organic matter (DOM) on microbial community metabolism, we established extracellular enzyme activity (EEA) and substrate-induced respiration (SIR) profiles of sediment samples collected from littoral and profundal regions of the western, central, and eastern basins of Lake Erie. Lake Erie is spatially structured such that the central and western basins receive relatively major inputs of allochthonous DOM in comparison to the eastern basin. Overall, spatial patterns of EEA and SIR profiles suggest both greater metabolic diversity and activity in the littoral regions of the central and western basins. In contrast, the eastern basin demonstrated much less structuring between littoral and profundal areas. To evaluate whether the observed spatial patterns are the result of microbial community adaptations to local DOM availability, we performed three experimental treatments by inoculating sediment samples with polyvinylpyrrolidone, which sequesters large polyphenols, or with either vanillin or catechol, two small phenolic compounds. Our results revealed that esterase and glycosidase EEA from the eastern basin were induced by small phenolics and inhibited by large polyphenols. In contrast, the addition of small phenolics decreased esterase and glycosidase activities from the central basin, while polyphenols had a negligible effect. These results suggest that the source and composition of DOM play a significant role in the local adaptation of microbial communities, determining large-scale spatial patterns of microbial functional diversity in Lake Erie sediments.},

title={Zooplankton response to extreme drought in a large subtropical lake},
abstract={Plankton data from 1997 to 2005 were used to examine impacts of a managed draw-down, subsequent drought and resulting historic low water levels (during 2000 and 2001) on the zooplankton of Lake Okeechobee, Florida. Prior to the drought the lake supported less than 150 ha of submerged vegetation. Following the drought, over 15,000 ha of submerged vegetation developed around the lake shore and conditions favored greater survival of age 0 fish. The zooplankton changed significantly from the pre- to post-drought period, including: (a) a near-complete loss of all dominant species of cladocerans and rotifers; and (b) an abrupt transition to a community with over 80% of total biomass comprised of Arctodiaptomus dorsalis, a calanoid copepod previously described as being resistant to fish predation. These changes persisted over a 5 year post-drought sampling period. In contrast, there were no systematic changes in biomass of bacteria, phytoplankton, inedible cyanobacteria, algal cell size, suspended solids, or any other physical or chemical attributes known to affect zooplankton in shallow lakes. Evidence points towards increased predation by fish, and perhaps invertebrates, as factors responsible for loss of cladocerans and rotifers following the drought, and indicates a need for future research to link changes in water level to shifts in predation pressure in this and other shallow lakes.},

abstract={The parautochthonous Anisian and Ladinian rocks of the New Pass Range previously referred to as the Augusta Mountain Formation have a unique, endemic assemblage of pteriomorphian bivalves with Triassic Northern Hemisphere biogeographic relationships, especially to the Carnian cratonal faunas of northeastern British Columbia as well as to Ladinian faunas of the Shoshone Mountains and the Gillis Range. A new suborder Prospondyloidina is described, as well as three new genera, Promysidiella, Loxochlamys, and Nevadapecten, a new subgenus, Gervillaria (Baryvellia), and 17 new species either named or referred to by letters: Promysidiella planirecta, P. desatoyensis, Bositra favretensis, Enteropleura species a, Gervillaria (Baryvellia) ponderosa, Atrina sinuata, Antiquilima ladinica, Palaeolima newpassensis, Plagiostoma acutum, Leptochondria shoshonensis, Asoella? species a, b, and c, Oxytoma (Oxytoma) grantsvillensis, Pleuronectites newelli, Loxochlamys corallina, and Nevadapecten lynnae. Promysidiella aff. otiosa is a new combination for Mytilus otiosus McLearn; Mysidiella newtonae n. sp., Norian, Wallowa terrane, is based on Krumbeckiella cf. timorensis (Krumbeck) of Newton, 1987. Triassic "Posidonia" is placed in Bositra de Gregorio, 1886, regarded as a senior synonym of Peribositria Kurushin and Trushchelev, 1989. The morphological and stratigraphic sequence Bositra-Enteropleura-Daonella-Aparimella-Halobia is rooted in Paleozoic Caneyella and Posidonia and indicates declining dependence on and eventual loss of byssal attachment as well as a possible shift from low to high dispersal ability (between Bositra and Enteropleura). There is no evidence for trans-Panthalassan dispersal of bivalves in low latitudes within the interval of Ladinian coral beds. So-called Tethyan and Muschelkalk species are endemics in slowly evolving genera or are phylogenetically convergent on west Tethyan species. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

title={On the growth of bivalve gills initiated from a lobule-producing budding zone},
abstract={The growth of bivalve gills proceeds at the posterior end of the gill from a meristem-like budding zone, that is, an undifferentiated terminal organ, which continuously proliferates new gill elements in growing bivalves. In representatives of protobranch, filibranch, and eulamellibranch gills (13 species from Protobranchia, Pteriomorphia, Palaeoheterodonta, and Heterodonta), the first growth steps demonstrate a uniform basic pattern. The budding zone produces either transverse folds that split after a transition zone into parallel pairs of lobules (which themselves later differentiate into the inner and outer demibranchs), or it produces the lobules directly, without first forming a transition zone. The lobules elongate, differentiate into lobes, and transform into leaflet-like structures (protobranchs) or into filaments (filibranchs and eulamellibranchs). The filaments represent the differentiated outer margins of each lobe, of which the central tissue (interlamellar septum) becomes incised or fenestrated, or transformed by tissue junctions. A distally located main growth zone for each lobe is suggested. With regard to the delayed onset of the differentiation of the outer demibranch in juvenile unionids, an additional temporary growth zone for filaments is suggested to exist at the anterior end of the outer demibranch.

title={Predicting suitable habitat for dreissenid mussel invasion in Texas based on climatic and lake physical characteristics},
abstract={Eurasian zebra and quagga mussels were likely introduced to the Laurentian Great Lakes via ballast water release in the 1980s, and their range has since expanded across the US, including some of their southernmost occurrences in Texas. Their spread into the state has resulted in a need to revise previous delimitations of suitable dreissenid habitat. We therefore assessed invasion risk in Texas by 1) predicting distribution of suitable habitat of zebra and quagga mussels using Maxent species distribution models based upon global occurrence and climate data; and 2) refining lake-specific predictions via collection and analysis of physicochemical data. Maxent models predicted a lack of suitable habitat for quagga mussels within Texas. However, models did predict the presence of suitable zebra mussel habitat, with hotspots of suitable habitat occurring along the Red and Sabine Rivers of north and east Texas, as well as patches of suitable habitat in central Texas between the Colorado and Brazos Rivers and extending inland along the Gulf Coast. Although predicted suitable habitat extended further west than in previous models. most of the Texas panhandle, west Texas extending toward El Paso, and the Rio Grande valley were predicted to provide poor zebra mussel habitat suitability. Collection of physicochemical data (i.e., dissolved oxygen, pH, specific conductance, and temperature on-site as well as laboratory analysis for Ca, N, and P) from zebra mussel-invaded lakes and a subset of uninvaded but high-risk lakes of North and Central Texas, did not refine model predictions because there was no apparent distinction between invaded and uninvaded lakes. Overall, we demonstrated that while quagga mussels do not appear to represent an invasive threat in Texas, abundant suitable habitat for continuing zebra mussel invasion exists within the state. The threat of continued expansion of this poster-child for negative invasive species impacts warrants further prevention efforts, management, and research.},

title={Non-native habitat as home for non-native species: comparison of communities associated with invasive tubeworm and native oyster reefs},
abstract={Introduction vectors for marine non-native species, such as oyster culture and boat fouling, often select for organisms dependent on hard substrates during some or all life stages. In soft-sediment estuaries, hard substrate is a limited resource, which can increase with the introduction of hard habitat-creating non-native species. Positive interactions between non-native, habitat-creating species and non-native species utilizing such habitats could be a mechanism for enhanced invasion success. Most previous studies on aquatic invasive habitat-creating species have demonstrated positive responses in associated communities, but few have directly addressed responses of other non-native species. We explored the association of native and non-native species with invasive habitat-creating species by comparing communities associated with non-native, reef-building tubeworms Ficopomatus enigmaticus and native oysters Ostrea conchaphila in Elkhorn Slough, a central California estuary. Non-native habitat supported greater densities of associated organisms-primarily highly abundant non-native amphipods (e.g. Monocorophium insidiosum, Melita nitida), tanaid (Sinelebus sp.), and tube-dwelling polychaetes (Polydora spp.). Detritivores were the most common trophic group, making up disproportionately more of the community associated with F. enigmaticus than was the case in the O. conchaphila community. Analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) showed that native species' community structure varied significantly among sites, but not between biogenic habitats. In contrast, non-natives varied with biogenic habitat type, but not with site. Thus, reefs of the invasive tubeworm F. enigmaticus interact positively with other non-native species.},

title={Distribution models of invasive plants over-estimate potential impact},
abstract={Habitat suitability models developed for non-native, invasive species often implicitly assume that projected invasion risk equates to risk of impact. I aim to test to what extent this assumption is true by comparing commonly-used invasive plant distribution datasets to abundance records. I compared herbarium occurrence records (downloaded from an online database) and regional occurrence records (compiled from individual states) to abundance estimates collected from over 300 invasive plant experts for 9 invasive species in the western U.S. I also created habitat suitability models (HSMs) using these datasets and compared the areas of predicted suitability. Sixty percent of the time, herbarium occurrences were located in regions where the species was rare enough to be undetected by experts, while only 26 \% coincided with locations identified as having high abundance. Regional occurrences were located in areas where the species was not detected 32 \% of the time, and on high abundance 42 \% of the time. HSMs based on herbarium records encompassed 89 \% of land area at risk of abundance, but overestimated the area of estimated risk (27-46 \% false positive rate). HSMs based on regional occurrences had a smaller false positive rate (22-31 \%), but encompassed only 67-68 \% of area suitable for abundance. Herbarium records are strongly skewed towards locations with low invasive plant abundance, leading to invasion risk models that vastly overestimate abundance risk. Models based on occurrence points should be interpreted as risk of establishment only, not risk of abundance or impact. If HSMs aim to be more management relevant, invasion risk models should include abundance as well as occurrence.},

Distance to boat ramps was the most important predictor of zebra mussel establishment, accounting for 27\% of variation in occurrence. Probability of occurrence was highest within 3 km upstream of boat ramps, probably due to boating activity and the impounded waters typically associated with boat ramps. Our results highlight the need for implementing stringent control measures around boat ramps, and demonstrate the value of spatially modelling species distribution to create risk maps for targeting monitoring efforts at those locations most vulnerable to invasion.},

abstract={Invasive zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) pose both a significant economic and environmental threat to aquatic systems yet there are currently no effective methods for achieving large-scale eradication. As a result, predicting and preventing their spread play a critical role in management efforts. Zebra mussels were first found in Texas in 2009 and, as of November 2019, have invaded 39 lakes across five river basins. Prior state-specific risk-assessments have been solely based on habitat suitability and have not considered dispersal potential. We developed a water body specific, constrained gravity model incorporating habitat suitability and dispersal potential to predict potential future invasion patterns. We examined the relative importance of habitat suitability, lake attractiveness, the relative risk of different boater types, and the impact of boater compliance with recommended prevention measures. Differences in lake attractiveness resulted in different boater dispersal patterns but the impact on projected lake invasions were reduced by variation in habitat suitability. The model projected zebra mussels to be mainly limited by habitat conditions in east Texas and by dispersal in west Texas. Most lakes in central Texas were projected to become invaded in the near future unless boater compliance with preventive management was high.},

The widespread establishment of highly efficient filter-feeding, non-native Daphnia in New Zealand lakes may have led to competition for algae with kakahi. We conducted a controlled laboratory experiment to determine whether differences exist in algal resources utilised by kakahi and North American Daphnia pulex. Echyridella menziesii (adults and juveniles) and D. pulex were exposed to mixed algal samples for three hours to determine whether similar algal resources were removed by the grazers. Relative to controls, both adult and juvenile E. menziesii removed a broad range of algal taxa including diatoms, green algae and filamentous species, ranging in size from 33.6 to 348.0 mu m. High densities of D. pulex were unable to cause depletion of these same algae species. Our results suggest niche overlap is limited between the two grazers; E. menziesii utilises larger particles than D. pulex.},

abstract={AimMapping the geographic distribution of non-native aquatic species is a critically important precursor to understanding the anthropogenic and environmental factors that drive freshwater biological invasions. Such efforts are often limited to local scales and/or to single species, due to the challenges of data acquisition at larger scales. Here, we map the distribution of non-native freshwater species richness across the continental United States and investigate the role of human activity in driving macroscale patterns of aquatic invasion. LocationThe continental United States. MethodsWe assembled maps of non-native aquatic species richness by compiling occurrence data on exotic animal and plant species from publicly accessible databases. Using a dasymetric model of human population density and a spatially explicit model of recreational freshwater fishing demand, we analysed the effect of these metrics of human influence on the degree of invasion at the watershed scale, while controlling for spatial and sampling bias. We also assessed the effects that a temporal mismatch between occurrence data (collected since 1815) and cross-sectional predictors (developed using 2010 data) may have on model fit. ResultsNon-native aquatic species richness exhibits a highly patchy distribution, with hotspots in the Northeast, Great Lakes, Florida, and human population centres on the Pacific coast. These richness patterns are correlated with population density, but are much more strongly predicted by patterns of recreational fishing demand. These relationships are strengthened by temporal matching of datasets and are robust to corrections for sampling effort. Main conclusionsDistributions of aquatic non-native species across the continental US are better predicted by freshwater recreational fishing than by human population density. This suggests that observed patterns are driven by a mechanistic link between recreational activity and aquatic non-native species richness and are not merely the outcome of sampling bias associated with human population density.},

title={Physiology in ecological niche modeling: using zebra mussel's upper thermal tolerance to refine model predictions through Bayesian analysis},
abstract={Climate change and human-mediated dispersal are increasingly influencing species' geographic distributions. Ecological niche models (ENMs) are widely used in forecasting species' distributions, but are weak in extrapolation to novel environments because they rely on available distributional data and do not incorporate mechanistic information, such as species' physiological response to abiotic conditions. To improve accuracy of ENMs, we incorporated physiological knowledge through Bayesian analysis. In a case study of the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha, we used native and global occurrences to obtain native and global models representing narrower and broader understanding of zebra mussel' response to temperature. We also obtained thermal limit and survival information for zebra mussel from peer-reviewed literature and used the two types of information separately and jointly to calibrate native models. We showed that, compared to global models, native models predicted lower relative probability of presence along zebra mussel's upper thermal limit, suggesting the shortcoming of native models in predicting zebra mussel's response to warm temperature. We also found that native models showed improved prediction of relative probability of presence when thermal limit was used alone, and best approximated global models when both thermal limit and survival data were used. Our result suggests that integration of physiological knowledge enhances extrapolation of ENM in novel environments. Our modeling framework can be generalized for other species or other physiological limits and may incorporate evolutionary information (e.g. evolved thermal tolerance), thus has the potential to improve predictions of species' invasive potential and distributional response to climate change.},

abstract={Dreissena spp. are aggressive invaders of many waterbodies worldwide. However, the accurate assessment of their spatial distribution in large rivers is difficult using traditional sampling techniques such as Ponar grabs or SCUBA diving. The aim of this study was to use sonar technologies and underwater imagery (videos, still images) in tandem with traditional Ponar sampling to predict Dreissena presence, and produce a habitat suitability map to enhance our understanding of its spatial distribution in the lower Niagara River, New York, USA. Geo-referenced maps of environmental variables were generated using three sonar technologies: side scan sonar, multibeam sonar, and an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler. Dreissena presence/absence was determined at 102 sites along a 10 km stretch using Ponar grabs supplemented by an underwater imagery. Substrate and near-bottom flow were the most important variables affecting Dreissena distribution. Habitats with coarse substrate and near-bottom flow of 0.6-0.80 m/s were predicted to be most often occupied. The habitat suitability model indicates that almost 90\% of the stream bed in the river can be considered highly- or moderately suitable habitat. Our results demonstrate that supplementing traditional sampling with sonar technologies and underwater imagery can greatly improve Dreissena distribution assessment at the ecosystem scale.},

Few areas appear immune to invasions, some of which unfold over decades to centuries as species' ranges slowly expand across the landscape. A plethora of ecological effects have been attributed to invasive species, and other global change processes and widespread habitat destruction will likely multiply these effects. Many conservationists now consider invasive species among the top threats to biological diversity and are grappling with identifying pragmatic, effective solutions. They know that the future will involve mixed assemblages of native and non-native species and have important questions about which invasive species to tackle and which ones to ignore, and even whether to deliberately introduce certain species for restoration. Addressing these issues will push hard against the limits of today's ecological knowledge and our ability to predict the long-term ecological consequences of such decisions. Better envisioning the conservation goals, though, could help to guide the science.},

title={Current velocity shapes co-existence patterns among invasive Dikerogammarus species},
abstract={Facilitative interactions among co-evolved representatives of the endemic Ponto-Caspian fauna are regarded as a major factor of their invasion success. Nevertheless, the most renowned examples represent interactions between different trophic levels or functional groups, while ecologically similar species can be expected to show competition-based niche partitioning. Here, we test for differences in the realized niche of three invasive Dikerogammarus species (Crustacea: Gammaridae) in their co-occurring range. We sampled multiple habitats within sites distributed along the River Danube to test whether some environmental variables could reveal spatial niche differentiation among the three species of Dikerogammarus, and if so, to test a predictive model outside the zone of co-occurrence. Spatial niche differentiation was present among the species, primarily determined by current velocity (and associated substrate preference), likely reflecting a stress tolerance-competitive ability trade-off. Suspended matter concentration was also relevant, suggesting food resources (through filter feeding) might represent another important niche axis, somewhat loosening the terms of co-existence between D.haemobaphes and the other two species. Environmental variables could effectively explain the absence of D.bispinosus in the Lower Danube, implying that the co-existence of the three species is possible only along a sufficiently wide current velocity gradient, and the observed turnovers are the result of niche expansion in the absence of the stronger competitor. Hence, differences in invasion success may be attributed to a stress tolerance-competitive ability trade-off. Our results suggest the advantage of D.villosus is attributable to its competitive dominance, allowing it to monopolize lentic and/or structured habitats, which represents a fortunate pre-adaptation to anthropogenic alterations of aquatic ecosystems. The presence of D.villosus does not greatly affect the expansion of D.haemobaphes; however, the exclusion of D.bispinosus from lentic habitats by D.villosus probably strongly limits its potential to spread by active dispersal.},

title={Modeling the interactive effects of nutrient loads, meteorology, and invasive mussels on suitable habitat for Bighead and Silver Carp in Lake Michigan},
abstract={Anthropogenic stressors that affect ecological processes in the Laurentian Great Lakes can impact their susceptibility to bioinvasions. BigheadHypophthalmichthys nobilisand Silver CarpH. molitrix, collectively `bigheaded carps' (BHC), are planktivorous fishes threatening to invade Lake Michigan. While previous studies indicate the lake contains habitat suitable for BHC growth, there is a need to understand how anthropogenic-driven changes to the abiotic and biotic environment could alter its vulnerability to BHC. We applied a spatially explicit model of BHC growth rate potential (GRP; g g(-1)d(-1)) to nine biophysical model scenarios to evaluate changes in habitat suitability in Lake Michigan. Scenarios differed in meteorology (cool, reference, warm), annual tributary phosphorus loads (0, 3300, and 5600 MTA), and the presence/absence of invasive dreissenid mussels. Mussel effects on BHC GRP relied on their contact with the surface mixed layer (SML), the depth of which was affected by meteorology. The warm year advanced the expansion of Bighead Carp habitat by increasing temperature-dependent foraging rates and lessening the time of competitive interaction with mussels due to earlier stratification separating mussels from the SML. Phosphorus loads were the most influential driver of the lake's suitability. Compared to present conditions, we estimate BHC could have grown an additional 8-40\% annually in the 1980s when mussels were not in the lake and phosphorus loads were higher. Our study demonstrates how climate change and nutrient enrichment can increase Lake Michigan's vulnerability to BHC by affecting thermal regime and productivity, thereby limiting negative effects of dreissenid mussels on BHC growth.},

title={Lake Champlain offshore benthic invertebrate community before and after zebra mussel invasion},
abstract={Benthic invertebrates are important bio-indicators of water quality and play a significant role in aquatic systems. Lake Champlain has limited benthic invertebrate data which hinders development of food web models, assessment of invasive species impacts, and evaluation of management actions. In June 2016, we assessed benthic invertebrates along three transects in the main basin of Lake Champlain ranging from 5 to 100 m, and then compared results to densities from a limited survey in 1991 prior to the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) invasion. In 2016, total biomass and density were 1-2 orders of magnitude greater at 5 m than at 20-100 m. Zebra mussels, chironomids, oligochaetes, and gastropods were dominant at 5 m, and oligochaetes and sphaeriids were dominant at 20-100 m. Total density at the 5-m site was 94\% lower in 2016 compared to 1991, but similar at the 100-m site. Diporeia, while abundant in many freshwater bodies, is historically rare in Lake Champlain and was not detected in our sampling. Because Lake Champlain benthic invertebrate densities are low and display dissimilar distributions to the Great Lakes, we hypothesize the offshore fish community is likely much more reliant on pelagic rather than benthic production. Although the current composition and biomass suggest the benthic community in Lake Champlain may not be greatly impacted by an invasion of quagga mussel (D. rostriformis bugensis), the potential for quaggas to re-route energy from pelagic to benthic habitats, as it has in the Great Lakes, could limit the Lake Champlain offshore fish community.

abstract={The risk of quagga mussel (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis Andrusov 1897) establishment into water-bodies of the western US has expanded the geographic concern regarding the ecological and economic impacts this species will have in aquatic ecosystems. Thresholds based on calcium concentrations, an element critical for mussel growth and physiology, have been used as a primary predictor of quagga mussel establishment success to aid management decisions. We evaluated the invasion potential of quagga mussels in low calcium waters using laboratory experiments to compare the survival, growth and reproductive potential of adult mussels held for 90 days at low (9 and 12 ppm), moderate (15 to 32 ppm) and high (72 ppm) calcium water concentrations. In conjunction with adult experiments, veliger stage survival, growth and settlement were evaluated under similar low, moderate, and high calcium water treatments. Adult mussels survived, grew and showed reproductive potential in low calcium water (12 ppm). Veligers were also able to survive, grow and settle in low calcium water. Higher levels of natural seston biomass appeared to improve adult mussel life history performance in low calcium water. Survival curve analysis predicted that 99\% adult mortality could occur in < 170 days at 9 ppm and 12 ppm, however water with > 15 ppm could have adults surviving more than a year. The results from these bioassays provide further evidence that quagga mussels have higher risk of establishment in low calcium lakes if habitats exist that have slightly elevated calcium. These results should help emphasize the vulnerability of water-body in the 12 to 15 ppm calcium range that could potentially be at risk of establishing sustainable quagga mussel populations. Furthermore, these results provide insights into the uncertainty of using a single parameter in assigning establishment risk given the complexity of variables in specific water-bodies that influence life history performance of introduced species.},

title={Food depletion regulates the demography of invasive dreissenid mussels in a stratified lake},
abstract={Lake stratification produces sharp gradients in temperature and pelagic resources which have cascading effects on the traits of aquatic populations, including invasive species and their ecosystem impacts. We study the consequences of such common environmental gradients on the demography of quagga mussels, one of the world's most aggressive invasive species. Coupling a series of in situ experiments with a biophysical model of the pelagic community, we quantify mussel growth and recruitment in littoral vs. profundal benthic habitats of eastern Lake Erie. We found that both severe food depletion and cold temperatures in the hypolimnion during summer stratification cause mussels to grow twice as slowly and currently inhibit recruitment in profundal compared to littoral habitats. Together with the high biomass and large mean mussel size found in long-term monitoring surveys in the profundal habitats, our results imply that mussels successfully colonizing profundal habitats have relatively long lifespans with low growth rates, and therefore lower productivity, compared to mussels in shallow areas. Consequently, the bulk of dreissenid biomass in Lake Erie and other Great Lakes found in the vast but resource-poor profundal habitats may have very limited impacts on epilimnetic communities compared to mussels in littoral areas. By contrast, mussels in profundal habitats strongly reduce food availability to hypolimnetic communities throughout the year. Thus, our results explain how the ecosystem impacts of sessile freshwater invaders are likely to vary among habitats and lakes depending on the relative size of profundal populations and the extent of stratification.},

title={Potential effects of invasive Dreissenid mussels on a pelagic freshwater ecosystem: using an ecosystem model to simulate mussel invasion in a sockeye lake},
abstract={Dreissenid (zebra and quagga) mussels are spreading across North America and having an impact on freshwater ecosystems, through bottom-up impacts. Lakes in British Columbia are known to be at risk for mussel invasion due to favourable water chemistry and significant cross-border boat movements. This project uses Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) to model a hypothetical mussel invasion into Shuswap Lake: one of the most popular lakes for recreation and one of the most productive sockeye lakes in the province. A model of the ecosystem was fit to available data and then projected forward to examine the effects from three different scenarios: no invasion, a base mussel invasion scenario resulting in a carrying capacity of 5 g.m(-2) and 15 g.m(-2) of zebra and quagga mussels, respectively, and a high density invasion scenario resulting in a combined carrying capacity of 40 g.m(-2) of Dreissenid mussels. The greatest ecosystem impacts resulted in declines in large piscivorous rainbow trout and lake trout, followed by non-anadromous kokanee salmon, with little effect observed on anadromous sockeye salmon. Two mechanisms limit the predicted impact of mussels in the study system: (1) paucity of shallow water habitat, limiting the scope for invasion; and (2) movements by fish in and out of the system. This second mechanism includes some resident species that rear for up to three years upstream of the lake, as well as anadromous species, which spend most of their life in the marine environment. While most of the effects are observed on recreationally important species, there is also the possibility of mussels spreading from this system into others within the same watershed, reiterating the importance of preventing the invasion and spread of Dreissenid mussels.},

abstract={Ecological niche modeling has emerged as a notable tool in invasive species risk assessment. However, the advances of the ecological niche theory, the basis of ecological niche modeling, are not matched by availability of detailed biological data. Thus, we proposed a conceptual framework to refine the boundaries of ecological niche, differentiating the species' existence status (survival, growth, and reproduction) based on physiological limits of major life history characteristics. We discussed differences between the classic and the proposed frameworks and emphasized the importance of the time axis in understanding species' existence status. We exemplified the implementation potential of this framework by reviewing published studies of physiological limits (temperature and salinity) for survival, growth, and reproduction of invasive freshwater bivalves in USA. We found considerable amount of physiological information through the literature review, though there is a research bias toward more influential invasive species (vs. less influential invasive species), temperature tolerance (vs. salinity tolerance), and survival limits (vs. growth and reproduction limits); filling the knowledge gaps will strengthen the potential of the proposed framework. Our framework addresses the lack of long-term field data, but is limited in that one can only identify unsuitable instead of suitable conditions for species, given incomplete understanding of species' physiological tolerance. Future studies may consider developing new algorithms that utilize physiological limits as priors in a Bayesian approach. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

title={Inter-basin water transfers and the expansion of aquatic invasive species},
abstract={Inter-basin Water Transfers (IBWT) are recognized as one of the major pathways of freshwater invasion. They provide a direct link between previously isolated catchments and may modify the habitat conditions of the receiving waters such that they become more favourable for the establishment of invasive species. Combined, IBWT and invasive species will intensify the stress upon native species and ecosystems. Using the Severn and Thames Rivers two of the largest river systems in Great Britain as a case study, here we assess the potential influence of IBWT on the expansion of invasive species and thus their impact on biodiversity conservation. The Thames Valley is subject to extensive water abstraction, and an increasing population means that supplemented flow from the River Severn is being considered. Multi scale Suitability Models, based on climate and water chemistry respectively, provided novel evidence that there is serious risk for further spread of invasive species in the focus area, particularly of the quagga mussel, a recent invader of the Thames River. Native freshwater mussels are particularly vulnerable to changing environmental conditions, and may suffer the decrease in alkalinity and increase in sedimentation associated with an IBWT from the lower Severn to the upper Thames. Regional models suggest considerable overlap between the areas suitable for three vulnerable native freshwater mussels and the expansion of invasive species that negatively impact upon the native mussels. This study illustrates the use of novel spatially-explicit techniques to help managers make informed decisions about the risks associated with introducing aquatic invasive species under different engineering scenarios. Such information may be especially important under new legislation (e.g. EU Invasive Species Regulation No 1143/2014) which increases the responsibility of water managers to contain and not transfer invasive species into new locations.

abstract={The ecosystem services approach to conservation is becoming central to environmental policy decision making. While many negative biological invasion-driven impacts on ecosystem structure and functioning have been identified, much less was done to evaluate their ecosystem services. In this paper, we focus on the often-overlooked ecosystem services provided by three notable exotic ecosystem engineering bivalves, the zebra mussel, the quagga mussel, and the golden mussel. One of the most significant benefits of invasive bivalves is water filtration, which results in water purification and changes rates of nutrient cycling, thus mitigating the effects of eutrophication. Mussels are widely used as sentinel organisms for the assessment and biomonitoring of contaminants and pathogens and are consumed by many fishes and birds. Benefits of invasive bivalves are particularly relevant in human-modified ecosystems. We summarize the multiple ecosystem services provided by invasive bivalves and recommend including the economically quantifiable services in the assessments of their economic impacts. We also highlight important ecosystem disservices by exotic bivalves, identify data limitations, and future research directions. This assessment should not be interpreted as a rejection of the fact that invasive mussels have negative impacts, but as an attempt to provide additional information for scientists, managers, and policymakers.},

Some questions have been answered satisfactorily, others require more data and thought, and others might benefit from being reformulated or abandoned. Actions that might speed progress include careful development of trait-based approaches; strategic collection and publication of new data, including more frequent publication of negative results; replacement of expert opinion with hard data where needed; careful consideration of whether questions really need to be answered, especially in cases where answers are being provided for managers and policy-makers; explicit attention to and testing of the domains of theories; integrating invasions better into an ecosystem context; and remembering that our predictive ability is limited and will remain so for the foreseeable future.},

abstract={Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) have exacerbated the decline of native freshwater mussels (order Unionida) in North America since their arrival in the 1980s. Options for controlling invasive mussels, particularly in unionid mussel habitats, are limited. Previously, carbon dioxide (CO2) showed selective toxicity for zebra mussels, relative to unionids, when applied in cool water (12 degrees C). We first determined 96-h lethal concentrations of CO(2)at 5 and 20 degrees C to zebra mussels and responses of juvenile plain pocketbook (Lampsilis cardium). Next, we compared the time to lethality for zebra mussels at 5, 12, and 20 degrees C during exposure to partial pressure of CO2(PCO2) values of 110 to 120 atm (1 atm = 101.325 kPa) and responses of juvenile plain pocketbook and fragile papershell (Leptodea fragilis). We found efficacious CO(2)treatment regimens at each temperature that were minimally lethal to unionids. At 5 degrees C, plain pocketbook survived 96-h exposure to the highest PCO(2)treatment (139 atm). At 20 degrees C, the 96-h lethal concentration to 10\% of animals (LC10) for plain pocketbook (173 atm PCO2, 95\% CI 147-198 atm) was higher than the LC99 for zebra mussels (118 atm PCO2, 95\% CI 109-127 atm). Lethal time to 99\% mortality (LT99) of zebra mussels in 110 to 120 atm PCO(2)ranged from 100 h at 20 degrees C to 300 h at 5 degrees C. Mean survival of both plain pocketbook and fragile papershell juveniles exceeded 85\% in LT99 CO(2)treatments at all temperatures.

abstract={Quagga mussels (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) are highly fecund broadcast spawners invasive to fresh-waters of North America and western Europe. We hypothesized that environmental cues from phytoplankton can trigger gamete release in quagga mussels. Nutritious algae may stimulate dreissenid spawning, but less palatable food, such as bloom-forming cyanobacteria, could be a hindrance. The objective of our study was to test whether exposure to cyanobacteria can inhibit quagga mussel spawning and fertilization. We assessed spawning in the presence of serotonin, a known spawning inducer, where adult quagga mussels placed in individual vials were exposed to 13 cyanobacteria cultures and purified algal toxin (microcystin-LR) with artificial lake water as the control. Fertilization success was evaluated by combining eggs with sperm in conjunction with cyanobacteria, and enumerating zygote formation marked by cellular cleavage. Several cyanobacterial strains reduced spawning and fertilization success, but microcystin-LR had no effect. Fertilization was more sensitive to cyanobacteria than gamete release. Only 1 culture, Aphanizomenon floc-aquae, inhibited spawning, whereas 6 cultures consisting of Anabaena flos-aquae, Dolichospermum lemmermang Gloeotrichia echinulata, Lyngbya wollei, and 2 Microcystis aeruginosa isolates reduced fertilization rates by up to 44\%. The effects of cyanobacteria on reproduction in invasive freshwater mussels in the wild have not yet been identified. However, our laboratory studies show that concentrations of cyanobacteria that are possible during bloom conditions probably limit reproduction. Reproductive consequences on wild populations may become more prevalent as cyanobacteria blooms occur earlier in the year, making overlap between blooms and mussel spawning more common. Describing the mechanism by which cyanobacteria inhibit spawning and fertilization could reveal novel control methods to limit reproduction of this invasive species},

abstract={The distribution, density, biomass and size-structure of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) population in Lake Winnipeg were examined between 2017 and 2019. Zebra mussels have colonized most of the available hard substrate in the south basin and Narrows region, but colonization of the north basin remains low at present, even on suitable substrate. Numerical densities and shell free biomass peaked at 5530 +/- 953 m(-2) and 64.7 +/- 57.9 g shell free dry mass m(-2) respectively. The distribution appeared to be strongly limited by substrate type and availability, with further limitations on the distribution imposed by physical disturbance in shallow waters and unsuitable substrate in deeper areas of the lake. Zebra mussels <1 year old dominated the populations, and individuals >18 mm were exceedingly rare. Poor recruitment was observed at sites along the eastern side of the south basin compared to elsewhere in the lake. The proximate causes of these differences in colonization success and recruitment are not clear, but may be in part due to heterogeneous patterns of key physico-chemical environmental conditions such as calcium concentrations required for successful development of juvenile mussels and colder water temperatures in the north basin. This study provides a baseline of information on which to track further expansion of zebra mussels in Lake Winnipeg and assist efforts to develop an understanding of how zebra mussels may affect the ecology of Lake Winnipeg.

title={Lake Michigan's suitability for bigheaded carp: The importance of diet flexibility and subsurface habitat},
abstract={As bighead (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) and silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix)-collectively bigheaded carp (BHC)-arrive at Lake Michigan's doorstep, questions remain as to whether there is sufficient food to support these invasive filter-feeding fishes in the upper Laurentian Great Lakes. Previous studies suggest that suitable BHC habitat is limited to a few productive, nearshore areas. However, those studies did not consider the influence of BHC's diet plasticity or the presence of spatially-discrete subsurface prey resources. This study aimed to characterise Lake Michigan's suitability for BHC and evaluate the importance of these considerations in habitat suitability assessments. We used simulated outputs of prey biomass (phytoplankton, zooplankton, and detritus) and water temperature from a three-dimensional biophysical model of Lake Michigan to evaluate growth rate potential (GRP, quantitative index of habitat suitability) of adult BHC throughout the entire volume of the lake. Our GRP model applied a foraging model and a bioenergetics model to translate prey concentrations and water temperatures into habitat quality indexed by individual fish growth rate. We defined suitable habitat as habitats that can support GRP >= 0 g g(-1) day(-1). We developed six feeding scenarios to evaluate the impact of diet flexibility and subsurface prey resources on suitable habitat quantity. Scenarios were defined by the number of prey types the fish could consume and the depths at which they could feed (surface or whole water column). Consistent with previous studies, we found that habitats with the highest quality were concentrated near river mouths and in eutrophic areas of Green Bay. However, in contrast to previous studies, we found suitable offshore habitat for bighead carp owing to our added considerations of diet plasticity and subsurface prey resources. For silver carp, these considerations extended suitable habitat within Green Bay and in some tributary-influenced nearshore areas, but offshore areas remained predominantly unsuitable in all feeding scenarios. Differences in simulated habitat suitability between these two species probably reflect differences in energy density and mass of the specific fishes we used in our model. However, reports of these two species in environments where they coexist indicate that bighead carp grow at faster rates than silver carp, as our model simulated. Our vertical analysis at Muskegon, MI, U.S.A. indicates that subsurface temperature and prey biomass are not only sufficient to support bighead carp growth but provide maximum habitat quality during late summer stratification. Overall, our study demonstrates that BHC are capable of surviving and growing in much larger areas of Lake Michigan than predicted by previous studies, and thus suggests that the risk of establishment is not sufficiently reduced by low plankton concentrations. Maps generated by our model identified the potential for cross-lake migration corridors that may facilitate and accelerate lake-wide movements. We believe these maps could be used to prioritise surveillance protocols by identifying areas to which BHC might spread upon entering the lake. More broadly, this research demonstrates how the physiology and trophic ecology of BHC contributes to their high invasive capacity and can permit their survival in novel environments.},

Their spread continues to new states and watersheds despite a wealth of research and outreach campaigns, albeit at a slowed pace.

Veliger counts and fixed hard surface monitoring suggest that a population is established within the lower Susquehanna River to the head of the Chesapeake Bay. A relatively narrow tidal-freshwater habitat envelope with suitable salinity may serve to restrict zebra mussel dispersal further downstream. Dispersal to other freshwater habitats in Maryland seems likely as the current area of infestation is highly used by commercial and recreational boaters, although regulations are in place that could help slow or prevent spread. Successful invasion will likely be a function of water chemistry, which may be limiting in some parts of the state.},

Priority should be given to the establishment of a coordinated pan-Baltic monitoring programme and associated data storage and exchange, as well as the compilation of landing statistics of the round goby in commercial and recreational fisheries. While eradication is unrealistic, population control that leads to minimising the risk of transfer to yet uncolonised areas in the Baltic Sea and adjacent waterbodies is feasible. This should comprise the requirement that the species be landed in commercial fishery bycatch, the management of ships' ballast water and sediments, and hull fouling of inland and sea-going vessels, including recreational boats.

High clearance rates (CRs) and dense populations underpin their ecological impacts. CRs, however, are highly variable, as are environmental factors that regulate them. Despite their widespread distribution in Europe and North America, knowledge of how multiple environmental factors regulate CRs of quagga mussels remains limited. We investigated quagga mussel CRs under varying conditions including water temperature, food availability, habitat depth, flow velocity, and duration of incubation in chambers with both static and flowing water. We found that CR was positively related to water temperature and initial food concentration in static chambers. When coupled with limited food concentration, coldwater (7.5 degrees C), due to a deep-water upwelling event, produced very low CR (similar to 10x lower) compared to warmer water (12-24 degrees C) (0.47 vs. 3.12-5.84 L g(-1) DW h(-1)). Mussels from deeper water (20 m) had CRs that were similar to 3.5x higher than from shallower depths (2-10 m) and CRs were inversely affected by total mussel dry weight. Flowrates from1 to 22 cms(-1) generated a unimodal pattern of CR with an optimal flow velocity of 6-12 cm s(-1) (similar to 2x higher than suboptimal CRs). Enhanced flow velocity (22 cm s(-1)), reflective of storm conditions in shallow waters, significantly increased the closing/reopening activity of mussel valves relative to lower velocities (1-12 cm s(-1)). Incubation time had a strong negative effect (similar to 2-4x reduction) on CRs likely reflecting refiltration in static chambers versus food saturation of mussels in flowing chambers, respectively. Our findings highlight how multiple factors can influence quagga mussel CRs by factors of 2-10. Givenwidespread habitat heterogeneity in large aquatic ecosystems, whole-lake estimates of mussel impacts should include multiple regulatory factors that affect mussel filtration.

title={Invasion history, distribution, and relative abundances of Dreissena bugensis in the old world: a synthesis of data},
abstract={We examined trends in expansion patterns and relative abundances of Dreissena bugensis in reservoirs and major river systems in eastern Europe. Based on our own data and data from the literature, it is apparent that trends were variable across river basins and not easily related to environmental conditions. In some cases these did not conform to the patterns typically found for dreissenids. In the early period of expansion beyond its native range in the Dnieper-Bug delta and estuary, D. bugensis rapidly replaced Dreissena polymorpha in the upper Dnieper River system, but increased only gradually and over time became less abundant relative to D. polymorpha in the Don-Manych River system. Contrary to the Dnieper and Don River systems, in the Volga River system considerable spatial variability in relative abundances was apparent, particularly in northern reservoirs. Moreover, even though D. bugensis usually displaces D. polymorpha as the dominant dreissenid, the latter can remain dominant in certain types of habitats where conditions are less favourable for the former. Suggested factors that may be responsible for differences in invasion patterns in the river systems may include differential responses to temperature, or to some other factor(s) associated with geographical latitude, the level of water mineralization, and selective predation by molluscivorous fish. In particular, the northward expansion of D. bugensis seems to be limited by temperature. The lack of long-term data on appropriate scales precludes linking these differences to specific features within the environment, but our comparisons indicate that the expansion of D. bugensis relative to D. polymorpha is more complex than previously believed.},

title={Metabarcoding of native and invasive species in stomach contents of Great Lakes fishes},
abstract={As aquatic invasive species (AIS) proliferate worldwide, a better understanding of their roles in invaded habitats is needed to inform management and introduction prevention strategies and priorities. Metabarcoding of stomach content DNA (scDNA) shows considerable promise in such regard. We thus metabarcoded scDNA from two non-native fish species (alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) and rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax)), and three native ones (bloater (Coregonus hoyi), ninespine stickleback (Pungitius pungitius), and slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus)). Fishes (N = 376) were sampled in spring 2009 and 2010 from 73-128 m depths at three Lake Michigan sites. Four mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase 1 (CO1) primer sets designed to target five potential AIS prey, and a universal aquatic invertebrate CO1 primer set targeting both native and AIS prey were used. Quality controlled prey amplicons were matched to three AIS prey:Bythotrephes longimanus(mean percent frequency occurrence, all samples = 7\%),Cercopagis pengoi(5\%), andDreissena rostriformis bugensis(11\%). Neither invasive preyDreissena polymorphanorHemimysis anomalawere detected. Native preyLeptodiaptomus sicilis,Limnocalanus macrurus, andMysis diluvianawere relatively common in scDNA (respective mean percent occurrences, all samples: 48\%, 25\%, 42\%). Analysis of variation in prey occurrences for sample site, predator species, sample year, sample depth, and predator total length (TL) indicated site and predator species were most important. However,B.longimanusoccurrence in scDNA depended upon predator TL, perhaps indicative of its unique defensive spine limiting susceptibility to predation until fishes exceed species-specific gape-based limitations. Our analysis of native and invasive prey species indicated possible indirect AIS impacts such as native predators switching their diet due to AIS-driven losses of preferred native prey. Metabarcoding demonstrated that AIS are integrated components of the offshore Lake Michigan food web, with both native and non-native predators, and both invasive and native prey are affecting species interactions across multiple trophic levels.},

title={Factors affecting the recruitment of Amphibalanus improvisus and Dreissena polymorpha in a highly eutrophic brackish bay},
abstract={Species invasions are modifying ecosystems worldwide. Coexistence of invasive species of no common evolutionary history in their new ranges enables the study of ecological rules shaping novel communities at their initial stages. In oligohaline parts of the Baltic Sea, the most dominant and widespread epifaunal suspension feeders are invasive mussels Dreissena polymorpha and cirripeds Amphibalanus improvisus. This study experimentally evaluated recruitment and microhabitat use in response to environmental forcing in these two species in a eutrophic bay. Recruitment was structured by different microhabitat exploitation patterns coupled with both individual and interactive effects of several environmental gradients. Despite functional similarity, the importance of environmental gradients differed between these species: mussel recruitment was best explained by temperature while barnacle recruitment was best explained by wave exposure. Zebra mussels were more fastidious about surface orientation than barnacles. The preferred orientations also differed between species, as mussels strongly preferred horizontal surfaces, while barnacles were more abundant on vertical surfaces. Increase in one species also predicted well the abundance of the other, especially for barnacles, as mussel abundance was the best predictor of barnacle abundance over all the other factors. The extent of microhabitat segregation correlated weakly over the studied range of the most important environmental gradients. The study shows that coexistence of functionally similar non-native D. polymorpha and A. improvisus in their sympatric range is likely determined by complex interactions between these species, their different microhabitat exploitation patterns, environmental limitations and optima.

title={Assessing the effects of climate change on aquatic invasive species},
abstract={Different components of global environmental change are typically studied and managed independently, although there is a growing recognition that multiple drivers often interact in complex and nonadditive ways. We present a conceptual framework and empirical review of the interactive effects of climate change and invasive species in freshwater ecosystems, Climate change is expected to result in warmer water temperatures, shorter duration of ice cover, altered streamflow patterns, increased salinization, and increased demand for water storage and conveyance structures. These changes will alter the pathways by which non-native species enter aquatic systems by expanding fish-culture facilities and water gardens to new areas and by facilitating the spread of species during floods. Climate change will influence the likelihood of new species becoming established by eliminating cold temperatures or winter hypoxia that currently prevent survival and by increasing the construction of reservoirs that serve as hotspots for invasive species. Climate change will modify the ecological impacts of invasive species by enhancing their competitive and predatory effects on native species and by increasing the virulence of some diseases. As a result of climate change, new prevention and control strategies such as barrier construction or removal efforts may be needed to control invasive species that currently have only moderate effects or that are limited by seasonally unfavorable conditions, Although most researchers focus on how climate change will increase the number and severity of invasions, some invasive coldwater species may be unable to persist under the new climate conditions. Our findings highlight the complex interactions between climate change and invasive species that will influence how aquatic ecosystems and their biota will respond to novel environmental conditions.},

title={Status of Freshwater Mussels (Unionidae) in the French Creek Watershed, USA at the Onset of Invasion by Round Goby, Neogobius melanostomus},
abstract={Freshwater mussels are an imperiled group of organisms that are vital to aquatic ecosystems. Services performed by freshwater mussels, coupled with their use for biomonitoring, make them an invaluable asset. Neogobius melanostomus (Round Goby), a recently introduced invasive species to the French Creek watershed, was once restricted to the watershed of Lake Erie in Pennsylvania. The Round Goby's propensity to consume Dreissena polymorpha (Zebra Mussel) and Dreissena bugensis (Quagga Mussel) in their native habitat raises concerns about this recent introduction into Pennsylvania's Allegheny River watershed. Since the discovery of their introduction within the watershed, we have followed the range expansion and dispersal rate of Round Gobies, which makes this study unique. The objectives of this study were to quantify baseline data on the contemporary diversity and abundance of unionid mussels in the upper French Creek watershed, and to explore potential habitat factors that influence or limit the size of the mussel populations. We gathered baseline data on freshwater mussel diversity and abundances across eight sites in the French Creek watershed and examined substrate particle size and host availability as potential limiting factors of the freshwater mussel distribution. Freshwater mussel surveys were conducted during the summer months (July-September) of 2017 using area-constrained surveys. Results showed a significant relationship between mussel diversity and substrate particle size (p < 0.05). From the data collected, we were able to calculate population estimates for the species found across the sample sites. Our results regarding the locations of native mussel populations and characteristics of their habitat provide the needed insight for establishing priority areas for the conservation of freshwater mussels, facilitating planning for protection, mitigation, and adaptation as the invasive Round Goby continues its spread.},

title={Evolutionary mechanisms of habitat invasions, using the copepod Eurytemora affinis as a model system},
abstract={The study of the copepod Eurytemora affinis has provided unprecedented insights into mechanisms of invasive success. In this invited review, I summarize a subset of work from my laboratory to highlight key insights gained from studying E. affinis as a model system. Invasive species with brackish origins are overrepresented in freshwater habitats. The copepod E. affinis is an example of such a brackish invader, and has invaded freshwater habitats multiple times independently in recent years. These invasions were accompanied by the evolution of physiological tolerance and plasticity, increased body fluid regulation, and evolutionary shifts in ion transporter (V-type H+ ATPase, Na+, K+-ATPase) activity and expression. These evolutionary changes occurred in parallel across independent invasions in nature and in laboratory selection experiments. Selection appears to act on standing genetic variation during invasions, and maintenance of this variation is likely facilitated through `beneficial reversal of dominance' in salinity tolerance across habitats. Expression of critical ion transporters is localized in newly discovered Crusalis leg organs. Increased freshwater tolerance is accompanied by costs to development time and greater requirements for food. High-food concentration increases low-salinity tolerance, allowing saline populations to invade freshwater habitats. Mechanisms observed here likely have relevance for other taxa undergoing fundamental niche expansions.},

abstract={We performed dynamic linear modeling analysis on fish contaminant data collected from the Ontario Ministry of the Environment and Environment Canada to examine long-term trends of total mercury (THg) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in Lake Erie. Several sport fish species (walleye, smallmouth bass, rainbow trout) with differences in their diet habits, food competition strategies and foraging patterns are characterized by weakly increasing trends of their THg levels in Lake Erie after the mid- or late 1990s. Similarly, our analysis shows that the decline rates of the PCB body burdens in white bass, smallmouth bass, freshwater drum and whitefish have slowed down or have switched to weakly increasing rates over the last decade. Our analysis also provides evidence that the rainbow trout and coho salmon PCB concentrations have been decreasing steadily but the associated rates were fairly weak. The systematic shifts in energy trophodynamics along with the food web alterations induced from the introduction of non-native species, the new role of the sediments as a net contaminant source, and the potentially significant fluxes from the atmosphere stand out as some of the hypotheses proposed to explain the limited Lake Erie response in recent years to the various contamination mitigation strategies.

title={Interaction between macroinvertebrate abundance and habitat use by diving ducks during winter on northeastern Lake Ontario},
abstract={Although numbers of buffleheads (Bucephala albeola), common goldeneyes (Bucephala clangula) and long-tailed ducks (Clangula hyemalis) over-wintering on Lake Ontario have increased substantially over the past two decades, factors influencing habitat use and the potential for competition have not been investigated. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between prey availability and community structure of diving ducks during winter on northeastern Lake Ontario. Benthic and nektonic samples collected during fall, winter, and spring 2002-2004 indicated that macroinvertebrate numbers differed by location but generally did not decline throughout winter. Large accumulations of macroinvertebrates, apparently moved by wave action and currents, were documented in nearshore areas. Surveys showed that diving ducks congregated in mixed species flocks within areas of higher food abundance. Mixed species flocks were common in nearshore areas, likely because energy-dense foods (Amphipoda and Chironomidae) were abundant in the narrow zone of shallow water, close to shore. Although macroinvertebrate numbers likely affected habitat use by diving ducks, birds did not greatly reduce abundance of macroinvertebrates. It is unlikely that exploitative competition was occurring and interference competition appeared below threshold levels that would cause species to spatially segregate. Overall, our results suggest that food availability is not a limiting factor for buffleheads, common goldeneyes, or long-tailed ducks wintering on northeastern Lake Ontario.},

abstract={The Asian clam Corbicula fluminea is among the most prolific aquatic invaders in the world; but in colder mid latitude areas, like the Laurentian Great Lakes, their population expansion has likely been limited by poor over winter survival. In these areas, Asian clams are typically found in thermal refugia like warmwater discharges from industrial facilities. We sought to identify the current extent of Asian clam populations in Lake Michigan and waters immediately adjacent to it, specifically at locations most likely to harbor overwintering populations - industrial warmwater discharges. During April-May 2017, we surveyed 17 locations around Lake Michigan. Evidence of Asian clam populations was found at four sites, though live specimens (n = 3) were only found at the Indiana Harbor Ship Canal in East Chicago, IN. Shells or fragments of shells were found at Green Bay, WI, Waukegan, IL, and Port Sheldon, MI. Our findings indicate that although Asian clams are present in Lake Michigan, they are relatively rare, and remain isolated to a few small pockets of over-wintering habitat.

abstract={Phytoplankton and Microcystis aeruginosa (Kutz.) Kutz. biovolumes were characterized and modeled, respectively, with regard to hydrological and meteorological variables during zebra mussel invasion in Saginaw Bay (1990-1996). Total phytoplankton and Microcystis biomass within the inner bay were one and one-half and six times greater, respectively, than those of the outer bay. Following mussel invasion, mean total biomass in the inner bay decreased 84\% but then returned to its approximate initial value. Microcystis was not present in the bay during 1990 and 1991 and thereafter occurred at/in 52\% of sample sites/dates with the greatest biomass occurring in 1994-1996 and within months having water temperatures >19 degrees C. With an overall relative biomass of 0.03 +/- 0.01 (mean + SE), Microcystis had, at best, a marginal impact upon holistic compositional dynamics. Dynamics of the centric diatom Cyclotella ocellata Pant. and large pennate diatoms dominated compositional dissimilarities both inter-and intra-annually. The environmental variables that corresponded with phytoplankton distributions were similar for the inner and outer bays, and together identified physical forcing and biotic utilization of nutrients as determinants of system-level biomass patterns. Nonparametric models explained 70\%-85\% of the variability in Microcystis biovolumes and identified maximal biomass to occur at total phosphorus (TP) concentrations ranging from 40 to 45 mu g . L-1. From isometric projections depicting modeled Microcystis/environmental interactions, a TP concentration of <30 mu g . L-1 was identified as a desirable contemporary ``target{''} for management efforts to ameliorate bloom potentials throughout mussel-impacted bay waters.},

abstract={The zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) provides one example of successful invaders in novel environments. However, little attention has been devoted to exploring the factors regulating zebra mussel density and population size structure at the local scale. We tested effects of physicochemical factors and fish predation on the density of zebra mussels at several sites and between years in a natural lake. Water depth and roach (Rutilus rutilus) density were the most important variables affecting local zebra mussel density. Substrate was also an important factor but affected Dreissena density only at the shallowest depth examined (2 m), which also supported a large population of the mussels. Mean shell length of Dreissena increased with water depth. Our results indicate that predation pressure, intraspecific competition, and food limitation might be responsible for variation in zebra mussel density and population size structure in space and time and that fish predation might have strong top-down effects on zebra mussel populations.},

title={Environmental DNA as a tool to help inform zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, management in inland lakes},
abstract={Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) are an aquatic invasive species that plague much of North America and are difficult to impossible to eradicate once they become established. Therefore, prevention and monitoring are key elements in the control of these organisms. Traditional microscopy is commonly used in monitoring but requires the presence of larval veligers. This limits the times when resource managers can monitor for the presence in northern lakes. A new monitoring tool, environmental DNA (eDNA), may allow for a more efficient and cost-effective monitoring program for zebra mussels. We developed and tested an environmental DNA assay in the fall and spring for zebra mussels in two Minnesota lakes, one heavily infested and another newly infested. We found that DNA copy numbers tended to be higher near the lake bottom and DNA was more concentrated in softer substrates. We also found that the amount of zebra mussel DNA sampling in winter resulted in similar results to when sampled in fall. This suggests that one could collect and analyze eDNA for zebra mussels during winter months to help inform future efforts in monitoring and control.},

abstract={Aim The introduction of non-indigenous species has resulted in wide-ranging ecological and economic impacts. Predictive modelling of the introduction and establishment of non-indigenous species is imperative to identify areas at high risk of invasion to effectively manage non-indigenous species and conserve native populations. Smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu), a warm water fish species native to central North America has negatively impacted native fish communities, including cyprinids and salmonid populations, as a result of intentional introductions. We predicted the introduction risk; species establishment based on habitat suitability; identified lakes at high risk of invasion; and finally assessed the consequential impacts on native salmon, trout and cyprinid populations. Location Ontario and British Columbia, Canada. Methods Classification tree and logistic regression models were developed and validated to predict the introduction and establishment of smallmouth bass for thousands of lakes. Results Densely human populated areas and larger lake surface areas successfully identify lakes associated with the introduction of smallmouth bass (introduction model) in British Columbia. Climate, lake morphology and water chemistry variables were the driving environmental parameters to define suitable smallmouth bass habitat (establishment model). A combination of the introduction and establishment model identified 138 lakes that are currently at risk in British Columbia to the introduction and establishment of smallmouth bass. Of these 138 high-risk lakes, 95\% of them contain at least one species of salmon, trout or cyprinid, thereby increasing the potential impact of an invasion by smallmouth bass. Main conclusions Our framework can be applied to other terrestrial and aquatic species to obtain a better understanding of the potential risk posed by a non-indigenous species to an ecosystem. Furthermore, our methodology can be used to focus management efforts on areas at higher risk (e.g. number of potential releases, more favourable habitats) to control future introductions of non-indigenous species, thereby conserving native populations.},

They include several groups of organisms, all of which have the potential to be ecosystem engineers with strong effects on the physical and chemical properties of freshwater habitats. Nevertheless, ecological and economic research on freshwater biofoulers has been limited. We predict that freshwater biofouling will become worse in the future as a result of human activities, such as anthropogenic introductions of exotic species, eutrophication, construction of artificial habitats, and climate change. Increasing demand for energy and water may raise the costs associated with freshwater biofouling prevention and damage repair.

abstract={We conducted a factorial experiment, in outdoor mesocosms, on the effects of zebra mussels and water column mixing (i.e., turbulence) on the diet, growth, and survival of larval fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas). Significant (P < 0.05) larval mortality occurred by the end of the experiment with the highest mortality (90\%) occurring in the presence of both turbulence and zebra mussels, whereas mortality was 37\% in treatment with turbulence and 17\% and 18\% in the zebra mussels treatment, and the control, respectively. The size of individual fish was significantly different among treatments at the end of the experiment and was inversely related to survival. Levels of trophic resources (i.e., phyto and zooplankton) varied among treatments and were treatment specific. Turbulent mixing facilitated removal of phytoplankton by zebra mussels by making the entire water column of the tanks available to these benthic filter feeders. Early in the experiment (Day = 0 to 14) the physical process of turbulent mixing likely caused a reduction in standing stocks of zooplankton. The interactive effect of turbulence and mussels reduced copepod and rotifer stocks, through physical processes and through filtration by zebra mussels, relative to the turbulence treatment. The reductions in the number of total zooplankton in the turbulent mixing mesocosms and the further reduction of rotifer and copepod in the turbulence and mussels treatment coincided with a period of increased reliance of larval fathead minnows on these prey. Estimates of consumption from bioenergetics modeling and measured prey standing stocks indicated caloric resources of suitable prey in turbulence treatments during the early weeks of the experiment were insufficient to prevent starvation. Early mortality in the turbulence and mussels treatment likely released surviving fish from intense intraspecific competition and resulted in higher individual growth rates. A combination of high abundance of zebra mussels in an environment with a well-mixed water column can have significant effects on larval fish survival and growth.},

title={Feasting in fresh water: impacts of food concentration on freshwater tolerance and the evolution of food x salinity response during the expansion from saline into fresh water habitats},
abstract={Saline to freshwater invasions have become increasingly common in recent years. A key hypothesis is that rates of freshwater invasions have been amplified in recent years by increased food concentration, yet this hypothesis has remained unexplored. We examined whether elevated food concentration could enhance freshwater tolerance, and whether this effect evolves following saline to freshwater invasions. We examined physiological response to salinity and food concentration in a 2x2 factorial design, using ancestral brackish and freshwater invading populations of the copepod Eurytemora affinis. We found that high food concentration significantly increases low-salinity tolerance. This effect was reduced in the freshwater population, indicating evolution following the freshwater invasion. Thus, ample food could enable freshwater invasions, allowing subsequent evolution of low-salinity tolerance even under food-poor conditions. We also compared effects of food concentration on freshwater survival between two brackish populations from the native range. Impacts of food concentration on freshwater survival differed between the brackish populations, suggesting variation in functional properties affecting their propensity to invade freshwater habitats. The key implication is that high food concentration could profoundly extend range expansions of brackishwater species into freshwater habitats, potentially allowing for condition-specific competition between saline invaders and resident freshwater species.},

abstract={In regions with abundant and diverse freshwater resources, it is difficult and costly to survey all lakes at the level required to detect invasive plants. Effective allocation of monitoring resources requires tools that identify waterbodies where exotic species are most likely to invade. We developed and tested models that predict conditions in which Eurasian watermilfoil, Myriophyllum spicatum, is most likely to survive and successfully colonize. We used logistic regression to model the likelihood of M. spicatum presence or absence using a suite of biological, chemical, and physical lake characteristics which are easily obtainable from public databases. We evaluated model fit by the Aikake criterion and model performance by the percentage of misclassification errors as well as the costs associated with acquiring data for variables modeled. Several models fit our data well, misclassifying only 1.3-11.0\% of the lakes where M. spicatum was observed, and used relatively inexpensive landscape variables (percent forest cover in a drainage basin, presence and type of public boat launch, and bedrock type) that typically exist as information layers in geographic information systems (GISs) or recreational atlases. We found that the most important factors affecting the presence or absence of M. spicatum were those that influence water quality factors known to impact M. spicatum growth, rather than factors associated with human activity and dispersal potential. In particular, the amount of forest cover in the lake watershed was consistently important and could control the level of dissolved inorganic carbon in lakes, one of the factors known to affect M. spicatum growth rates. Factors such as the number of game fish species and number and types of boat ramps or proximity to roads were generally less important lake characteristics. Our models can be useful tools for developing management strategies to prevent or slow the spread of M. spicatum and aquatic invaders, such as the zebra mussel, that can attach to it and thus be dispersed. Our models also exemplify a general approach for slowing or stopping the spread of other invading species.},

abstract={The introduction of the golden mussel, Limnoperna fortunei (Dunker, 1857) in South America was related to the discharge of ballast water, with its first record in 1991 in the La Plata River estuary. Since then, the species is spreading throughout the continent, with several economic and ecological negative consequences. Aim: To model, in the headwaters of Parana River, the spatial distribution of L. fortunei and to understand the determinants of the current pattern of species distribution and the risk of invasion of areas not yet colonized. Methods: The ecological niche of L. fortunei was modeled using the algorithm MAXENT (Maximum Entropy Method) combined with records of occurrence of the bivalve, limnological data and the shear force measured by the index Hack (SL). The evaluation of the performance of different models was based on AUC (Area Under the Curve). The analysis of each variable's contribution to the responses of the models was made based on the Jackknife test, available in the Maxent program. The models were validated with real absence data collected between 2006 and 2007. Based on the limnological characterization of the area and on outputs of the models, this analysis sought to understand the contributing aspects to the current and potential spatial distribution and to verify the risk of invasion of environments not yet colonized by the species. Results/Conclusion: The limnological characterization showed that the ecological requirements for the species as, pH, calcium, oxygen and chlorophyll a, were appropriate in both the connected stretches, invaded and non-invaded. Turbidity showed significant spatial differences which proved to be higher in environments with higher levels of Hack (SL), i.e. higher energy fluvial. In addition, the algorithm showed the importance of hydrodynamical aspects expressed by Hack index (SL) to the spatial distribution of species, since the models with the best performances were those that considered the Hack index (SL) as one of the environmental layers of the mussel's niche. All models indicated a high risk of invasion into the reservoir of Sao Simao.},

abstract={The continuous spread of invasive alien species, as zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha), is a major global concern and it is urgent to stop it. Early stages of an invasion are crucial and challenging; however, detection tools based on environmental DNA analysis are promising alternatives. We present an alternative DNA target amplification strategy for signal enhancement followed by dual-mode colorimetric naked eye and optical smartphone analysis for the early detection of zebra mussel environmental DNA. Target amplification was designed based on the nicking endonuclease probe cleavage upon probe and complementary target hybridization. The cleaved/intact probe interacts with DNA-modified nanoparticles for colorimetric detection. We have demonstrated that enzyme amplification strategy enhanced 12-fold the sensitivity by naked eye detection, achieving a detection limit of similar to 8 nM (4.48x10(10) copies) in controlled conditions, whereas target in complex environmental samples allowed the detection of 22.5 nM (1.26x10(11) copies). Competitive assays also showed that the system can discriminate specific zebra mussel DNA sequences from other DNA sequences. Additionally, smartphone analysis for DNA quantification further improved the sensitivity of its detection by 130-fold, more than 2 orders of magnitude, when applied to environmental samples. The limit of detection to 0.17 nM (9.52x10(8) copies) is based on RGB coordinates, which is especially relevant to monitor early aggregation stages, being more accurate and reducing naked eye detection subjectivity. DNA extracted from zebra mussel meat, zebra mussel contaminated river water, and non-contaminated river water samples were successfully tested. Dual-mode colorimetric detection is useful in field analysis without the need for expensive laboratory equipment.},

title={Different ammonia tolerances may facilitate spatial coexistence of Gammarus roeselii and the strong invader Dikerogammarus villosus},
abstract={The introduction of invasive species that can replace native species is one of the most critical threats to the biodiversity of aquatic systems. Here we investigated the potential contribution of one factor to the coexistence of the indigenous amphipod Gammarus roeselii and the invasive amphipod Dikerogammarus villosus in the same ecosystem (Lake Constance) within different microhabitats. We quantitatively studied the influence of ambient ammonia concentrations on the distributions of the two amphipod species. We also assessed the ammonia tolerance ranges of both species in laboratory experiments by measuring mortality rate, precopula disruption, egg mortality, and microhabitat choice. The proportion of G. roeselii among the two amphipod species was significantly positively related to the ammonia concentration in the water, which indicated that the distribution of the invasive D. villosus was limited at high ammonia concentrations. Although the mortality rates of the two species did not significantly differ, G. roeselii was more tolerant to ammonia with regard to precopula disruption, egg mortality, and microhabitat choice. The effective ammonia concentrations that led to a significantly reduced direct reproductive success in D. villosus were within the range of the highest field concentrations measured, where only G. roeselii occurred. D. villosus may have a smaller range than the indigenous G. roeselii partially because of its lower tolerance to higher ammonia concentrations, which lead to reduced reproductive success. Beside other habitat parameters differences on ammonia tolerance between the two amphipods might allow their coexistence along a gradient of microhabitats in Lake Constance.},

abstract={In June 2017, the invasion of an alien species Dreissena polymorpha was recorded in one of the quarries located in the Lake Ladoga basin (the Kelkolovo quarries, Kirovsky district, Leningrad Region). The biology of the population and the trace element composition in shells of the mollusks were studied. It is found that the population is young with a high potential for further development under favorable environmental conditions. One of the prerequisites for invasion of the species into the water body is a high water mineralization, which provides an optimum level of elements necessary for the construction of a calcareous skeleton of a large number of specimens. The main chorological types formed by zebra mussels are brushes and druses which allow the maximum use of food resources in a limited space. The role of shells in accumulation and bio-burial of some trace elements is shown.},

title={Priority setting for invasive species management: risk assessment of Ponto-Caspian invasive species into Great Britain},
abstract={Invasive species drive important ecological and economic losses across wide geographies, with some regions supporting especially large numbers of nonnative species and consequently suffering relatively high impacts. For this reason, integrated risk assessments able to screen a suite of multiple invaders over large geographic areas are needed for prioritizing the allocation of limited resources. A total of 16 Ponto-Caspian aquatic species (10 gammarids, one isopod, two mysids, and three fishes) have been short-listed as recent or potential future invaders of British waters, whose introduction and spread is of high concern. In this study, we use multiple modeling techniques to assess their risk of establishment and spread into Great Britain. Climate suitability maps for these 16 species differed depending on the eastern and western distribution of species in continental Europe, which was related to their respective migration corridor: southern (Danube-Rhine rivers), and northern (Don and Volga rivers and Baltic lakes). Species whose suitability was high across large parts of Great Britain included four gammarids (Cheliorophium robustum, Dikerogammarus bispinosus, D. villosus, and Echinogammarus trichiatus) and a mysid (Hemimysis anomala). A climatic ``{''}heat map{''} combining the results of all 16 species together pointed to the southeast of England as the area most vulnerable to multiple invasions, particularly the Thames, Anglian, Severn, and Humber river basin districts. Regression models further suggested that alkalinity concentration >120 mg/L in southeast England may favor the establishment of Ponto-Caspian invaders. The production of integrated risk maps for future invaders provides a means for the scientifically informed prioritization of resources toward particular species and geographic regions. Such tools have great utility in helping environmental managers focus efforts on the most effective prevention, management, and monitoring programs.},

title={Effects of water depth on survival, condition and stable isotope values of three invasive dreissenid species in a deep freshwater lake},
abstract={To examine the effects of depth on the performance of the freshwater dreissenid species Dreissena polymorpha and D. rostriformis bugensis, and the brackish water dreissenid, Mytilopsis leucophaeata, a controlled experiment lasting four months was conducted in a manmade freshwater lake in the Netherlands. The three species used in the experiment were collected from other water bodies in the Netherlands. Cages containing each species in separate compartments were placed at water depths of 2, 5, 10 and 17 m from November 2009 until February 2010. Samples of individuals were retrieved at the start and at approximately four-week incubation intervals, for determination of overall survival, condition and soft tissue carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios. In contrast to the Dreissena species, survival of M. leucophaeata decreased strongly over time at each depth. Mortality increased with increasing depth and was greatest at 17 m. Survival of D. polymorpha at 17 m was much greater than that of D. rostriformis bugensis. The condition of all species after 3.5 weeks did not differ significantly from that at the start. Surviving M. leucophaeata showed a significantly reduced condition at all depths after 16 weeks. Both Dreissena species showed an improved condition at depths of 2, 5 and 10 m after 16 weeks, the greatest improvement being found at 2 m. After 16 weeks at 17 m, both Dreissena species had the lowest condition index. Stable isotope ratios of soft tissue for both Dreissena species showed a shift in delta N-15 within 3.5 weeks. The delta N-15 values of mussels held at 2-10 m fell. Those held at 17 m had values similar to that initially recorded, possibly indicative of very limited food intake at that depth or a diet similar to that at their location of origin. After 16 weeks, delta C-13 values became more negative than those at the start, in particular at 2 m. The stable isotope ratios of soft tissue of M. leucophaeata did not change at any depth throughout the experiment, possibly indicating lack of feeding in the freshwater lake. Changes in stable isotope values for both Dreissena species were reduced at 17 m. Mortality of D. polymorpha was lower at 17 m compared to the other two dreissenid species which indicated greater tolerance of habitat conditions a this deeper depth.},

title={Happy together? Avoidance of conspecifics by gregarious mussels},
abstract={Zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha is a Ponto-Caspian species invasive in Europe and North America, with great environmental impact. It lives byssally attached to hard substrata in large aggregations, which is often explained by its preferences for conspecifics, though direct evidence for such preferences has been rather limited so far. We studied the reactions of zebra mussels to conspecifics, hypothesizing that they may either be attracted to one another or form aggregations only in the absence of alternative attachment sites. In Experiment 1, we tested mussel tendency to detach from existing druses depending on druse size (2-25 individuals) and substratum type (soft: sand; hard: glass). Mussels detached significantly more often on the hard substratum and from larger druses compared to soft substratum and smaller druses, respectively. This indicates that mussels tended to avoid conspecifics at high density, particularly when alternative substratum was available. In Experiment 2, we tested the responses of single mussels to distant (3 or 15 cm) conspecifics (0, 3, 15 individuals per 2.5 l tank) on the sandy substratum. The presence of conspecifics, regardless of their distance and density, resulted in single unattached mussels staying more often in their initial positions. Mussels did not move preferentially towards or away from the conspecifics. Thus, even on unsuitable substratum mussels were not attracted by conspecifics and probably exhibited an avoidance reaction by reducing their movement. This suggests that dense mussel aggregations are formed due to the lack of available alternative attachment sites rather than due to their preferences for conspecifics.},

title={A Probability Co-Kriging Model to Account for Reporting Bias and Recognize Areas at High Risk for Zebra Mussels and Eurasian Watermilfoil Invasions in Minnesota},
abstract={Zebra mussels (ZMs) (Dreissena polymorpha) and Eurasian watermilfoil (EWM) (Myriophyllum spicatum) are aggressive aquatic invasive species posing a conservation burden on Minnesota. Recognizing areas at high risk for invasion is a prerequisite for the implementation of risk-based prevention and mitigation management strategies. The early detection of invasion has been challenging, due in part to the imperfect observation process of invasions including the absence of a surveillance program, reliance on public reporting, and limited resource availability, which results in reporting bias. To predict the areas at high risk for invasions, while accounting for underreporting, we combined network analysis and probability co-kriging to estimate the risk of ZM and EWM invasions. We used network analysis to generate a waterbody-specific variable representing boater traffic, a known high risk activity for human-mediated transportation of invasive species. In addition, co-kriging was used to estimate the probability of species introduction, using waterbody-specific variables. A co-kriging model containing distance to the nearest ZM infested location, boater traffic, and road access was used to recognize the areas at high risk for ZM invasions (AUC = 0.78). The EWM cokriging model included distance to the nearest EWM infested location, boater traffic, and connectivity to infested waterbodies (AUC = 0.76). Results suggested that, by 2015, nearly 20\% of the waterbodies in Minnesota were at high risk of ZM (12.45\%) or EWM (12.43\%) invasions, whereas only 125/18,411 (0.67\%) and 304/18,411 (1.65\%) are currently infested, respectively. Prediction methods presented here can support decisions related to solving the problems of imperfect detection, which subsequently improve the early detection of biological invasions.},

title={Meta-analysis suggests biotic resistance in freshwater environments is driven by consumption rather than competition},
abstract={Native communities are thought to mediate the establishment and performance of invasive species through competitive and consumptive interactions, a concept referred to as ``biotic resistance.'' We investigated the generality of this concept across ecosystems. Despite the conspicuousness of freshwater invasions, investigations of biotic resistance have focused mostly on terrestrial and, more recently, marine coastal communities. We collected in-situ studies that tested the impacts of native freshwater communities on invading primary producers and consumers. Meta-analysis demonstrated that evidence of competitive biotic resistance in freshwater habitats was not as strong as that in marine and terrestrial ecosystems. In freshwater ecosystems consumptive resistance was significantly stronger than competitive resistance and consumptive resistance appeared to be as strong in freshwater as in marine and terrestrial systems. The limited number of studies considering freshwater biotic resistance hindered our ability to understand the importance of factors including latitude, experimental duration, and method. However, the strength of biotic resistance varied among freshwater habitats; specifically, biotic resistance was strongest in lentic environments. Our analysis identifies mechanisms underlying biotic resistance in freshwater ecosystems that warrant further investigation given the potential ongoing and future impacts of invasive species in these systems.},

title={Forecasting the expansion of the invasive golden mussel Limnoperna fortunei in Brazilian and North American rivers based on its occurrence in the Paraguay River and Pantanal wetland of Brazil},
abstract={The bivalve Limnoperna fortunei (Dunker, 1857), also called golden mussel, is native to Asia but becoming dispersed around the world. The golden mussel resembles the invasive dreissenid bivalves in many respects, and although much less studied it evidently has broader environmental tolerances. The golden mussel was introduced into the La Plata River estuary (South America) and quickly expanded upstream to the north, into the tropical Paraguay River reaching a large floodplain area in Brazil known as the Pantanal wetland. The golden mussel tolerates environmental conditions in the Pantanal that would be inhospitable for most bivalves, but mussel mortality has been observed during the most extreme oxygen depletion events. Based on knowledge about the limiting factors for the golden mussel in the Pantanal wetland, its potential distribution was predicted for the remainder of the Paraguay River basin where the species is not present, as well as in other river systems throughout Brazil. Forecasts of potential distribution in Brazilian river systems were based on physicochemical limitations for shell calcification, and specifically on lower thresholds of dissolved calcium concentrations and the calcium carbonate (calcite) index of saturation, which may be a better indicator of calcification potential in low-calcium waters than calcium concentration alone. In addition to examining spatial patterns in calcium and calcification potential, these and other limnological and climate variables were used in ecological niche modeling using GARP and Maxent algorithms. Forecasts of potential distributions in three major North American river systems (Mississippi, Colorado, and Rio Grande) were based mainly on water temperature because calcium availability and calcification evidently would not be limiting to golden mussel establishment in those waters. Due to the greater tolerance of the golden mussel to conditions known to limit other bivalves, as well as its greater ability for shell calcification in low-calcium water, the golden mussel could potentially become broadly distributed throughout Brazil. According to its thermal tolerance L. fortunei could become established in the Mississippi, Colorado and Rio Grande drainage systems, although the northern Mississippi River system including the Missouri River may be too cool in the winter to support the golden mussel.},

title={Using maximum entropy to predict the potential distribution of an invasive freshwater snail},
abstract={1. Ecological niche modelling is a technique used to estimate potential distributions of invasive species based on available occurrence data and associated environmental conditions. Maximum entropy (Maxent) is a powerful method for ecological niche modelling and yet has only rarely been applied to aquatic species. 2. Here we applied Maxent to estimate the potential distribution of the invasive Chinese mystery snail (Cipangopaludina chinesis) in Wisconsin and analysed several methodological issues associated with using Maxent for lentic species. 3. To generate Maxent estimates of the potential distribution of C. chinesis, we used presence records from 292 lakes, five spatially explicit climatic variables, and two lake-specific environmental data sets (area, conductivity) from 7995 lakes. Our investigations included three aspects that could affect model prediction accuracy and transferability: (i) combining climate and lake variables into a single data set in two different ways, using each lake as a single observation and as a grid of 1 ha cells; (ii) varying the size of the background data set (locations without presences); and (iii) contrasting environmental conditions between locations with and without C. chinesis. 4. The lake-based model had higher accuracy than the grid-based model, although both models had accuracy values indicative of good performance. Conductivity and lake area were important predictor variables for both models, but had higher contribution to the lake-based model accuracy. Decreasing the background sample size minimally affected model accuracy and thus Maxent can be used even when background sampling does not meet the algorithm's default settings. Lastly, lakes that were environmentally dissimilar from lakes with known C. chinesis records were more likely to be predicted unsuitable by both grid-based and lake-based models. 5. Overall, the models predicted high potential suitability across Wisconsin lakes for C. chinesis, especially in lakes >= 60 ha. Our study provides evidence that small or environmentally biased presence data sets may underestimate the number of environmentally suitable locations of invasive species.},

title={The potential for using biological control technologies in the management of Dreissena spp.},
abstract={Broadly defined, biological control is the use of one species for the suppression of another. Two groups of organisms have potential as Dreissena control agents: selectively toxic microbes and natural enemies. Selectively toxic microbes are naturally occurring soil and water microorganisms that simply by chance happen to be toxic to Dreissena. Applied at artificially high densities to water, the microbial cells per se or their released metabolites are selectively lethal to Dreissena. In contrast, natural enemies are organisms that, by their evolutionary nature, will debilitate or kill Dreissena, including predators, parasites (both multicellular and microbial), and benthic competitors (organisms capable of competitively displacing Dreissena from substrates). Selectively Toxic Microbes: In the short run, these microorganisms represent the most promising candidates as biological control agents. The use of highly-specific, toxic microbes has a clear record of commercial success and environmental safety in the control of invertebrate pests in North America, and strains lethal to Dreissena have been already isolated. Considering how quickly a selectively toxic microbe could move from the laboratory to commercialization, continued research to develop this microbial control strategy is a high priority. Natural Enemies: In North America, as in Eurasia, there will likely be isolated field reports of major impacts by natural enemies, and, on the whole, we will likely see a cumulative effect of a complex of enemies having a constant, but limited, role in naturally suppressing Dreissena populations. In the majority of cases, Dreissena populations will cause economic and ecological effects at densities well below those that their enemies could naturally maintain. This does not mean, however, that certain natural enemies could not be artificially manipulated (e.g., mass produced and released in an inundative fashion) to cause major Dreissena reductions. 1. Parasites: These natural enemies would likely be the most environmentally-safe biocontrol agents, due primarily to their high host specificity. Comprehensive investigations to identify parasites that are strictly specific to Dreissena and that can be economically mass produced are a key research priority. Parasites from Dreissena's native Eurasian range should be studied to identify species that would be ``nearly risk free{''} candidates for importation into North America. Research to uncover parasites of Dreissena that are already present in North America should be intensified. 2. Predators: Although organisms, such as fish and birds, have sometimes been documented to consume Dreissena at high rates, this does nor necessarily mean that they would be effective candidates for use in control programs. Predators are typically not specific enough in their prey choices. A predator introduced to a waterbody from outside its natural range may highly prefer Dreissena as a prey item, but will also consume other aquatic organisms. The consumption of such nontarget prey could potentially have serious, adverse, ecological impacts. 3. Benthic Competitors: In addition to being micro/macrofouling organisms themselves, the lack of specificity of species that can competitively displace Dreissena from substrates (e.g., sponges) significantly reduces their potential as biocontrol agents.},

The lake was divided into three assessment units: the north lake, the south lake and a river section situated downstream of the two lake assessment units. Survey work was conducted as a single survey in September 2011. Following an evaluation of the mussel abundance and distribution range within each assessment unit, the Biological Pollution Level (BPL) was calculated. Additional environmental information was obtained from historical monitoring conducted by the Irish Environmental Protection Agency. The zebra mussel was rated as having a high abundance and distribution range in one lake assessment unit, was absent in the second lake assessment unit, and had a low abundance and distribution range for the river assessment unit. Ninety-three stations were surveyed in two and a half days illustrating a practical approach to monitoring which can meet legislative requirements.},

title={When will the zebra mussel reach Florence? A model for the spread of Dreissena polymorpha in the Arno water system (Italy)},
abstract={The zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) is a freshwater bivalve that has caused dramatic ecological and economic impacts worldwide in past decades. its success as ecosystem invader is mainly due to the species ability of spreading along rivers, together with the extremely high population densities that can be reached by local populations. Here we propose a spatially explicit model aimed at describing the population dynamics of mussel colonies in rivers represented as oriented graphs. We specifically apply the model to the Bilancino-Sieve-Arno water system (Tuscany, Italy), where D. polymorpha has been recently sighted. The model accounts for local-scale demographic processes and along-stream transport mechanisms. Because of the different temporal scales involved, we couple continuous- and discrete-time dynamics. Our model produces spatiotemporal scenarios of invasion that present several distinctive features of the zebra mussel invasion patterns observed in nature, including the spatial patchiness and the temporal irregularity of local populations, and the so-called domino effect. The application of our model to the Arno case study shows that D. polymorpha could severely threaten the city of Florence within a few years. Control measures aimed at limiting the impact of the species can significantly alter the ecological and environmental parameters. We find that such variations may profoundly impact spatiotemporal invasion patterns, possibly with counter-intuitive effects. For instance, reduced larval input from Lake Bilancino can in some cases produce higher mussel densities in downstream colonies. Therefore, the control of D. polymorpha must be planned with care in order to prevent unwelcome outcomes. Copyright (c) 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Preventing the introduction of an invasive species and managing the ecological and economic effects of successful invasions often rely on accurate predictions of the potential distribution of the species in its new habitat. Instances of failed invasion can highlight factors other than dispersal that limit range expansion in an invasive species. The commercially available waterways (CAWs) of the U.S. are a network of interconnected rivers that support a regular traffic of commercial and maintenance vessels. As such, they are at extremely high risk of infestation from Dreissena, yet not all the rivers are infested. We used traffic, water chemistry, and impoundment characteristics of the rivers in this system to develop a set of logistic-regression models to predict the occurrence of Dreissena. Four single variable models correctly classified 20 out of 24 (83\%) river systems. The best two-variable models had only one misclassified river, for an overall accuracy of 96\%. Among rivers to which Dreissena has successfully dispersed, permanent populations are most likely to establish in systems that have moderate ionic strength and that also have some impoundment areas to increase long-term population persistence. We use this hierarchy of factors to extend predictions to four systems that currently lack the high dispersal intensity of the CAWs.},

abstract={Aquatic invasive species are a growing concern to environmental managers because of their diverse impacts on aquatic biodiversity and high eradication costs, necessitating effective management policies. In this study, we evaluate the ability of environmental and socio-economic factors to predict the risk of invasion in Great Britain and Ireland of 12 potential aquatic invaders covering all major aquatic groups. Despite their potential to inform risk assessments, this is the first time socio-economic factors related to propagule pressure have been specifically integrated in distribution modelling. Species distribution models (SDM, MaxEnt algorithm) were calibrated with a set of environmental factors (e.g. bioclimatic, geographical and geological) and integrated with socio-economic (e.g. human influence index, population density, closeness to ports) predictors. The inclusion of socio-economic factors in SDM did not affect accuracy scores (AUC already >0 center dot 90), but their effects were more pronounced in spatial predictions, resulting in up to a sixfold amplification of the area predicted suitable for each species. Despite the inclusion of potential surrogates of water chemistry (e.g. geology) and propagule pressure (e.g. population density), temperature-related variables were most important predictors of aquatic species' distributions. According to SDM, the environmental suitability for a suite of invaders belonging to different taxonomic groups and regions of origin is greatest in east and south-east England and decreases towards the north and west. Multiple invasions in this region are of special concern, as species are known to modify their habitat facilitating subsequent invasions, thereby potentially exacerbating their impacts. Major management regions to be prioritized in monitoring programmes include the Humber, Thames and Anglian River Basin Districts. Species of special concern include a mysid (Hemimysis anomala), a gammarid (Dikerogammarus villosus), a plant (Ludwigia grandiflora) and two crayfishes (Procambarus clarkii and P.fallax). Synthesis and Applications. The inclusion of socio-economic factors in species distribution models has the potential to improve predictions of areas under a highest risk of multiple invasions and to help disentangle the complex interplay between biological invasions and global environmental and socio-economic processes. Such understanding is pivotal to prioritize limited resources for the optimum prevention and control of biological invasions.},

Our aim was to check the suitability of selected alien species (the snail Physa acuta, the bivalve Dreissena polymorpha, and the gammarid Dikerogammarus villosus) as diluents for infectious bird schistosome cercariae-the etiological factor of swimmer's itch. It has been hypothesized that alien species with different feeding habits (scrapers, filterers and predators) that cohabit the aquatic environment with intermediate hosts of the schistosomatid trematodes are capable of feeding on their free-swimming stages-cercariae. In the laboratory conditions used, all experimental animals diluted the cercariae of bird schistosome. The most effective diluents were P. acuta and D. villosus. However, a wide discrepancy in the dilution of the cercariae between replicates was found for gammarids. The obtained results confirm the hypothesis that increased biodiversity, even when alien species are involved, creates the dilution effect of the free-living stages of parasites. Determining the best diluent for bird schistosome cercariae could greatly assist in the development of current bathing areas protection measures against swimmer's itch.},

abstract={This paper reviews published knowledge on how to deal with invasive species during biological quality assessments in European river systems for water management and assessments of ecological quality required, for example, by the European Water Frame Work Directive. The papers studied included international papers and some standards for water assessment. An overview of the current state of neozoa research showed that many different topics are treated, comprising biogeography and fauna records, species replacements and effectiveness of colonisation, life cycles, competition between native and invasive species, habitat quality and pathways of migration. Additionally, some papers have been published recently on the integration of neozoa in index-based assessment systems. Although the decline or increase of alien species populations and the corresponding impacts on indigenous populations were frequently observed, the mechanisms behind the invasions often remain hypothetical. In the reviewed papers, issues such as possible reasons for coexistence, tolerances, quality of habitat or water, life history traits and introduction of diseases were rarely covered. Few neozoa are sufficiently investigated to be categorised as indicators. After discussing the advantages and disadvantages of inclusion or exclusion, inclusion of invaders in assessments of both biodiversity (all species) and human impact (only species classified in their specific tolerance) is suggested. Further research is required to (1) update and assign ecological profiles of the non-indigenous species currently and (2) assess the effects of new invaders on native communities.},

title={Can filter-feeding Asian carp invade the Laurentian Great Lakes? A bioenergetic modelling exercise},
abstract={P>1. There is much concern that filter-feeding Asian carp will invade the Laurentian Great Lakes and deplete crucial plankton resources. We developed bioenergetic models, using parameters from Asian carp and other fish species, to explore the possibility that planktonic food resources are insufficient to support the growth of silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and bighead carp (H. nobilis) in the Great Lakes. 2. The models estimated basic metabolic requirements of silver and bighead carp under various body sizes, swimming speeds and reproductive stages. These requirements were then related to planktonic food resources and environmental temperature to predict when and where silver and bighead carp may survive in the Great Lakes, and how far they may travel. 3. Parameter values for respiration functions were derived experimentally in a coordinated study of silver and bighead carp, while consumption parameters were obtained from the literature on silver carp. Other model parameters lacking for Asian carp, such as those for egestion and excretion, were obtained from the literature on other fish species. 4. We found that full-sized bighead carp required 61.0 kJ d-1 just to maintain their body mass at 20 degrees C, approximately equivalent to feeding in a region with 255 mu g L-1 macrozooplankton (dry) or 10.43 mu g L-1 chlorophyll a. Silver carp energy requirements were slightly higher. 5. When applied to various habitats in the Great Lakes, our results suggest that silver and bighead carp will be unable to colonise most open-water regions because of limited plankton availability. However, in some circumstances, carp metabolism at lower temperatures may be low enough to permit positive growth even at very low rations. Positive growth is even more likely in productive embayments and wetlands, and the modelled swimming costs in some of these habitats suggest that carp could travel > 1 km d-1 without losing biomass. 6. The simulation (and firmly hypothetical) results from this modelling study suggest when and where Asian carp could become established in the Great Lakes. Given the potential consequences to Great Lakes ecosystems if these filter feeders do prove capable of establishing reproducing populations, efforts to keep Asian carp out of the Great Lakes must not be lessened. However, we do encourage the use of bioenergetic modelling in a holistic approach to assessing the risk of Asian carp invasion in the Great Lakes region.},

DNA from zebra mussels was log concentration-dependent from 1 to 1 x 10(6) pM, reaching a detection limit of 2.0 pM. In site tests were also successfully applied to real samples, within less than 45 min, using DNA extracted from zebra mussel meat. The plasmonic nanosensors' signal can be used as a binary output (yes/no) to assess the presence of those invasive species. Even though these genosensors were applied to the monitoring of DNA in environmental samples, they potentially offer advantage in a wide range of fields, such as disease diagnostics.},

title={Development and characterization of 29 microsatellite markers for Ligumia nasuta (Bivalvia: Unionidae) using an Illumina sequencing approach},
abstract={Ligumia nasuta (Say, 1817; Eastern Pondmussel) is an imperiled freshwater mussel (Unionidae) in eastern North America. Population declines in the Laurentian Great Lakes resulting from the introduction of dreissenid mussels and habitat destruction in the 20th Century have greatly reduced and limited its distribution. To properly inform restoration and management efforts for L. nasuta, fine-scale genetic analyses must be performed on the remnant populations. This study used Illumina paired-end shotgun sequencing to identify potential microsatellite loci for L. nasuta, utilizing two samples to develop the Illumina paired-end shotgun library. Forty-eight primer pairs were tested on the remaining 24 samples. Twenty-nine of the 48 microsatellite primer sets screened were successfully amplified using 24 L nasuta samples collected from the Great Lakes watershed. The estimated fragment size ranged from 167 to 445 base-pairs (bp) and the number of alleles per locus varied between 5 and 16 (mean = 9.7). Only five of the loci deviated significantly from Hardy-Weinberg expectations after Bonferroni corrections. The development of these new microsatellite loci will greatly facilitate future genetic studies on L nasuta. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

title={Development of a Physically Based Sediment Transport Model for Green Bay, Lake Michigan},
abstract={Green Bay is the largest freshwater estuarine system on earth, drains one-third of the Lake Michigan basin and delivers one-third of the lake's phosphorus load. Southern Green Bay is a designated area of concern due to ecosystem degradation that includes eutrophication, harmful algal blooms, hypoxia, lost or altered habitat, and reduced water quality. While marine estuaries are subject to tidal influence and saltwater intrusion, this freshwater estuary is subject to lake intrusion of freshwater with different quality parameters. Understanding the simultaneous effects of tributary flows and lake intrusions is crucial to comprehend the dynamics of freshwater estuaries. A single hydrodynamic, wind-wave, and sediment transport model was developed for the lake and its estuary. This approach provides fine resolution in the estuary and simulates directly the combined effects of tributary flows and lake intrusions. The approach overcomes open-boundary limitations of nested models, and of whole-lake models that lack sufficient resolution or wind-wave and sediment transport simulation. The model confirms findings of previous studies and demonstrates how the circulation, thermal regime, wave action, and sediment transport in the estuary depend on meteorological forcing, tributary flows, and lake intrusions. The stage is set to apply this approach to study biogeochemical processes in lakes and estuaries.},

title={Application of bioclimatic models coupled with network analysis for risk assessment of the killer shrimp, Dikerogammarus villosus, in Great Britain},
abstract={In this study we use a combination of techniques to assess the general risk of invasion by the aquatic invader Dikerogammarus villosus in Great Britain at multiple scales. First, bioclimatic models (Support Vector Machine algorithm) were used to identify regions showing the highest climatic match with the European range of the species, and that might be at highest risk of initial colonization if provided with propagules. The model showed that nearly 60\% of Great Britain shows the minimum bioclimatic suitability for the species, particularly southern and eastern England. Afterwards, a Network Analysis was used to model the natural spatio-temporal spread of the killer shrimp in the Great Ouse River catchment (SE England), the first region invaded by this species. This model suggested that the northern part of the catchment, including two relevant Ramsar sites (Ouse Washes and Wicken fen) are at serious risk of being invaded in the short-term (<5 years). Taking into account the rapid spread of the killer shrimp in other European countries, its broad environmental tolerance, the high climate suitability of broad areas of Great Britain to the species, the current spread of other Ponto-Caspian species, and the high natural and artificial connectivity of the hydrological network, we conclude that D. villosus is very likely to continue its spread in Great Britain, dramatically affecting the native biodiversity. The multi-scale approach proposed in this study combines large-scale bioclimatic models with local-scale dispersal models, providing managers with a powerful spatial and temporal basis for informed decision-making.},

title={Assessing the influence of different inland lake management strategies on human-mediated invasive species spread},
abstract={Species introduced to the Great Lakes region through shipping, pet and nursery trade, and as biological control have caused significant environmental damages and have increased the direct and indirect costs to boat owners and various water-dependent industries. Once established, recreational boating becomes the primary vector of spread for some of these species, such as zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha Pallas, 1771). Prevention and mitigation efforts in the past have focused on boater education, boat washing stations, and inspections; yet these management actions can be expensive with limited or largely unknown effectiveness. In this study, we used a gravity model framework to accurately simulate the spread of an aquatic invasive species. After parameterization, the constructed model effectively simulated the human-mediated movements of the historical dreissenid spread patterns, correctly predicting an average accuracy of 78.2\% (standard deviation = 0.01\%) lakes invaded per model run. We then used the model to determine the effectiveness of three different invasive species management scenarios in Michigan: deterring boaters from lakes with a high likelihood of invasion, targeted education at high-risk lakes, and a large-scale education effort. Results indicated that deterring boaters from high-risk lakes is effective in the first five years of an invasion, targeted education is more effective at late stages of an invasion, and large-scale education is effective at all stages of an invasion. Our results indicate that managers should be flexible in their management actions and that different strategies are likely more effective at different stages of an invasion.},

title={Risk and decision methods applied to aquatic ecosystem management},
abstract={Increased global trade and modern intercontinental transportation have made invasive species an increasingly prominent stressor of freshwater ecosystems. Invasive species risk assessments, which range from simple screening protocols that focus on species attributes and ecological requirements to rigorous analyses of infestation, have become an important component of environmental impact assessment. In this paper we present two recent case studies in which risk and decision methods were applied to non-toxicological environmental issues that are central to many aquatic ecosystem management programs. The first example reviews potential infestation by the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, on Bayou Bartholomew, located in southeast Arkansas, as a result of the proposed augmentation of low flow conditions by pumping water from the nearby and much larger Arkansas River. The second example presents a retrospective analysis of the results of transplanting fat pocketbook pearly mussels, Potarnilus capax, from an approximately 6-km reach of a drainage ditch in eastern Arkansas. The two examples presented herein indicate the potential for improving environmental decision-making in the face of uncertainty-but in the presence of substantial information. As more rigorous attempts are made to widen and enhance applications of risk and decision methods to environmental decision-making, ecosystem management is likely to further improve.},

title={Faster monitoring of the invasive alien species (IAS) Dreissena polymorpha in river basins through isothermal amplification},
abstract={Zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) is considered as one of the 100 most harmful IAS in the world. Traditional detection methods have limitations, and PCR based environmental DNA detection has provided interesting results for early warning. However, in the last years, the development of isothermal amplification methods has received increasing attention. Among them, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has several advantages, including its higher tolerance to the presence of inhibitors and the possibility of naked-eye detection, which enables and simplifies its potential use in decentralized settings. In the current study, a real-time LAMP (qLAMP) method for the detection of Dreissena polymorpha was developed and tested with samples from the Guadalquivir River basin, together with two real-time PCR (qPCR) methods using different detection chemistries, targeting a specific region of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome C oxidase subunit I. All three developed approaches were evaluated regarding specificity, sensitivity and time required for detection. Regarding sensitivity, both qPCR approaches were more sensitive than qLAMP by one order of magnitude, however the qLAMP method proved to be as specific and much faster being performed in just 9 min versus 23 and 29 min for the qPCR methods based on hydrolysis probe and intercalating dye respectively.},

title={Strong body mass decrease of the invasive clam Corbicula fluminea during summer},
abstract={The filter-feeding clam Corbicula fluminea has widely spread from its Asiatic origin into freshwater habitats on several continents, where it often has a considerable impact on ecosystem processes. The present study was stimulated by the observation that C. fluminea can experience mass mortality during warm summers, even when temperatures are still far below the lethal level. We hypothesized that starvation due to low food quantities during summer is a main factor in this context. In order to test nutritional conditions in an environment where summer mortality occurred, the clams' body mass was tracked in river bypass systems installed at the Lower River Rhine (Germany and The Netherlands). Two food levels were adjusted in the bypass channels: one corresponding to the original chlorophyll level in the river (ambient food) and one with a chlorophyll a level reduced by about 50\% (low food). The clams kept at the ambient food level increased their shell length during summer, although growth rates decreased at low food levels in the River Rhine in late summer. In contrast to shell length, body mass decrease in late summer cumulated in 94\% reduction from August until October. This trend was enhanced by the experimental food reduction, i.e., clams kept in the low food level treatments weighed 60\% less than the clams in the ambient food treatment at the end of summer. However, mortality was low in both treatments. The data demonstrate a high plasticity in the body mass of C. fluminea. The corresponding possibility to respire body mass can be seen as one strategy to survive longer starvation periods.},

abstract={Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha), first reported in Texas during 2009, have infested 28 Texas reservoirs over 11 years. This species has not previously invaded water bodies as warm as those in Texas, where temperatures approach or exceed its previously accepted incipient upper thermal limit of 30 degrees C, raising the question of how such temperatures impact its population dynamics. Over 3-5 years, monthly collections of mussels, sampling for planktonic mussel veligers, juvenile settlement data, and water quality parameters, were undertaken at Texas lakes Texoma, Ray Roberts, and Belton to estimate mussel shell length growth rates, life spans, reproductive periods, and settlement patterns. Biannual spawning periods occurred at water temperatures of 18 to 28 degrees C, resulting in distinct spring and fall juvenile settlement cohorts. Growth rates were rapid, with both cohorts attaining mean maximum shell lengths of 20-25 mm within 8-15 months of settlement, compared to European and northeastern US populations that attained similar sizes after 2-4 years. Shortened life spans were demarcated by adult mussel die-offs during summer months of elevated water temperature the year after initial settlement, leading to short-term cyclical fluctuations in population densities. Large-scale mussel die-offs were caused by flooding and hypoxia events. Elevated temperatures appeared to facilitate mussel invasiveness by increasing spawning frequency and elevating growth rates, thus reducing time to maturity and allowing population recovery within 1-2 years after environmentally induced severe population declines.},

title={Limited Co- existence of Native Unionids and Invasive Dreissenid Mussels more than 30 Y Post Dreissenid Invasion in a Large River System},
abstract={There are serious concerns for native freshwater mussel survival (Bivalvia: Unionidae) in the Laurentian Great Lakes region after populations were seemingly pushed to the brink of extirpation following the introduction of dreissenid mussels (D.reissena polymorpha and D. rostriformis bugensis) in the mid-1980s. The Detroit River was the first major river system in North America to be invaded by dreissenids, and unionids were considered extirpated from the river by 1998. Since then several unionid refuges (areas with relatively low dreissenid impact and surviving unionids) have been found in coastal areas of lakes St. Clair and Erie, but no documentation exists in the Detroit River. To assess dreissenid presence and potential unionid persistence, a mixture of stratified random, historical, and potential refuge sites were surveyed during summer 2019 in the Detroit River. Unionid and dreissenid habitat use was further investigated with analysis of variance and classification tree analyses. Of the 56 sites surveyed, only five sites had live unionids totaling 220 animals of 11 species. More than 2000 unionid shells of 31 species were collected from 39 sites, confirming the large and diverse unionid populations that existed prior to the dreissenid invasion. Ninety-eight percent of live unionids found showed evidence of past or present dreissenid attachment. Estimated dreissenid densities were highly variable with river location and ranged from 0 to 5673 live individuals per m(2), with the largest densities concentrated in the upstream half of the Detroit River. Despite their previously assumed extirpation from the Detroit River, live unionids wei found during this comprehensive survey. Although only 40\% of the historical species within the unionid assemblage remains, our results suggest, in the right conditions, some co-existence is possible among some species of unionids and dreissenids in this large river system.},

abstract={Predators shape the behavior and distribution of prey organisms, driving their evolution and environmental impact. We studied relationships between interspecific competition and predation risk in Ponto-Caspian invasive gammarid crustaceans: Pontogammarus robustoides and Dikerogammarus villosus. We hypothesized that a stronger competitor D. villosus would displace P. robustoides from a preferred habitat, but the frequency of this displacement would be reduced in the presence of a higher fish predator, the racer goby. We studied gammarid preferences for stone or sand substrata in 24-h pairwise-choice tests in single-species or mixed-species treatments, at 2 densities (12 or 24 individuals per tank), in the presence or absence of a predator. D. villosus displaced P. robustoides from the stone habitat, even at the low density. As P. robustoides tested separately preferred stones at both densities, its displacement resulted from active avoidance of a stronger competitor even when the substratum was not actually a limited resource. The presence of a predator reduced the number of instances of displacement of P. robustoides by D. villosus, allowing the weaker species to stay on its preferred substratum. Nevertheless, the presence of D. villosus still increased fish predation on P. robustoides. The presence of a predator modifies relationships between prey organisms, allowing a weaker competitor to stay in its preferred habitat. Thus, anti-predator responses of prey organisms may have cascading effects on the functioning of the community, affecting habitat choice and competition among species.},

abstract={The freshwater mussel Limnoperna fortunei is adapted to colonize a wide range of aquatic environments, and its ability to contend with environmental stress through phenotypic plasticity has allowed this species to successfully colonize and become established in new regions. Only limited information is currently available on the wide intraspecific variability of this species in response to environmental heterogeneity. Here, we tested the hypotheses that (1) growth and body weight of mussels from a highly polluted environment differed from those from a less polluted habitat, and (2) growth parameters estimated in this study differed from those reported for other invaded ecosystems. We conducted controlled field experiments in two study sites with differing levels of pollution. To compare our results to those reported elsewhere, we considered growth data from studies performed in different locations. We found that mussels from the more polluted habitat showed lower shell growth and body weight than those from the less polluted environment. We also observed differences in the growth performances of the golden mussel between our estimates and those from other invaded habitats. Our findings provide useful information to better understand the striking intraspecific variability of this species in response to stressful conditions. Knowledge on the phenotypic plasticity of Limnoperna fortunei is essential for predicting and managing this species.},

abstract={The accidental spread of aquatic invasive species (AIS) by recreational boaters is a major concern of state and county environmental planners in the USA. While programs for watercraft inspection to educate boaters and slow AIS spread are common practice, large numbers of boats and waterbodies, together with limited budgets, make program design difficult. To facilitate program design, we developed an integer programming model for allocation of scarce inspection resources among lakes. Our model uses species-specific infestation status of lakes and estimates of boat movement between lakes. The objective is to select lakes for inspection stations to maximize the number of risky boats inspected, where risky boats are ones that move from infested to uninfested lakes. We apply our model in Stearns County in central Minnesota, USA, to prioritize lakes for inspection stations and evaluate alternative management objectives. With an objective of protecting uninfested lakes within and outside Stearns County, the optimal policy is to locate stations at infested lakes having the most boats departing for uninfested lakes inside and outside the county. With an objective of protecting only Stearns County lakes, the optimal policy is to locate stations at both infested and uninfested lakes having the riskiest boats arriving from within and outside the county and departing to in-county lakes. The tradeoff between these objectives is significant.},

In this study, we assessed if environmental DNA (eDNA) can extend the seasonal window for dreissenid mussel early detection beyond that of plankton tows, which are limited to warmer seasons when mussel larvae are present. We focused eDNA sampling efforts at multiple sites in Tiber Reservoir (Montana) where dreissenid mussel abundance is hypothesized to be low. Samples were collected in June and October 2017, when water temperatures were cooler than thermal optima for dreissenid reproduction. and in July 2017 when water temperatures were wanner and conducive for reproduction. We detected dreissenid mussel DNA in June, July and October even though no dreissenid mussels were observed using non-molecular tools in 2017. A subset of positive and negative eDNA samples was analyzed by an independent lab and results were corroborated. We then estimated the effort needed for 95\% probability detection of dreissenid DNA at each site within Tiber Reservoir and found that as many as 27, 14, and 34 samples needed to be collected in June. July and October, respectively. To further validate the utility of eDNA. we also present ancillary eDNA results from other waters in the Flathead Reservation (Montana) where dreissenid mussels have never been detected and from waters with established zebra mussel populations in the upper Mississippi River. which were sampled in the spring when water temperatures were cooler than thermal optima for dreissenid reproduction. All Flathead Reservation samples were negative for dreissenid mussel DNA, while all upper Mississippi River samples were positive. This study adds to a growing body of research that demonstrates eDNA is a highly sensitive tool for dreissenid mussel surveillance in newly invaded waters, including colder seasons when non-molecular tools are likely to be less effective or more challenging to employ.},

title={The role of host specificity in explaining the invasion success of the freshwater mussel Anodonta woodiana in Europe},
abstract={Several freshwater mussel species represent some of the most problematic invasive species and have considerably altered ecosystems worldwide. Their invasion potential has been partially attributed to their free-living larvae, which have a high dispersal capability. We investigated the invasion potential of Anodonta (Sinanodonta) woodiana, a species of East Asian unionid mussel established worldwide despite having an obligatory parasitic stage (glochidium), which must encyst on host fish. The invasion success of A. woodiana has been attributed to the success of worldwide introductions of its sympatric fish hosts. We experimentally found, however, that A. woodiana is a broad host generalist, which can complete its development on all eight fish species tested, both coinvasive and native. Subsequently, we used a data on the occurrence and relative abundance of potential hosts in river habitats in the Czech Republic to project scenarios of the effect of host availability on A. woodiana invasion. We found that host availability does not constitute a major limit for A. woodiana to colonise most aquatic habitats in Central Europe. In addition, we investigated seasonal dynamics of A. woodiana reproduction and did not detect any limitations of its reproduction by ambient water temperatures typical of a Central European lowland river. Consequently, we predict that A. woodiana may further increase the speed and range of its invasion and we discuss possible consequences to native habitats and communities, especially to the endangered species of unionid mussels.},

abstract={Following the introduction of automobile catalysts in the middle of the 1980s in Germany there is an increasing emission of the platinum-group-metals platinum, palladium (Pd) and rhodium. Still, it remains unclear if these metals are bioavailable for aquatic animals and to which extent they become accumulated by the aquatic biosphere. Because of analytical problems in detecting Pd in small biological samples the present investigation concentrates on the bioavailability of this metal. To answer the question of a Pd uptake by aquatic organisms experimental studies were conducted with European eels maintained in water containing road dust at a concentration of 10 kg/100 l. Following an exposure period of four weeks, samples of liver and kidney were analysed by total-reflection X-ray fluorescence analysis after co-precipitation of Pd with mercury. These experiments revealed an uptake of traffic related Pd by European eels which showed a mean liver Pd concentration of 0.18 +/-0.05 ng/g (wet wt.), whereas the Pd concentration in the kidney ranged below the detection limit. Thus, in this study we can demonstrate for the first time that automobile catalyst emitted Pd is bioavailable for aquatic animals. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

title={A review of ballast water management practices and challenges in harsh and arctic environments},
abstract={Ballast water is carried by cruise ships, large tankers, and bulk cargo carriers to acquire the optimum operating depth of the propeller and to maintain maneuverability and stability. Recently, ballast water has been recognized as wastewater that is responsible for ocean pollution due to the worldwide transfer of non-indigenous species, pathogenic bacteria, and other pollutants via ballast water discharge. This poses serious environmental, ecological, and economic threats to both coastal communities and the marine environment. To address these negative impacts and concerns, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has codified and adopted a series of guidelines to minimize pollution and adverse effects caused by ballast water. A number of treatment technologies have been developed and applied in field practices to remove solids, particulates, organic pollutants, and organisms from ballast water, showing certain advantages and limitations. Many other management practices, such as ballast water exchange (BWE), shipping routes optimization, treatment process modeling, and risk assessment are in high demand to aid onboard treatment systems. However, knowledge and technical gaps still exist regarding the implementation of ballast water management practices especially in the context of arctic and harsh environments under changing climatic conditions. Records indicate that most coastal regions in the north have been invaded by unwanted species via ballast water discharge in the past decades. The North Atlantic and the Arctic Oceans have much colder climates and more extreme weather conditions than low latitudes. The discharge of untreated or less treated ballast water could cause much more severe damage to the local environment and hence pose higher risks to ecosystems and even human health, particularly in the context of climate change. Based on a comprehensive literature review, this study proposed a risk-based fuzzy-stochastic-interval programming decision support system to help eliminate environmental, ecological, as well as health threats from the discharge of ballast water, particularly in the north where weather, space, timing, maintenance, and cost are major concerns.},

abstract={The sub-tropical mussel Mytella charruana has been reported as invasive along the southeast coast of the USA since 1986. This mussel has been found to negatively impact the keystone species in its invaded range, the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica. To date, however, no mechanism for this negative impact has been determined. To elucidate the role of the invasive mussel on economically important oyster reefs, we compared the feeding of both species in a lagoon along the east coast of Florida (USA). Three different methodologies were used: (1) in situ filter-feeding experiments using the biodeposition method to estimate feeding behavior; (2) laboratory assays to estimate the depletion of bacterial particles using a flow cytometer; and (3) stable isotope analysis in conjunction with ellipse-based metrics to investigate the niche size and overlap of these 2 species. The in situ filter-feeding experiments revealed that, compared to C. virginica, M. charruana had significantly higher clearance, filtration, rejection, organic ingestion, and ab sorption rates, as well as higher rejection percentage and absorption efficiency, but rejected the same amount of inorganic particles. Flow cytometry data suggested that bacteria were a food source for both bivalve species. Stable isotope values confirmed that M. charruana and C. virginica filled similar functional niches in this ecosystem. These results suggest that M. charruana can out-compete native oysters; the findings also demonstrate that an invasion of M. charruana might significantly alter plankton abundance, potentially limiting food sources available to other less efficient native filter-feeders such as clams.},

abstract={The ecosystem of the Naroch Lakes (Belarus) includes three water bodies, Lake Batorino, Lake Myastro and Lake Naroch. These lakes have a common catchment area. At the end of the 80 s, the ecosystem of the Naroch Lakes underwent a transformation, during which the nutrient load on the catchment area decreased, and the concentration of phosphorus as a limiting factor in these water bodies decreased significantly. At the same time, the Naroch Lakes were exposed to zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha Pallas) invasion. In the mid-90 s, the biological and hydrochemical characteristics of the ecosystem of the Naroch Lakes stabilized. We show here that complex processes associated with the transformation of the lake ecosystem and affecting both trophic interactions in the Naroch Lakes and the influence of environmental factors on them can be represented using a single parameter, the phase-locking index, PLI. In this case, a statistically significant numerical value of PLI characterizes the phase synchronization of two processes, oscillations of the concentration of total phosphorus, TP, and oscillations of the concentration of chlorophyll, Chl. We show that the phase synchronization of these processes occurs only after the stabilization of the ecosystem of the Naroch Lakes. In the period preceding the transformation of the lake ecosystem, there was no synchronization. Numerical evaluation of PLI as a holistic parameter allows us to characterize the transformation of the lake ecosystem as a whole without resorting to study of complex interactions of various factors involved in this transformation.},

abstract={Tolerance towards environmental stress has been frequently considered as one of the key determinants of invasion success. However, empirical evidence supporting the assumption that invasive species can better endure unfavorable conditions compared with native species is limited and has yielded opposing results. In this study, we examined the tolerance to different stress conditions (thermal stress and trace metal zinc pollution stress) in two phylogenetically related and functionally similar freshwater bivalve species, the native Anodonta anatina and the invasive Sinanodonta woodiana. We assessed potential differences in response to stress conditions using several cellular response assays: efficiency of the multixenobiotic resistance mechanism, respiration estimate (INT reduction capacity), and enzymatic biomarkers. Our results demonstrated that the invasive species overall coped much better with unfavorable conditions. The higher tolerance of S. woodiana was evident from (i) significantly decreased Rhodamine B accumulation indicating more efficient multixenobiotic resistance mechanism; (ii) significantly higher INT reduction capacity and (iii) less pronounced alterations in the activity of stress-related enzymes (glutathione-S-transferase, catalase) and of a neurotoxicity biomarker (cholinesterase) in the majority of treatment conditions in both stress trials. Higher tolerance to thermal extremes may provide physiological benefit for further invasion success of S. woodiana in European freshwaters, especially in the context of climate change.

Stomach contents of 120 specimens attached to the roots of Eichhornia crassipes, and available planktonic food sources, taken from seven representative environments of the Parana River floodplain, were analyzed. The diet consisted of 156 taxa with a wide size range (2-1,178 mu m) and representing a great variety of organisms. Phytoplankton was dominant in abundance (98.6\% of the total diet), while zooplankton, mainly small cladocerans, was dominant in volume (67\% of the total diet). L. fortunei showed a positive food selectivity for organisms with limited escape ability and low to moderate size (Euglenophyta, Rotifera, Chydoridae and Bosminidae), and a negative selectivity for many algae. Therefore, the plankton community structure would be changed due to this differential predation pressure. These are the first observations about the feeding of L. fortunei upon zooplankton. The results of the present study agree, in general, with those of descriptive field studies and laboratory experiments on the effect of Dreissena polymorpha on zooplankton, but differ in some aspects. The differences suggest the possibility of different impacts on the ecosystem, and a probable complementary coexistence in potentially `invadable' environments. Ecological interaction between L. fortunei and the invasive hydrophyte Eichhornia crassipes suggests a possible synergistic effect on the distributional efficiency of the mollusk.},

title={Can a Rapid Underwater Video Approach Enhance the Benthic Assessment Capability of the National Coastal Condition Assessment in the Great Lakes?},
abstract={Over 400 sites were sampled in the nearshore of the U.S. Great Lakes during the U.S. National Coastal Condition Assessment (NCCA) field survey in summer 2010. Underwater video images were recorded in addition to routine NCCA benthic assessment measures. This paper has two objectives: (1) to develop a process to evaluate video performance with acceptance criteria, exploring reasons for poor images, and (2) to use acceptable videos in an example application with invasive mussels, evaluating the enhancement potential of video to supplement traditional grab sampling. A standard hierarchical protocol was developed to rank video performance based on quality and clarity. We determined controllable and uncontrollable factors affecting video performance. Moreover, specific thresholds limiting video were identified: > 0.5/m for light extinction and > 3.5 A mu g/L for chlorophyll a concentration. To demonstrate the utility and enhancement potential of video sampling, observed dreissenid presence from excellent (221 of 362 videos) videos was compared with NCCA benthic taxonomy, in the context of the statistically based NCCA survey. Including video increased the overall area estimate of the U.S. Great Lakes nearshore with invasive mussels by about 15 \% compared to PONAR alone; 44 \% (7570 km(2)) of the surveyed region had mussels. The proportion of the nearshore area having mussels varied from low (3.5 \%) in Lake Superior to > 50 \% in the lower lakes. PONAR and video have unique strengths and weaknesses as sampling tools in the Great Lakes nearshore environment, but when paired were complimentary and thus provided a more thorough benthic condition assessment at lake and regional scales.},

title={Abiotic factors controlling the establishment and abundance of the invasive golden mussel Limnoperna fortunei},
abstract={Limnoperna fortunei (Bivalvia, Mytilidae), a freshwater bivalve native to Southern Asia, has been an invasive species in South America since 1991. It spread upstream in the La Plata basin reaching the Paraguay River in the vicinity of the Pantanal wetland, Brazil, around 1998. The role of abiotic factors in controlling establishment and abundance of this species is not well known, making projections of its risk of further spread difficult. This study evaluates the importance of abiotic factors to L. fortunei populations established in rivers of the Pantanal, focusing on larval and juvenile densities and taking advantage of a wide range of seasonal variability in water temperature, flow, dissolved oxygen, and suspended material. Temperature, river stage (influencing several water characteristics) and water velocity are the main variables related to the larval and juvenile densities. In the Pantanal, environmental variables vary over a broader range compared with other South American locations, subjecting L. fortunei to oxygen depletion, low calcium, low pH, and high water velocity and suspended solids, associated with low chlorophyll a concentrations. The combined effect of several of these conditions may explain the relatively low densities in some Pantanal sites. However, they probably will not prevent the persistence of populations in the Pantanal and the eventual establishment of viable populations in upriver systems connected to the Pantanal. These results are pertinent not only to this species but also to other aquatic invasive invertebrates whose expansion may be limited by thermal extremes, episodic oxygen depletion, and waters that are too dilute or acidic for optimal biocalcification.},

title={Autochthonous or allochthonous resources determine the characteristic population dynamics of ecosystem engineers and their impacts},
abstract={Ecosystem engineering, or the modification of physical environments by organisms, can influence trophic interactions and thus food web dynamics. Although existing theory exclusively considers engineers using autochthonous resources, many empirical studies show that they often depend on allochthonous resources. By developing a simple mathematical model involving an ecosystem engineer that modifies the physical environment through its activities, its resource, and physical environment modified by the engineer, we compare the effects of autochthonous and allochthonous resources on the dynamics and stability of community with ecosystem engineers. To represent a variety of real situations, we consider engineers that alter either resource productivity, engineer feeding rate on the resource, or engineer mortality, and incorporate time-lagged responses of the physical environment. Our model shows that the effects of ecosystem engineering on community dynamics depend greatly on resource types. When the engineer consumes autochthonous resources, the community can exhibit oscillatory dynamics if the engineered environment affects engineer's feeding rate or mortality. These cyclic behaviors are, however, stabilized by a slowly responding physical environment. When allochthonous resources are supplied as donor-controlled, on the other hand, the engineer population is unlikely to oscillate but instead can undergo unbounded growth if the engineered environment affects resource productivity or engineer mortality. This finding suggests that ecosystem engineers utilizing allochthonous resources may be more likely to reach high abundance and cause strong impacts on ecosystems. Our results highlight that community-based, compounding effects of trophic and physical biotic interactions of ecosystem engineers depend crucially on whether the engineers utilize autochthonous or allochthonous resources.},

abstract={We studied diet, growth and reproductive biology of round goby Neogobius melanostomus from the Kiel Canal, northern Germany, to give an insight into the life cycle of this species in a brackish water canal. Crustaceans had the highest importance in the diet of all examined size classes of round goby. Other major food taxa were annelids and chironomids. Mussels and fish were consumed almost exclusively by medium- and large-sized N. melanostomus and contributed to the diet to a minor extent. In addition to the variability between size classes, we found a high interannual variability in the prey species. Round goby in the Kiel Canal was characterised by relatively low asymptotic total length and high relative fecundity. An almost balanced sex ratio indicates the established status of the population. The highest spawning activity took place between May and the end of June. From our data, negative effects of round goby on native species due to competition for prey and habitat are more likely than due to direct predation on eggs or fry. Affected species with similar habitat requirements are for example small gobiids from the genus Pomatoschistus. As round goby occurs in high abundance, substantial changes of the Kiel Canal ecosystem seem possible and likely.},

title={Long-term trends in trait structure of riverine communities facing predation risk increase and trophic resource decline},
abstract={Many large European rivers have undergone multiple pressures that have strongly impaired ecosystem functioning at different spatial and temporal scales. Global warming and other environmental changes have favored the success of invasive species, deeply modifying the structure of aquatic communities in large rivers. Some exogenous species could alter trophic interactions within assemblages by increasing the predation risk for potential prey species (top-down effect) and limiting the dynamics of others via resource availability limitation (bottom-up effect). Furthermore, large transboundary rivers are complex aquatic ecosystems that have often been poorly investigated so that data for assessing long-term ecological trends are missing. In this study, we propose an original approach for investigating long-term combined effects of global warming, trophic resource decrease, predation risk, and water quality variations on the trait-based structure of macroinvertebrate and fish assemblages over 26 yr (1985-2011) and 427-km stretch of the river Meuse (France and Belgium). The study of temporal variations in biological, physiological, and ecological traits of macroinvertebrate and fish allowed identifying community trends and distinguishing impacts of environmental perturbations from those induced by biological alterations. We provide evidence, for this large European river, of an increase in water temperature (close to 1 degrees C) and a decrease in phytoplankton biomass (-85\%), as well as independent effects of these changes on both invertebrate and fish communities. The reduction of trophic resources in the water column by invasive molluscs has dramatically affected the density of omnivorous fish in favor of invertebrate feeders, while scrapers became the major feeding guild among invertebrates. Macroinvertebrate and fish communities have shifted from large-sized organisms with low fecundity to prolific, small-sized organisms, with early maturity, as a response to increased predation pressure.},

title={Is microwave digestion using TFM vessels a suitable preparation method for Pt determination in biological samples by adsorptive cathodic stripping voltammetry?},
abstract={The occurrence of Pt in environmental matrices is increasing since the introduction of automobile catalytic converters. Given that Pt is bioavailable and causes biological effects in plants and animals, respective biomonitoring programs are in high demand. But the analytical methods for conducting such programs have not yet been sufficiently established. Therefore, a study was carried out to develop a microwave digestion of biological samples, which allows a rapid determination of Pt by adsorptive cathodic stripping voltammetry. A high pressure microwave system was used and the digestion was performed in HNO(3) and HCI. After digestion the HNO(3) was evaporated with a microwave assisted vacuum concentration set. The study resulted in a procedural detection limit of 37.5 ngL(-1) and a relative standard deviation of 18\%. A recovery study resulted in a Pt loss below 5\%. The microwave assisted evaporation of HNO(3) performed satisfactorily and up to 500 mL of the sample solution could be used for the voltammetric measurements without any effect on the peak heights. A direct comparison of Pt concentrations conducted after microwave digestion and digestion by high pressure ashing showed similar values. However, these promising results were not persistent throughout the repeated analysis using the same Teflon vessels. The vessels did not endure the harsh conditions and due to aging processes the Pt loss consistently increased until Pt determination in environmental relevant concentrations became impossible. Quartz vessels could not be employed as an alternative to the Teflon vessels, due to a lack of compatibility with the vacuum concentration system. Consequently, the results of this paper show that there is a need for further development of more resistant Teflon materials. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

title={The role of temperature and oxygen availability on the distribution of Corbicula largillierti},
abstract={The invasiveness of Corbicula largillierti has been underestimated, but this bivalve is currently receiving more attention. The first study of the distribution of this species along one of the major basins of central Argentina showed that it was completely absent in the major central reservoir, but was present along its tributary and effluent rivers. Ten years later, this discontinuous distribution has not changed, despite the bivalve's high dispersion capacity. The main environmental differences between the reservoir and the rivers are that the former has finer sediment grain size, higher temperatures, and lower oxygen concentration during summer months. This study aimed to evaluate whether one of these factors could be limiting the distribution of C. largillierti. We assessed the metabolic response and burial behavior (under different grain sizes) of C. largillierti over 8 weeks at 30 degrees C against a control condition at 20 degrees C. We also analyzed the oxygen consumption (vO(2)) as a function of environmental oxygen concentration (pO(2)) at 25 degrees C, estimating its metabolic regulation capacity (R). This showed the existence of an environmental oxygen concentration threshold (P-t) that could be an indicative of physiological limiting concentrations that compromise species survival and settlement. After 8 weeks at 30 degrees C, the metabolic rate of individuals of C. largillierti increased and their burial behavior was slightly compromised but mostly for coarser sediments. Concerning environmental oxygen availability, C. largillierti is an oxyconformer with a low R (39.9\%), a clear pattern of negative regulation, and a low P-t (48.4\% air saturation). The lack of any regulation capacity of C. largillierti under environmental oxygen limitations and the extremely low pO(2) at the bottom of the reservoir during summer months may explain its failure to colonize and survive there.},

title={Environmental modulation of reproductive activity of the invasive mussel Limnoperna fortunei: implications for antifouling strategies},
abstract={Limnoperna fortunei (Dunker, 1857) (Bivalvia) invaded Argentina through the Rio de la Plata estuary around 1990 and is presently established throughout five South American countries as a dominant component of the benthic fauna and a major nuisance for industry and power plants. Between 1997 and 2006 we monitored the reproductive activity of L. fortunei through weekly measurements of planktonic larvae in six South American water bodies: Rio de la Plata estuary, Parana and Carapachay rivers, Salto Grande, ItaipU and Embalse de Rio Tercero reservoirs. Mean larval densities varied between 4000 and 7000 individuals m-3; except in the reservoirs of ItaipU (450 ind. m-3) and Salto Grande (869 ind. m-3), where the mussel was first recorded shortly before our surveys, and upstream dispersal is limited (Salto Grande). In all cases, reproductive output decreases during the winter. At four of the six sites surveyed larval densities were comparatively high for 8.8-10.2 months per year. A lower food supply is possibly responsible for the shorter reproductive period of 5.9 months at Embalse. At Salto Grande, there is a well-defined mid-summer drop in larval numbers, coinciding with blooms of cyanobacteria. We propose that, in addition to temperature, two major factors may regulate the reproductive activity of L. fortunei: (i) the availability of food; and (ii) blooms of toxic cyanobacteria, significantly shortening the otherwise very long reproductive period. This information is important for the design of antifouling programmes involving the use of molluscicides, and has potential for reduced biocide use. These results provide supporting evidence for some fundamental ecological theories of invasions discussed here.},

title={Guiding large-scale management of invasive species using network metrics},
abstract={Biological invasions involve complex interactions between social and environmental factors, challenging effective management. This study represents the invasion of Minnesota lakes by zebra mussels as a network of interactions and finds that using network metrics can guide effective management. Complex socio-environmental interdependencies drive biological invasions, causing damages across large spatial scales. For widespread invasions, targeting of management activities based on optimization approaches may fail due to computational or data constraints. Here, we evaluate an alternative approach that embraces complexity by representing the invasion as a network and using network structure to inform management locations. We compare optimal versus network-guided invasive species management at a landscape-scale, considering siting of boat decontamination stations targeting 1.6 million boater movements among 9,182 lakes in Minnesota, United States. Studying performance for 58 counties, we find that when full information is known on invasion status and boater movements, the best-performing network-guided metric achieves a median and lower-quartile performance of 100\% of optimal. We also find that performance remains relatively high using different network metrics or with less information (median >80\% and lower quartile >60\% of optimal for most metrics) but is more variable, particularly at the lower quartile. Additionally, performance is generally stable across counties with varying lake counts, suggesting viability for large-scale invasion management. Our results suggest that network approaches hold promise to support sustainable resource management in contexts where modelling capacity and/or data availability are limited.},

title={A paradox of trout invasions in North America},
abstract={A paradox of invasion biology is that even though native species are locally adapted to environmental conditions, nonnative species without this advantage often invade. Ecologists have advanced four main theories to explain why invaders are successful in some places and not others: biotic resistance, environmental resistance, human disturbance, and natural enemies. However, none of these theories alone can account for invasions by two trout species outside their native ranges in North America. Brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) are able to displace native cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii) in the inland western US, but are themselves displaced by nonnative rainbow trout (O. mykiss) in the southeastern US. An alternative hypothesis is that an interaction among zoogeography, evolutionary history, and environmental resistance from the natural flow regimes can account for this paradox. The nonnative species invade successfully at the southern edge of the ranges of the native species, which are farthest from their ancestral origins. Due to their evolutionary history, the native species are poorly adapted to the natural disturbance regime at the southern limit of their ranges, but the nonnative species are preadapted by chance due to theirs. This alternative hypothesis about the interaction between the historical contingency of evolution and environmental resistance should be more widely tested, to inform both invasion biology and the conservation of native trout.},

title={Comparative impact of two glyphosate-based formulations in interaction with Limnoperna fortunei on freshwater phytoplankton},
abstract={Although contamination and invasive species are two of the most relevant anthropogenic drivers affecting ecosystems, their joint impact on the environment has been poorly investigated. Glyphosate, directly or indirectly, contaminates freshwater systems which in turn may be invaded by the golden mussel Limnoperna fortunei. Under laboratory conditions, we studied the combined effect of technical-grade glyphosate, Roundup Max (R) and Glifosato Atanor (R), in scenarios with and without L. fortunei, on phytoplankton from Salto Grande Reservoir (Uruguay River, Argentina). We expected that the effects of the interaction on phytoplankton and water quality would vary with the form of herbicide applied. The assay was conducted for 14 days (TO using 3-L bottles as experimental units. Eight treatments were performed in triplicate: C: Control; M: mussel; G: technical grade glyphosate acid; R: Roundup Max (R); Glifosato Atanor (R); MG: mussel + technical-grade glyphosate acid, MA: mussel + Glifosato Atanor (R) and MR: mussel + Roundup Max (R). The active ingredient was applied at 6 ppm. The dissipation of glyphosate in water was 1.5-2.6 times higher in presence of mussels. Treatments G and A showed an increase in phytoplankton abundance, mainly the cyanobacteria Microcystis spp. with rised to 289\% and 639\% at Tf, respectively, relative to their values at Ti. Roundup Max (R) limited the growth of Microcystis spp., as its abundance decreased 59\% relative to Ti. L. fortunei reduced phytoplankton abundances at Tf. Evenness increased significantly in M, MG, MR and MA, while it decreased in G, R and A relative to C. The interaction of factors produced a significant synergistic increase in periphyton; periphytic chlorophyll a concentration was 0.81 +/- 0.02 mu g cm(-2) for MR; 0.09 +/- 0.02 mu g cm(-2) for MA and 0.02 +/- 0.01 mu g cm(-2) for MG. Limnoperna fortunei appeared as the driving force in the interaction. The assay described here allows for the rapid assessment of the impact of these types of agents on freshwater.},

abstract={Some corbiculids (bivalve clams in the genus Corbicula) are invasive, having spread nearly worldwide and are thought to impact native unionid mussels. To determine the density and distributional associations of invasive corbiculids co-occurring with native unionids, corbiculid clam and unionid mussel surveys were conducted at 122 sites in the Kalamazoo River catchment, Michigan, U.S.A. Unionid densities ranged from 0 to 97 (x(-) = 7.45 +/- 15.38 SD) live unionids found per person hour while corbiculid densities varied from 0 to 0.24 (0.012 +/- 0.037) g/cm(3). Corbiculid distributions were clumped (Moran's I test: Index = 0.281, Z = 2.228, p = 0.026) and highest along the main branch of the river. Unionid distributions, both individual species and at family level, were found to be randomly distributed throughout the catchment (Moran's I test: Index = 0.343 to -0.022, Z = 1.913 to -0.118, p value = 0.056 to 0.970). Overall, unionid species richness, as well as the distribution of 13 unionid species, were negatively associated with corbiculid density. Although corbiculids can inhabit the same river reaches with unionids, unionid species richness and densities may be negatively influenced by the presence of corbiculids. Although many species of unionids were negatively associated with corbiculid density, our research showed that they can co-exist in the same river reaches. Overall, unionids were positively correlated with corbiculids throughout the catchment, probably because the two groups have similar habitat requirements. It is therefore important to consider unionids and corbiculids concurrently in conservation planning and the management of invasive corbiculids.},

abstract={Several Ponto-Caspian species, such as dreissenid and mud shrimp species have become massive invaders in freshwater ecosystems of Europe and North America. In order to understand the ability of other Ponto-Caspian groups to expand and invade other regions, their occurrence and adaptation within areas that can act as a vector need to be understood. Several Ponto-Caspian polychaete species might be capable to become invasive as well. Understanding their ecological tolerances and distribution dynamics in waterways that link them to other regions is therefore imperative to acknowledge their invasive potential. In this study we examine the distribution patterns of three PC polychaete species in the Danube River and delta area in order to assess whether the region might be a corridor for these species to spread into central Europe and beyond. The results revealed that the three studied species greatly vary in distribution and environmental tolerances, but that two of the three show ecological tolerances and distribution range extensions that make them potentially very invasive. Our study provides a baseline for further distribution studies of PC polychaetes and details their habitat requirements. The possibility that the two Ponto-Caspian polychaete species could use the Danube corridor to realise a massive range extension is new and raises several conservation concerns. It is imperative to understand invasive potential and distribution dynamics in order to prepare effective measurements to limit spread of potentially harmful species, such as Ponto-Caspian mussels, mud shrimps and in this case polychaete.

title={Biological invasions across spatial scales: Intercontinental, regional, and local dispersal of cladoceran zooplankton},
abstract={The frequency of dispersal of invertebrates among lakes depends upon perspective and spatial scale. Effective passive dispersal requires both the transport of propagules and the establishment of populations large enough to be detected. At a global scale, biogeographic patterns of cladoceran zooplankton species suggest that effective dispersal among continents was originally rare, but greatly increased in the past century with expanded commerce. Genetic analysis allows some reconstruction of past dispersal events. Allozyme and mitochondrial DNA comparisons among New World and Old-World populations of several exotic cladocerans have provided estimates for likely source populations of colonists, their dispersal corridors, and timing of earlier dispersal events. Detecting the Old-World tropical exotic Daphnia lumholtzi early in its invasion of North America has allowed detailed analysis of its spatial spread. Twelve years of collection records indicate a rapid invasion of reservoirs in the United States, by both regional spread and long-distance jumps to new regions. Combining landscape features with zooplankton surveys from south-central US reservoirs revealed higher colonization rates of D. lumholtzi at lower landscape positions, a result which can be explained by either greater propagule load or by higher susceptibility of these downstream reservoirs. Because invaded reservoirs provide a source of propagules for nearby floodplain ponds, the rarity of this species in ponds suggests limitation by local environments. Such analyses of invading species over multiple spatial scales allow a better understanding of ecological processes governing invasion dynamics.},

abstract={Since 1995, Dikerogammarus Villosus SONVINSKI, a Ponto-Caspian amphipod species, has been invading most of Western Europe's hydrosystems. D. villosus geographic extension and quickly increasing population density has enabled it to become a major component of macrobenthic assemblages in recipient ecosystems. The ecological characteristics of D. villosus on a mesohabitat scale were investigated at a station in the Moselle River. This amphipod is able to colonize a wide range of substratum types, thus posing a threat to all freshwater ecosystems. Rivers whose dominant substratum is cobbles and which have tree roots along the banks could harbour particularly high densities of D. villosus. A relationship exists between substratum particle size and the length of the individuals, and spatial segregation according to length was shown. This allows the species to limit intra-specific competition between generations while facilitating reproduction. A strong association exists between D. villosus and other Ponto-Caspian species, such as Dreissena polymorpha and Corophium curvispinum, in keeping with Invasional Meltdown Theory. Four taxa (Coenagrionidae, Calopteryx splendens, Corophium curvispinum and Gammarus pulex) exhibited spatial niches that overlap significantly that of D. villosus.

title={The effect of temperature and salinity on the survival of Mytilopsis leucophaeata larvae (Mollusca, Bivalvia): The search for environmental limits},
abstract={The brackish water mussel, Mytilopsis leucophaeata, is a rapidly expanding invasive bivalve in Europe with great biofouling capacities. Being a typical brackish water species with very broad habitat preferences and environmental limits, adults are extremely tolerant to fluctuations in temperature and salinity. The life cycle of mussels however, consists of two phases: (1) from fertilization until larval settlement they are pelagic, only protected by a larval soft shell and (2) after settlement, the individuals become benthic and develop a hard mytiliform shell. The fact that adult mussels can close their protective valves is the major reason why they are important fouling species and are difficult to remove once settled. Therefore, vulnerability of different larval life stages of M. leucophaeata to temperature and salinity was investigated during standardized acute 48 h experimental tests. In addition, the survival limits of the most vulnerable larval life stage were determined at different temperature-salinity combinations. Results indicated that larval stages show a differential vulnerability: 4 h old embryos were more vulnerable to changes in temperature and salinity than 2 day old larvae. Maximal survival of 4 h old embryos was found at 22 degrees C at salinity 15. Surrounding this optimum, conditions stayed good for survival in a rather wide range: only salinities of 0 and 25 and temperatures below 10 degrees C or above 30 degrees C caused high embryonic mortality. Thus, even the most vulnerable larval stage in the life cycle of M. leucophaeata can be considered highly resistant to environmental conditions. Considering the broad environmental limits of adult as well as larval M. leucophaeata, we can expect this species to appear many brackish water bodies worldwide, with only colder regions potentially limiting its invasion success.

Despite the inherent risks, there is currently relatively little routine surveillance of marine pest species conducted in the majority of countries worldwide. Accurate and rapid identification of marine pest species is central to early detection and management. Traditional techniques (e.g. physical sampling and sorting), have limitations, which has motivated some progress towards the development of molecular diagnostic tools. This review provides a brief account of the techniques traditionally used for detection and describes developments in molecular-based methods for the detection and surveillance of marine pest species.

abstract={Post-establishment spread of invasive species is a major determinant of their impact, but the spatial pattern and temporal rhythm of secondary spread are often poorly known or understood. Here we examine the spread of the European rockweed Fucus serratus over 1,500 km of shoreline after its initial discovery in Pictou, Nova Scotia (Canada) in 1868. Building upon earlier periodic surveys, we document the current distribution of this invader and provide a historic analysis of the invasion, including the integration of the recently-detected multiple introductions from Europe. The initial spread was rapid in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence (6.0 km year(-1)), likely due to both natural spread in a favorable environment and the extensive regional shipping traffic at the time which linked Pictou to several key ports in eastern Canada and northeast USA. Later spread, especially along the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia, was slower (recently 0.9 km year(-1)), but included several major jumps (similar to 50-500 km), undoubtedly due to human-mediated transport. Although the spatial extent of the invasion has increased over the past 140 years, it has experienced several remarkable events: apparent local extinctions of northern satellite populations, a major retraction (100-150 km) along the northwestern limits of its continuous range, and stalled invasions at several points and times during its southward progression. Distributional data suggest that this invader is excluding congeners in shallow zones and possibly kelp species in deeper zones. Genetic data from one contact zone showed hybridization with native F. distichus but no evidence for introgression in migrating F. serratus. Hybridization and several other reproductive traits likely contribute to the competitive dominance of the invader in this environment.},

abstract={The invasion of dreissenid mussels has profoundly altered benthic physical environments and whole-lake nutrient cycling in the Great Lakes over the past several decades. The resurgence of the filamentous green alga Cladophora appears to be one of the consequences of this invasion. Sloughed Cladophora deteriorates water quality, fouls recreational beaches, and may contribute to outbreaks of avian botulism, which have been espe-cially severe in the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore (SLBE) region of Lake Michigan. To help determine the fate of sloughed Cladophora, a Lagrangian particle trajectory model was developed to track the transport of Cladophora fragments in the nearshore zone based upon a physical transport-mixing model. The model results demonstrate that the primary deposition sites of sloughed Cladophora within the SLBE region are mid-depth sites not far away from their initial growth area. Because of high algae production in the nearshore waters and limited exchange between the inner and outer bay, the shoreline beach of Platte Bay appears to be particularly vulnerable to fouling, with overall three times as many accumulated particles as those along the Sleeping Bear Bay and Good Harbor Bay. The results of this model may be used to guide regional environmental management initiatives and provide insights into the mechanisms responsible for avian botulism outbreaks. This model may also inform the development of whole-lake ecosystem models that account for nearshore-offshore interactions.},

title={Recreational watercraft decontamination: can current recommendations reduce aquatic invasive species spread?},
abstract={Decontaminating recreational watercraft, and fishing, sailing or watersports equipment after use can reduce the overland dispersal of aquatic invasive species (AIS) among lakes. Recommended methods include pressure-washing, rinsing with hot water, using cleaning agents, or air-drying, but the extent of their efficacy is unknown. The aim of this review is to assess the effectiveness of current decontamination measures for recreational watercraft against various AIS. Web of Science, Greenfile, Environment Complete and Geobase were searched for articles published through September 2019. Studies on preventing overland AIS spread, and plant and invertebrate AIS response to hot water, pressure-washing, desiccation or cleaning agents, were selected. Of 37 studies included in the review, the majority (70.3\%) assessed air-drying, followed by hot water (32.4\%), household chemicals (16.2\%), and pressure-washing (2.7\%). The recommended air-drying duration of up to one week produced high mortality (>= 90\%) among several invertebrate and macrophyte species, although survival was high for certain aquatic snails. Larger and/or older invertebrates were more resistant to desiccation. Aquatic plant survival and growth were inversely related to water loss (a function of drying time and relative humidity), and short or single fragments were less resistant to air-drying than larger or clustered fragments. Immersion in water >= 50 degrees C for 15 minutes resulted in 100\% mortality among mussels, small invertebrates and some plant species. A higher temperature of 60 degrees C was required for hot water spray applications lasting >= 5 seconds to achieve the same mortality rate among dreissenid mussels. High pressure-washing eliminated significantly more entangled plants, and small organisms and seeds than low pressure. Household chemicals such as salt or bleach required specific doses and immersion durations to be lethal to small organisms. This review reveals that current decontamination methods may be effective, but their efficacy against a diversity of AIS, including those on watch lists, are not yet well-understood. As the literature is currently skewed towards studies on air-drying, which has limited efficacy, further research is required to evaluate practical, and alternate or combined measures to best inform management practices.},

title={Effects of environmental factors on the distribution of the exotic species Mytilopsis sallei (Recluz, 1849) (Bivalvia: Dreissenidae) on the Northeast coast of Brazil},
abstract={The invasive bivalve Mytilopsis sallei caused several economic and ecological impacts in Asia. In Brazil, M. sallei was first reported in 2004, and thus far, little is known about its ecological impact on Brazilian estuaries. The present study aims to evaluate the abundance and distribution of M. sallei and to analyse the environmental factors that led to the establishment of this species in a Brazilian Northeast estuary. Sampling was carried out in six stations along the estuary, covering a broad spectrum of salinities. Results showed that M. sallei was the most abundant benthic species in this estuary, although it was not broadly distributed, occurring only in one station (S1), the most polluted and the one with the lowest salinities (mean 17.3 +/- 11.56), which was the abiotic factor controlling the distribution of M. sallei. This station also had the lowest diversity of species (H' = 0.3269). The main M. sallei microhabitat was the pneumatophores roots from mangrove trees and decomposing wood. Despite the high abundance of M. sallei in S1, this species experienced negative effect of other benthic species suggesting that its distribution was limited by the high abundance of native species in other stations. Our results suggest that the distribution of M. sallei is influenced by a set of characteristics: preference for low salinity, favourable substrate type, tolerance to pollutants, and less direct competitors. Understanding how invasive species are distributed and relate to native species will provide more robust strategies to help maintain environmental health that ultimately will prevent the expansion of M. sallei population.},

title={Unveiling the Ecological Applications of Ancient DNA From Mollusk Shells},
abstract={The shells of marine mollusks represent promising metagenomic archives of the past, adding to bones, teeth, hairs, and environmental samples most commonly examined in ancient DNA research. Seminal work has established that DNA recovery from marine mollusk shells depends on their microstructure, preservation and disease state, and that authentic ancient DNA could be retrieved from specimens as old as 7,000 years. Here, we significantly push the temporal limit for shell DNA recovery to >= 100,000 years with the successful genetic characterization of one Portlandia arctica and one Mytilus mussel sample collected within a dated permafrost layer from the Taimyr Peninsula, Russia. We expand the analysis of ancient DNA in carbonate shells to a larger number of genera (Arctica, Cernuella, Crassostrea, Dreissena, Haliotis, Lymnaea, Margaritifera, Pecten, Ruditapes, Venerupis) from marine, freshwater and terrestrial environments. We demonstrate that DNA from ancient shells can provide sufficient resolution for taxonomic, phylogenetic and/or population assignment. Our results confirm mollusk shells as long-term DNA reservoirs, opening new avenues for the investigation of environmental changes, commercial species management, biological invasion, and extinction. This is especially timely in light of modern threats to biodiversity and ecosystems.},

title={Evidence for interactions among environmental stressors in the Laurentian Great Lakes},
abstract={Co-occurrence of environmental stressors is ubiquitous in ecosystems, but cumulative effects are difficult to predict for effective indicator development. Individual stressors can amplify (synergies) or lessen (antagonisms) each other's impacts or have fully independent effects (additive). Here we use the Laurentian Great Lakes, where a multitude of stressors have been studied for decades, as a case study for considering insights from both a systematic literature review and an expert elicitation (or structured expert judgment) to identify stressor interactions. In our literature search for pairs of stressors and interaction-related keywords, relatively few studies (9\%, or 6/65) supported additive interactions with independent stressor effects. Instead, both antagonisms (42\%, or 27/65) and synergies (49\%, or 32/65) were common. We found substantial evidence for interactions of invasive dreissenid mussels with nutrient loading and between pairs of invasive species (predominantly dreissenids x round goby), yet both sets of records included mixtures of synergies and antagonisms. Complete quantification of individual and joint effects of stressors was rare, but effect sizes for dreissenid mussels x nutrient loading supported an antagonism. Our expert elicitation included discussion in focus groups and a follow-up survey. This process highlighted the potential for synergies of nutrient loading with dreissenid mussels and climate change as seen from the literature review. The elicitation also identified additional potential interactions less explored in the literature, particularly synergies of nutrient loading with hypoxia and wetland loss. To stimulate future research, we built a conceptual model describing interactions among dreissenid mussels, climate change, and nutrient loading. Our case study illustrates the value of considering results from both elicitations and systematic reviews to overcome data limitations. The simultaneous occurrence of synergies and antagonisms in a single ecosystem underscores the challenge of predicting the cumulative effects of stressors to guide indicator development and other management and restoration decisions.},

title={Explosive demographic expansion by dreissenid bivalves as a possible result of astronomical forcing},
abstract={Human induced range expansions of invasive dreissenid bivalves are of great concern. However, the underlying biological processes are only poorly understood, partly due to the lack of information on natural expansion events. Here we use the extinct bivalve species Sinucongeria primiformis as a model organism for testing natural (i.e. pre-Anthropocene) blooms of dreissenid species in a lacustrine system of Lake Pannon during the Tortonian (similar to 10.5 Myr; late Miocene). A total of 600 samples from a consecutive core were evaluated for the relative abundance of this pavement-forming mollusc, which cover about eight millennia of late Miocene time with a decadal resolution. Our data indicate that the settlement by bivalves in the offshore environment was limited mainly by bottom water oxygenation, which follows predictable and repetitive patterns through time. These population fluctuations might be related to solar cycles: successful dreissenid settlement is recurring in a frequency known as the lower and upper Gleissberg cycles with 50-80 and 90-120 yr periods. These cycles appear to control regional wind patterns, which are directly linked to water mixing of the lake. This is modulated by the even more prominent 500 yr cycle, which seems to be the most important pacemaker for Lake Pannon hydrology.},

title={Effects of Upper-Limit Water Temperatures on the Dispersal of the Asian Clam Corbicula fluminea},
abstract={Temperature is a determinant environmental variable in metabolic rates of organisms ultimately influencing important physiological and behavioural features. Stressful conditions such as increasing temperature, particularly within high ranges occurring in the summer, have been suggested to induce flotation behaviour in Corbicula fluminea which may be important in dispersal of this invasive species. However, there has been no experimental evidence supporting this hypothesis. It was already proven that C. fluminea drift is supported by a mucilaginous drogue line produced by mucocytes present in the ctenidia. Detailed microscopic examination of changes in these cells and quantification of clam flotation following one, two and three weeks of exposure to 22, 25 and 30 degrees C was carried out so that the effects of increasing water temperatures in dispersal patterns could be discussed. Results show that changes in temperature triggered an acceleration of the mucocytes production and stimulated flotation behaviour, especially following one week of exposure. Dilution of these effects occurred following longer exposure periods. It is possible that these bivalves perceive changing temperature as a stress and respond accordingly in the short-term, and then acclimate to the new environmental conditions. The response patterns suggest that increasing water temperatures could stimulate C. fluminea population expansion.},

title={Linking environmental warming to the fitness of the invasive clam Corbicula fluminea},
abstract={Climate warming is discussed as a factor that can favour the success of invasive species. In the present study, we analysed potential fitness gains of moderate warming (3 degrees C above field temperature) on the invasive clam Corbicula fluminea during summer and winter. The experiments were conducted under seminatural conditions in a bypass-system of a large river (Rhine, Germany). We showed that warming in late summer results in a significant decrease in the clams' growth rates (body mass and shell length increase) and an increase in mortality rate. The addition of planktonic food dampens the negative effect of warming on the growth rates. This suggests that the reason for the negative growth effect of temperature increase in late summer is a negative energetic balance caused by an enhanced metabolic rate at limited food levels. Warming during early summer revealed contrasting effects with respect of body mass (no warming effect) and shell length (increased shell growth with warming). This differential control of both parameters further enhances the loss of the relative (size-specific) body mass with warming. In contrast, warming in winter had a consistently positive effect on the clams' growth rate as demonstrated in two independent experiments. Furthermore, the reproduction success (as measured by the average number of larvae per clam) during the main breeding period (April) was strongly enhanced by experimental warming during winter, i.e. by eight times during the relatively cold winter 2005/2006 and by 2.6 times during the relatively warm winter 2007/2008. This strong, positive effect of moderate winter warming on the clams' fitness is probably one reason for the recent invasion success of C. fluminea in the northern hemisphere. However, warm summer events might counteract the positive winter warming effect, which could balance out the fitness gains.},
