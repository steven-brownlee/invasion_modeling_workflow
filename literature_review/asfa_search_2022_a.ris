T1  - Integrated RNA-seq and RNAi Analysis of the Roles of the <i>Hsp70</i> and <i>SP</i> Genes in Red-Shell <i>Meretrix meretrix</i> Tolerance to the Pathogen <i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</i>
AN  - 2724418655
AB  - Abstract The “Wanlihong” Meretrix meretrix (WLH-M) clam is a new variety of this species that has a red shell and stronger Vibrio tolerance than ordinary M. meretrix (ORI-M). To investigate the molecular mechanisms responsible for the WLH-M strain’s tolerance to Vibrio, we challenged clams with Vibrio parahaemolyticus and then assessed physiological indexes and conducted transcriptome analysis and RNA interference experiments. The mortality, tissue bacterial load, and hemocyte reactive oxygen species level of ORI-M were significantly higher than those of WLH-M, whereas the content and activity of lysozyme were significantly lower. Gene Ontology functional annotation analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis revealed that immune and metabolic pathways were enriched in Vibrio-challenged clams. The expressions of the heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) and serine protease (SP) genes, which are involved in antibacterial immunity, were significantly upregulated in WLH-M but not in ORI-M, while the expression of the kynurenine 3-monooxygenase gene, a proinflammatory factor, was significantly downregulated in WLH-M. RNA interference experiments confirmed that Hsp70 and SP downregulation could result in increased mortality of WLH-M. Therefore, we speculate that Hsp70 and SP may be involved in the antibacterial immunity of WLH-M in vivo. Our data provided a valuable resource for further studies of the antibacterial mechanism of WLH-M and provided a foundation for the breeding of pathogen-resistant strains.

T1  - A review of the role of probiotics for the control of viral diseases in aquaculture
AN  - 2716381180
AB  - The advancement of technology, globalization of trade, massive demand, and cost-effective practices has fuelled the fast expansion of the aquaculture industry in recent time. Viral infections, on the contrary, limit aquaculture production, affecting the global economic progression and prosperity. Disease managements accomplished through conventional methods, synthetic chemicals, or antibiotics were found to have detrimental effects on the environment. Again, the incidents of viral infection may become epizootics if fish healthcare professionals may not have an effective hazard management mechanism in place. The chief approach to preventing viral epidemics is to stop the infection from spreading. Under such circumstances, the probiotics appear as the most promising approach to the prevention of viral infections and pathogenicity. Bacterial probiotics like Pediococcus acidilactici, Pseudomonas sp., Vibrio sp., Bacillus sp., Aeromonas sp., Pseudoalteromonas sp., Alteromonas sp., Lactobacillus casei, Lactococcus lactis, and Lactobacillus plantarum, and algal paraprobiotics (ghost probiotic) like Nannochloropsis gaditana are found to be effective in controlling viral pathogens allied with aquaculture. The study revealed the conventional strategies available in aquaculture against viruses. The study also provides a conception of probiotics, their mode of application, and approaching standpoints related to the remediation of viral diseases in aquaculture.

T1  - Habitat complexity in shallow lakes and ponds: importance, threats, and potential for restoration
AN  - 2715907326
AB  - In this review we describe patterns and mechanisms by which habitat complexity is crucial for the functioning of shallow lakes and ponds, and for the abundance and diversity of biological communities in these ecosystems. Habitat complexity is affected by processes acting at different spatial scales, from the landscape  to the ecosystem level (i.e., morphometric attributes) that generate different complexities, determining the potential for organisms to succeed and processes to occur, such as energy and nutrient transfer, and fluxes of greenhouse gases, among others. At the local scale, the three major habitats, pelagic, littoral, and benthic, are characterised by different degrees of structural complexity and a particular set of organisms and processes. Direct and indirect effects of changes in within-lake habitat complexity can either hinder or promote regime shifts in these systems. We also review several anthropogenic pressures (eutrophication, urbanisation, introduction of exotic species, and climate change) that decrease lake resilience through changes in habitat complexity and strategies for habitat complexity restoration. Overall, we emphasize the need to preserve and/or restore habitat complexity as key challenges to account for ecosystem integrity, maintenance of local/regional biodiversity, and for the provision of crucial ecosystem services (e.g., biodiversity, self-purification, and carbon sequestration).

T1  - Can grazing and/or nutrient excretion by the native bivalve <i>Diplodon parallelopipedon</i> (Hyriidae) boost phytoplankton-cyanobacterial development?
AN  - 2715906775
AB  - Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are common in freshwater ecosystems and promote poor water quality. Toxins released by cyanobacteria affect animals and humans. Eutrophication is assumed to be one of the causes for the increase of HABs. Alternatively, bivalves can directly control phytoplankton biomass through filtration and nutrients excretion. However, these interaction remains less known about different bivalve species. Diplodon parallelopipedon (native to South America) is capable of consuming a wide range of particles by filter feeding and release nutrients available for phytoplankton. The aim of this study was to understand the role of the native bivalve D. parallelopipedon in phytoplankton dynamics. First, we compared grazing of 2 different food sources: (i) laboratory culture of Cryptomonas spp. (C) and (ii) wild populations of Microcystis aeruginosa complex (MAC). Both food sources were mixed to create a gradient of relative abundance expressed in % of MAC:C treatments: (1) 100 MAC, (2) 75:25, (3) 50:50, (4) 25:75, and (5) 100 C. Second, we studied nitrogen and phosphorus excretion rates displayed by D. parallelopipedon. Our results supported the hypothesis that D. parallelopipedon might favor the occurrence of MAC blooms by three mechanisms. On one hand, not being able to consume it when it is forming scums. Moreover, D. parallelopipedon actively consumed potential competitors. Finally, Diplodon potentially boosts MAC growth by nutrient releasing.

T1  - Effects of relic low-head dams on stream denitrification potential: seasonality and biogeochemical controls
AN  - 2715900166
AB  - The majority of dams in the contiguous United States are small, low-head dams that are no longer operational but can influence the water quality of contemporary stream ecosystems. Potential effects of low-head dams on stream nitrogen removal (denitrification) have been rarely quantified, and yet they can be an important part of the decision-making process of removing low-head dams. Here, we provide novel empirical data on potential denitrification rates and their biogeochemical controls above and below two mid-Atlantic low-head dams over a 2-year period. Our results show that low-head dams did not increase streambed potential denitrification in comparison to dam-free sections in the same rivers. In our study sites, potential denitrification above low-head dams was generally low (15.7 ± 3.5 µg N [kg sediment]−1 h−1) despite recurring events of water hypoxia (< 50% dissolved oxygen saturation) and high NO3− and DOC concentrations. Overall, we observed higher potential denitrification during winter samplings (9.2 and 50.1 µg N [kg sediment]−1 h−1 on average) and significant effects of sediment surface area and organic matter content on potential denitrification rates above the dams. Results from this study suggest limited effects of relic low-head dams on nitrogen removal and transport in stream ecosystems, and can contribute to the decision-making process of removing low-head dams.

T1  - The occurrence of tire wear compounds and their transformation products in municipal wastewater and drinking water treatment plants
AN  - 2710030403
AB  - In the present study, 29 chemicals derived from tire wear were monitored by deploying Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Samplers (POCIS) in four WWTPs and two drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) located in a municipality in southern Ontario, Canada. Target analytes included 1,3-diphenylguanidine (DPG), the oxidation byproduct of N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N′-phenyl-1,4-benzenediamine called 6PPD-quinone, hexamethoxymethylmelamine (HMMM), and 26 of HMMM’s known transformation products (TPs). This study is the first to monitor all these target compounds in DWTPs, as well as to report data for the presence of 6PPD-quinone in WWTPs. HMMM and selected TPs of this compound were detected in POCIS deployed in the WWTPs and in the DWTPs. The maximum estimated time-weighted average (TWA) concentration of HMMM of 83.2 ± 25.2 ng/L was observed in the effluent of one of the WWTPs. The TWA concentrations were not determined for any of the other target analytes, as POCIS sampling rates have not been determined for these chemicals. The total mass of HMMM and its TPs accumulated on POCIS frequently exceeded 4000 ng and the masses were generally lower in WWTP effluents relative to the influents. For other target analytes, the amounts accumulated on POCIS deployed in WWTP effluents frequently exceeded the amounts accumulated on POCIS deployed in the influents. DPG was detected in POCIS deployed in both the WWTPs and the DWTPs, and 6PPD-quinone was detected in POCIS deployed in both the influent and the effluent of WWTPs. We speculate that these tire wear compounds are entering WWTPs through stormwater overflows into the sewers or from commercial sources (e.g., car washes). This study highlights the need for an assessment of both WWTPs and DWTPs as sinks and sources of these tire wear compounds and the efficacy of treatment processes to remove them from both wastewater and drinking water.

T1  - Cold-tolerant traits that favour northwards movement and establishment of Mediterranean and Ponto-Caspian alien aquatic invertebrates
AN  - 2694723770
AB  - Over recent decades, many Mediterranean and Ponto-Caspian aquatic invertebrate species have dispersed northwards and established as non-native species in colder regions. We hypothesized that these species have cold-tolerant traits, which facilitate dispersal into colder climates. Thanks to these traits, Southern European aquatic species are able to cross biogeographic boundaries. We downloaded the list of all alien invertebrate species that were fully aquatic (i.e. lacking terrestrial adults) from the GRIIS database and picked out those Mediterranean and Ponto-Caspian species that have undergone northwards range expansion. We identified traits that may facilitate dispersal to colder climates including the following: small size; capacity for behavioural thermoregulation; feeding habit (omnivorous, filter-feeders, food generalists); quiescence and dormancy (or diapause); freezing avoidance (presence of cryoprotectants); tolerance to low temperatures or eurythermicity; active dispersal; and enhanced reproduction. We statistically tested the null hypotheses that Mediterranean and Ponto-Caspian alien aquatic invertebrate species that dispersed into the north have all of these traits. We used contingency tables populated with raw frequency data with χ2—tests and assessed statistical significance at α of 0.05. We identified 95 Mediterranean and Ponto-Caspian alien aquatic invertebrate species that have shown northwards range extension, 10 (10%) of which were of Mediterranean origin and 85 (90%) of Ponto-Caspian origin. We found that this northwards dispersal from Southern Europe is mainly limited to a few following groups of aquatic invertebrates: small crustaceans, molluscs, cnidarians and annelids. Ability to go to diapause, hibernation or resting period, temperature tolerance and small size were the traits most commonly shared by these organisms. We conclude that Mediterranean and Ponto-Caspian aquatic invertebrate species showing northwards range expansion have cold-tolerant strategies. The traits analysed can favour the establishment of the species.

T1  - The conservation of non-marine molluscs in South America: where we are and how to move forward
AN  - 2713853327
AB  - South America is a high biodiversity continent with five out of 13 countries considered megadiverse. Many major groups within this fauna exhibit high diversity, including non-marine molluscs. With at least 1401 known species, South American molluscs are seriously understudied. The aim of this paper is to review the conservation status of non-marine molluscs in South America, pointing out significant gaps in knowledge and suggesting possible future directions. According to the most recent IUCN Red List only 231 South American non-marine molluscs have been evaluated, with 84 (36%) categorized as Data Deficient. The main knowledge gaps are in taxonomic inventory, especially in unexplored areas, information about current and historic distributions and population sizes, and basic ecological information. Implementation of integrative taxonomy, ecological and distributional studies, exploration of areas and groups as yet largely ignored, development of researcher networks and improvement of public and political awareness and concern about these important and diverse animals are necessary actions for conservation of non-marine molluscs in South America to have any chance of success.

T1  - How Does Cyphenothrin Affect the Freshwater Mussel as In Vitro and In Vivo Models?
AN  - 2712114193
AB  - Cyphenothrin, one of the synthetic pyrethroids, developed as an alternative to organophosphorus and carbamate pesticides. It is used in veterinary medicine and household application against insects. Due to the contamination of the aquatic ecosystems, non-target aquatic organisms are affected. The current study aimed to evaluate the cyphenothrin effects on in vitro and in vivo models of freshwater mussels Unio delicatus Lea, 1863. While antioxidant enzyme (glutathione) was measured in both models, the total hemocyte counts were only detected in vivo models after exposure to cyphenothrin (1 and 10 μg/L) for 24-h and 48-h exposure times. A decrease in total hemocyte count occurred depending on the dose and duration (p < 0.001). In both in vitro and in vivo models of gill and digestive gland tissues, higher glutathione levels were obtained at a dose of 10 μg/L compared to the control groups in both exposure times (p < 0.001). The results of the study suggest that the antioxidant parameters could represent biomarkers to evaluate the effects of pollutants on in vitro and in vivo models of freshwater mussels.

T1  - Acute and Chronic Toxicity Effects of the Heptachlor Pesticide on Tilapia (<i>Oreochromis mossambicus</i>): Impact to Behavioral Patterns and Histopathological Responses
AN  - 2711138662
AB  - Manimekalai, D.; Srinivasan, A.; Padmavathy, P.; Jawahar, P.; George, R., and Arisekar, U., 2022. Acute and chronic toxicity effects of the heptachlor pesticide on tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus): Impact to behavioral patterns and histopathological responses. Journal of Coastal Research, 38(5), 999–1010. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208.Heptachlor is an organochlorine (cyclodiene) insecticide that enters water bodies and affects aquatic organisms such as fishes and shellfishes. Due to its persistent nature, it spreads from the source of its use and pollutes the area. The toxic effect of heptachlor on histopathological changes in the gill, liver, kidney, and muscles of tilapia Oreochromis mossambicus were studied. The experimental fish were exposed to four concentrations of heptachlor, viz., 0.756, 1.513, 3.025, and 6.050 ppm, for a period of 96 hours during an acute toxicity test. In the current study, the lethal concentration (LC50) value of heptachlor on tilapia at 96 hours was calculated as 4.006 ppm. Fish were subjected to three different concentrations of heptachlor (0.2003, 0.4006, and 0.8012 ppm) based on the LC50 value to study the long-term effect of heptachlor. Histological changes such as lamellar fusion, lamellar cell hyperplasia, degenerated secondary gill lamellae; Bowman's space dilation and renal tubules detachment; hepatic cells death, melanomacrophage formation, and multifocal degeneration of myocytes; and myoepithelium vacuolation were observed in the gill, kidney, liver, and muscles, respectively, during acute and chronic exposure to heptachlor. The toxicity study revealed that the heptachlor pesticide is highly toxic to tilapia even at a minimum concentration of 0.756 ppm. Hence, it is suggested that care must be taken not to allow the entry of pesticides into the habitat of fishes.

T1  - Molecular functional analyses of larval adhesion in a highly fouling invasive model ascidian
AN  - 2710027860
AB  - Successful papillary adhesion is the first essential step for serious ascidian biofouling in marine ecosystems; however, the mechanisms of papillary adhesion have not been fully elucidated. Here, we employed transcriptome sequencing to assess the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between papillae and remaining body in the larvae of the highly fouling invasive model ascidian Ciona robusta. Enrichment results for DEGs showed that papillae were adhesive structures with the combined functions of substrate recognition, environmental perception, and adhesive protein synthesis and secretion. Two candidate ascidian papilla adhesive proteins (APAPs), APAP-1 and APAP-2, were identified, expressed, and purified in vitro. Surface coating tests showed that APAP-1 was a cohesive protein while APAP-2 was an interfacial protein involved in the adhesion between papillae and material surface. Collectively, the obtained DEGs and adhesive proteins provide candidates to deeply understand molecular mechanisms of underwater adhesion and further develop anti-fouling strategies in marine ecosystems.

T1  - Abiotic and biotic correlates of the occurrence, extent and cover of invasive aquatic Elodea nuttallii
AN  - 2697209461
AB  - Biological invasions, especially invasive alien aquatic plants, are a major and growing ecological and socioeconomic problem worldwide. Freshwater systems are particularly vulnerable to invasion, where impacts of invasive alien species can damage ecological structure and function. Identifying abiotic and biotic factors that mediate successful invasions is a management priority. Our aim was to determine the environmental correlates of Elodea nuttallii; a globally significant invasive aquatic species.Elodea nuttallii presence/absence (occurrence), extent (patch area) and percentage cover (density) was visually assessed from a boat throughout Lough Erne (approximately 144 km2), County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland during the active summer growth season (July–September). In addition, substrate type and zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha occurrence was recorded. Fourteen water chemistry variables were collected monthly from 12 recording stations throughout the lake during the 9 years before the survey to spatially interpolate values and establish temporal trajectories in their change. Shoreline land use was derived from CORINE land cover maps. Environmental associations between E. nuttallii, substrate, D. polymorpha, water chemistry and land use were assessed.Elodea nuttallii occurrence was positively associated with water conductivity, alkalinity, suspended solids, phosphorus (both total and soluble) and chlorophyll‐a concentrations, but negatively associated with pH and total oxidised nitrogen. E. nuttallii patch extent and proportional cover were positively associated, to varying degrees, with the presence of D. polymorpha, biological oxygen demand, water clarity and soft substrate, but negatively associated with urban development and ammonium.Elodea nuttallii displayed high levels of phenotypic plasticity in response to environmental variation, allowing it to adapt to a wide range of conditions and potentially gain competitive advantage over native or other invasive macrophytes.It is evident that multiple abiotic and biotic factors, including facilitation by co‐occurring invasive dreissenid mussels, interact to influence the distribution and abundance of E. nuttallii. Thus, it is necessary to consider a more comprehensive environmental context when planning Elodea management strategies.

T1  - Translocation as an ultimate conservation measure for the long-term survival of a critically endangered freshwater mussel
AN  - 2697194250
AB  - Pseudunio auricularius (Spengler, 1793) is one of the most threatened unionid species worldwide. Translocation is considered one of the ultimate actions that can save this species from extinction in the Iberian Peninsula. Since 2013, massive mortalities have been recorded in the Canal Imperial de Aragón (CIA), an anthropogenic habitat where the highest density of P. auricularius had been recorded in Spain. An adequacy habitat index was calculated assigning scores to different environmental variables to select the most suitable river stretches receiving the translocated specimens. A total of 638 specimens have been translocated: 291 in 2017, 291 in 2018, and 56 in 2019. The first-year survival in the group of individuals translocated in 2017 was 41.6%. The next year, 95% of these specimens were found alive, suggesting a successful initial establishment. Specimens translocated in 2018 and 2019 showed a survival of c. 69% and 49%, respectively. In contrast, the control group left in CIA in 2017 showed a much lower survival rate of 19.7% after one year, which remained equally low during the next two years. Currently, the conditions in the Ebro River seem to allow a higher survival rate for P. auricularius than those in the CIA; nevertheless, future monitoring should confirm their long-term success.

T1  - A novel multivariate ecological approach to modeling freshwater mussel habitats verified by ground truthing
AN  - 2694102171
AB  - Our study incorporates high-resolution, multivariate ecological niche modeling (ENM) to test whether two putative state-threatened mussel species in East Texas (Fusconaia askewi and F. lananensis) are ecologically differentiated. We forecasted suitable habitat to identify any differences in the taxa’s habitat associations, using a total of 60 environmental layers comprising climate, soil, and hydrology in a multivariate framework. We found the two species were not ecologically different, consistent with other work (e.g., morphology and genetics) suggesting that they are synonymous. We synonymized the two to make an ENM that was then ground truthed by sampling 25 novel sites throughout East Texas. Our ENM significantly distinguished suitable from unsuitable habitat for these sites, identifying five new records. We compared model evaluation metrics using the original data versus the ground-truthed data, and we found that some metrics were more reliable than others. The verified ecological niche modeling approach that we present here can be applied in other studies in riverine environments and has particular relevance to conservation science.

T1  - Acid-volatile sulfide and acid-extractable iron sediment profiles do not track changes in lake trophic status and atmospheric sulfur deposition
AN  - 2681283882
AB  - Sulfide formation in anaerobic lake sediments depends on supply rates of organic carbon and sulfate. Improvements to wastewater treatment plant effluent quality (e.g., lower total phosphorus (P)) and sulfur emissions can affect sulfide formation rates, which, in turn, can affect metal chemistry including internal iron loading. To determine if these improvements corresponded with sulfide and iron-related signals in sediments over time, acid-volatile sulfide (AVS) and acid-extractable iron accumulation rates were measured in sediment cores of two lakes with anaerobic hypolimnia, the formerly eutrophic, now mesotrophic central basin of Lake Erie, one of the Laurentian Great Lakes, and a small meso-eutrophic moraine lake in southern Ontario, Lake St. George. AVS accumulation rates declined gradually in both lakes after 1980 by 95% and 57%, respectively. Acid-extractable iron accumulation rate profiles were similar to AVS in both lakes, but acid-extractable iron rates were several orders of magnitude larger than AVS rates, hence most of the iron was not chemically associated with AVS. In contrast to the gradual declines in AVS, total P loading to Lake Erie did not decline much after 1980, total P concentrations in Lake St. George remained relatively constant between 1980 and 2014, and sulfate concentration decreases were too small in both lakes to account for the large AVS declines after 1980. Hence, productivity and sulfur emission signals appear to have been overridden by diagenetic processes, which produced similar profiles. Therefore, AVS and acid-extractable iron do not appear to be useful as paleo-indicators of trophic status and sulfate deposition.

T1  - Habitat use of the threatened river redhorse (<i>Moxostoma carinatum</i>) in the Grand River, MI, USA
AN  - 2683503474
AB  - The resilience of aquatic ecosystems hinges on our ability to protect the native species that reside within them. The river redhorse (Moxostoma carinatum) is one such example and populations have become low enough to warrant a threatened status by the State of Michigan. An insufficient understanding of the species’ habitat use outside of its spawning season hinders the ability of fisheries managers to implement appropriate habitat protection and restoration measures. To enhance our understanding of river redhorse habitat use, we implanted 15 individuals with radio transmitters during the spring spawning run and tracked their locations over the course of a summer. River redhorse movement varied greatly with some individuals remaining within the spawning area throughout the summer and others traveling as far as 50 km down river. Once post-spawn movement ceased, river redhorse established themselves in small home ranges between 0.04 and 0.12 km2. We found no obvious selection for depth, sediment type, macrophyte presence, or water velocity. Instead, river redhorse strongly selected for habitat containing freshwater mollusks, the primary food source for the species. This suggests that they were seeking foraging habitat during this time period. These findings provide insight into river redhorse management, indicating that the recovery of the species may depend on our ability to protect these newly discovered feeding areas. Future river redhorse management efforts should therefore focus on the protection of native mussels and snails and the maintenance of migration routes between spawning and summer habitats.

T1  - Pelagic cyanobacterial nitrogen fixation in lakes and ponds of different latitudinal zones
AN  - 2682982137
AB  - Excess nitrogen (N) loading is one of the main factors causing eutrophication. Biological N fixation (BNF), as a main contributor to N loading, plays a critical role in the N cycle. The N2 fixation rate (N2fix) is regulated by many factors and is usually higher under conditions of N deficiency. Most studies have focused on the regulation of factors that influence the N2fix in specific aquatic ecosystems or artificial conditions, while fewer have focused on large scale such as the latitudinal distribution of N2fix. To understand the regulation of the N2fix in latitudinal zones, the key factors, and the underlying mechanism, we compared the N2fix in 27 lakes located in different latitudinal zones and analyzed the main regulators. The results showed that (1) heterocyst density (DHet) and the N2fix were highest in low-temperate lakes and were 2.5–2.7 and 11.6–22.1 times greater than in high-temperate lakes and tropical lakes, respectively, in the 99th quantile; (2) DHet increased and then decreased with increasing latitude and radiation, and peaked at 30.28° N and 2300 J/cm/d; (3) DHet was positively correlated with temperature and increased slightly with increasing temperature; (4) N2fix increased and then decreased with increasing latitude, temperature and radiation, and peaked at 38.8° N, 24.21 °C and 2120 J/cm/d. The results suggest that BNF could be regulated by larger scale factors, e.g., temperature and radiation in latitudinal scale. Compared with high-temperate lakes and tropical lakes, low-temperate lakes may face more difficulties in controlling eutrophication due to the potentially higher N loading from BNF under similar nutrient and morphometric conditions.

T1  - Physiological and morphological assessments suggest opposite structural allocation strategies between closely related invasive clams
AN  - 2673714132
AB  - Respiration is a central physiological function related to the rates of energy acquisition, transformation, and use by organisms, while allometric relationships provide insight into patterns of allocation of that energy. To assess life strategy differences between closely related invasive species, we measured oxygen consumption rates, tissue mass, shell mass, and gill area of Corbicula fluminea and Corbicula largillierti clams. We compared patterns of metabolic scaling between the two species using model II regressions. Although oxygen consumption rates were strongly associated with gill area in both species, C. fluminea had consistently higher metabolic rates, shell thickness, and shell mass, but a lower tissue-to-shell mass ratio, than C. largillierti. These differences were more marked among small individuals. Our results suggest opposite structural allocation strategies between the two species. Corbicula fluminea invests more energy in the development of thicker shells in early life stages, which can be subsidized by higher metabolic rates than C. largillierti. By contrast, C. largillierti allocates more energy to tissue mass production. These differences may play a role in explaining contrasting competitive and colonization abilities and geographical distribution patterns between both species in invaded areas.

T1  - Population decline of an endangered unionid, <i>Pronodularia japanensis</i>, in streams is revealed by eDNA and conventional monitoring approaches
AN  - 2673710735
AB  - Environmental DNA (eDNA) is useful to detect the presence of aquatic organisms from water samples, especially for rare and cryptic species. Two freshwater unionid mussels¸ Pronodularia japanensis and Nodularia douglasiae, have rapidly declined over the last three decades and are now threatened with extinction on the Matsuyama Plain, south-western Japan. We designed a species-specific eDNA marker targeting the COI region of P. japanensis. The distribution of this species in the Kunichi River system on the Matsuyama Plain was investigated using both quantitative PCR with this eDNA marker and conventional surveying. We show that the distribution area of P. japanensis did not change between 2013–2014 and 2020–2021, but its density decreased by 99%. eDNA of P. japanensis was detected, with 100% success, from sites where this species was collected by hand. Furthermore, eDNA was detected at nine sites where P. japanensis was not collected but was expected to occur. This study has established a species-specific eDNA marker targeting the COI region of P. japanensis, and this eDNA marker has been validated as effective for surveying the distribution of this species. Using this eDNA marker, extensive investigation of remaining populations and the monitoring of them should improve conservation practices.

T1  - Parasites as Biological Indicators: the Impact of Environmental Quality on the Infections of <i>Lamproglena clariae</i> (Crustacea) on <i>Clarias gariepinus</i> Along the Vaal River, South Africa
AN  - 2669224599
AB  - Anthropogenic activities influence the natural equilibrium of freshwater ecosystems resulting in negative ecological impacts. Differences in the infection variables of Lamproglena clariae in relation to variable water quality influenced by metal pollution were studied at six sites along the Vaal River, South Africa (March 2017 and October 2018). From each sampling site, in situ water quality parameters, water and sediment samples, and a minimum of 10 Clarias gariepinus were collected. Lamproglena clariae specimens collected from the gills of C. gariepinus were used to calculate the prevalence, mean intensity, and mean abundance of the parasite. Metal concentrations in water and sediment were analysed with inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry. Parasite intensity correlated negatively with some water quality parameters (conductivity, salinity, pH, total dissolved solids, and dissolved oxygen). Negative correlations were found between L. clariae (intensity and prevalence) and metal concentrations (Cu, Cr, Zn, Cd) in water. Parasite infections were influenced negatively at sites with high metal concentrations recorded in sediment and water and high levels of organic pollution. Sites that were found to be more polluted had lower mean intensity and mean abundance of L. clariae, indicating pollution affects the survival of this ectoparasite.

T1  - Landscape associations with native and invasive freshwater mussels
AN  - 2666079341
AB  - Landscape impacts on aquatic organisms can play important roles in community structure and distributions, and landscape alteration can present unique challenges for organisms like freshwater mussels (Bivalvia: Unionidae) that can be compounded by the presence of invasive species. This study examined the impacts of landscape variables on native freshwater mussel and invasive Corbicula spp. distributions and densities in the Kalamazoo River watershed, MI, USA. Landscape impacts were analyzed at three spatial scales using GIS and regression tree analyses to determine factors influencing unionid and corbiculid densities. Results indicated that land use, geology, and longitudinal position in the watershed influence densities of unionids and corbiculids. In addition, corbiculid density was found to be important in determining unionid density and distribution at the reach scale. Results showed that landscape variables can influence invasive and native mussel species and emphasize the need to incorporate spatial information into our understanding of the relationships among organisms and their environments. The knowledge gained here contributes to evidence of the impacts that landscape can have on the abundance and distribution of both native and invasive organisms and provides insight into the associations of invasive Corbicula spp. with landscape variables and native unionids at multiple spatial scales.

T1  - Assessing methods for mitigating fungal contamination in freshwater mussel in vitro propagation
AN  - 2666071742
AB  - Many freshwater mussel species are critically imperiled, and propagation is essential for species ‘recovery.’ Fungal contamination can negatively affect in vitro propagation of freshwater mussels; thus, we investigated methods of mitigating fungal contamination. Specifically, we tested the effect of medium replacement frequency and antifungal (Amphotericin B) concentrations on risk of fungal contamination and transformation success of two species, Alasmidonta heterodon and congener, Alasmidonta undulata. We observed a trend of increased contamination risk in treatment groups that received medium replacements every 1 or 2 days (vs. every 3 days), but this trend was not statistically significant. We found that contamination risk differed significantly across Amphotericin B concentrations. Although contamination severity reduced transformation success, we found no significant difference in transformation success based on medium replacement frequency. Amphotericin B concentration was negatively correlated with transformation success, suggesting toxicity at higher concentrations. Additionally, we identified the fungal pathogen (Candida parapsilosis), the first knowledge of this fungus during mussel culture. Our findings suggest that low contamination results in high probability for transformation success; however, there is a tradeoff in higher concentrations of Amphotericin B. This study offers new ideas for improving mussel propagation techniques that may better control fungal contamination and increase transformation success.

T1  - Can artificial magnetic fields alter the functional role of the blue mussel, <i>Mytilus edulis</i>?
AN  - 2665381411
AB  - Along European coasts, the rapid expansion of marine renewable energy devices and their buried power cables, raises major societal concerns regarding the potential effects of their magnetic field emissions (MFs) on marine species and ecosystem functioning. MFs occur at a local spatial scale, which makes sessile species the primary target of chronic and high-intensity exposures. Some of them, as ecosystem engineers, have critical functions in coastal habitats whose behavioral alteration may drive profound consequences at the ecosystem level. In this context, the present experimental study explored the effects of short exposure to direct current MFs, on the feeding behavior of a widespread ecosystem engineer, the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis). A repeated measure design was carried out with adult mussels successively exposed to control treatment (ambient magnetic field of 47 µT) and artificial MF treatment (direct current of 300 µT produced by Helmholtz coils), as measured around power cables. The filtration activity was assessed through valve gap monitoring using an automated image analysis system. The clearance rate was estimated simultaneously by measuring the decrease in algal concentration using flow cytometry. Our findings revealed that mussels placed in MF treatment did not exhibit observable differences in valve activity and filtration rate, thus suggesting that, at such an intensity, artificial MFs do not significantly impair their feeding behavior. However, additional research is required to investigate the sensitivity of other life stages, the effects of mid to long-term exposure to alternative and direct current fields and to test various MF intensities.

T1  - Dietary contributions of the alien zebra mussel <i>Dreissena polymorpha</i> in British freshwater fish suggest low biological resistance to their invasion
AN  - 2659825717
AB  - Native communities can resist the establishment and invasion of alien species through consumptive and/or competitive interactions. The extent of consumptive resistance from freshwater fish to the invasion of zebra mussels Dreissena polymorpha, a globally invasive Ponto-Caspian species, was assessed in two areas in Britain using stable isotope analysis, where mixing models predicted the contribution of putative prey resources (including zebra mussel) to fish diet. Across the sites and species, only roach Rutilus rutilus were predicted to have a diet where zebra mussels contributed highly (predicted contribution: 44%), with literature suggesting that their functional morphology would have facilitated their consumption of this prey item. Predicted contributions of zebra mussels to common bream Abramis brama diet was comparatively low (29%), despite them being present to much larger sizes than roach, and with pike Esox lucius, perch Perca fluviatilis and pikeperch Sander lucioperca also predicted to have low dietary contributions of zebra mussels (0.08%, 24% and 24%, respectively). These results suggest the consumptive resistance to its invasion in Britain has been low and, correspondingly, if there is a management desire to further limit the invasion of zebra mussels then relying on biological resistance to limit their invasion appears to be insufficient.

T1  - Assessment of the heavy metal levels and biomarker responses in the smooth scallop <i>Flexopecten glaber</i> from a heavily urbanized Mediterranean lagoon (Bizerte lagoon)
AN  - 2656979672
AB  - Abstract Marine heavy metal pollution is a worldwide serious issue. Like almost all Mediterranean lagoons, the Bizerte lagoon is highly urbanized and suffers from intensive anthropogenic pressure. In the present study, we screened the metal contamination and biomarker responses in the smooth scallop Flexopecten glaber inhabiting this vulnerable ecosystem. To this end, the concentrations of six heavy metals (HM) (i.e., Cu, Pb, Zn, Cd, Hg, and Fe) and a panel of biochemical endpoints including malondialdehyde (MDA), metallothioneins (MT), reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) were determined in the gills and digestive gland across seasons (warm and cold) and sites (S1 and S2). The distribution of almost all analyzed metals in F. glaber tissues varied significantly between sites, seasons, and organs. The highest levels were recorded at S2 during the warm period. Moreover, the digestive gland was found to accumulate greater concentrations of HM than the gills. Marked spatio-temporal variations were also observed for oxidative stress biomarkers, mainly in the gills, while the digestive gland seems to be rather sensitive to seasonal variability. Particularly, we noticed that among the used biomarkers, MT did not show significant variations in the two tested organs across seasons and sites. From the obtained results, F. glaber appears as a sensitive organism to anthropogenic metal contamination and can be proposed as a promising bioindicator species for marine pollution.

T1  - Diel activity of littoral and epipelagic teleost fishes in the Mediterranean Sea
AN  - 2652732483
AB  - Diel activity patterns are an important aspect of behavioural ecology, yet summarising works on diel activity patterns of fishes are lacking for several regions of the world, including the Mediterranean Sea. Based on a comprehensive review of literature, internet searches, citizen science and personal observations, we compile existing knowledge of diel activity of Mediterranean pelagic and demersal teleosts commonly occurring at depths shallower than 200 m as adults (393 native and 165 newcomer species, representing 124 families), using the categories strictly or mainly diurnal and nocturnal, crepuscular, cathemeral and diel vertical migration. Most of the available data refer to foraging activity patterns of adult fishes, while knowledge of time of reproduction, migratory movements, or territorial defence remains unknown for more than half of the species. Confamilial species often have the same activity pattern, although a high plasticity or diversity in diel activity patterns is seen in some families (Belonidae, Carangidae, Clupeidae, Gadidae, Gobiidae, Scombridae, Scorpaenidae, Sparidae, and Triglidae). We found correlations between adult feeding activity patterns and trophic level, habitat use and depth range: diurnal species have a lower trophic level, prefer shallower depths, and tend to occur over hard bottoms or have multi-habitat use, nocturnal species are mostly carnivorous and prefer soft bottoms in deeper waters, while cathemeral species are commonly carnivorous and pelagic. Our results do not support the hypothesis that nocturnal Indo-Pacific immigrants are more successful colonizers. The present work highlights the perils of over-generalizing activity patterns and shows that several gaps in knowledge of diel activity patterns of fishes remain despite that such knowledge can support conservation efforts.

T1  - Eco-bioengineering tools in ecohydrological assessment of eutrophic water bodies
AN  - 2660198614
AB  - Eutrophication of water bodies and deterioration of water quality are emerging environmental crises. The root causes and consequences of eutrophication are multidirectional. Thus, they provide a huge scope of risk-analysis and risk-assessment in the domain of remediation studies. However, recent restoration studies reveal a global trend of utilizing traditional restoration methods combined with advanced pioneer innovative techniques developed in the field of science and technology. This review introduces a novel approach to consider ecohydrological assessment of eutrophication by classical biomanipulation practices emphasising on their evolution into innovative ‘eco-bioengineering’ methods. The main objective of this study is to critically analyse and recognize the research gaps in classical biomanipulation and appreciate the reproducibility and efficacy of eco-bioengineering methods at micro- and macrolevel aquatic ecosystems. Comprehensive literature review was conducted on offline and online platforms. Our survey revealed (a) continuation of a historical trend in classical biomanipulation practices (61.64%) and (b) an ascending drift in eco-bioengineering research (38.36%) in the last decade (2010–2021). At a global scale, recent biomanipulation research has a skewed distribution in Europe (41.10%), East Asia (32.88%), North America (10.96%), South Africa (4.11%), South America (2.74%), Middle East (1.37%), Oceania (1.37%), and non-specific regions (5.48%). Finally, this review analysis revealed the comprehensiveness of eco-bioengineering methods and their strong ecological resilience to recurrence of eutrophication and fluctuating environmental flows in the future. Therefore, our review reinforces the supremacy of eco-bioengineering methods as cost-effective green technologies providing sustainable solutions to restore the eutrophic waters at a global scale.

T1  - Stable isotope analysis reveals trophic segregation between the invasive zebra mussel <i>Dreissena polymorpha</i> and the native duck mussel <i>Anodonta anatina</i> in Lake Trasimeno (Italy)
AN  - 2654886916
AB  - Non-indigenous freshwater bivalves negatively affect invaded ecosystems through different mechanisms, including inter-specific competition for trophic resources. Here, we investigated in Lake Trasimeno (Central Italy) the diet of the invasive Dreissena polymorpha and the native Anodonta anatina. δ15N and δ13C stable isotopes were measured in winter and summer in bivalves, phytoplankton, and sedimentary organic matter (SOM); the relative dietary contributions of the two resources were determined using Bayesian mixing models. To elucidate the different carbon and nitrogen pools characterizing the study site, isotopic analyses were extended to zooplankton and to representatives of the benthic flora and macroinvertebrate fauna. Independently from the season, the two bivalves showed a limited trophic overlap, as mixing models indicated for D. polymorpha a diet based primarily on phytoplankton, while A. anatina relied mainly on SOM. Dietary differences were less marked in summer, when comparable isotopic values characterized phytoplankton and SOM. In winter, conversely, the trophic differentiation between the two species was more evident, and corresponded with a significant enrichment in SOM δ13C values, likely due to a substantial contribution of carbon deriving from decaying macrophytes. Whether differences in ecological and behavioral traits alone can explain the observed trophic segregation between the two species, or if they have actively shifted their diet to reduce competition for food is discussed. We conclude emphasizing the need of an advanced resolution of the influence of non-indigenous species on the flux of energy and matter in invaded lentic systems, including Lake Trasimeno.

T1  - A Global Invader Is Possibly Two: First Genetic Investigation of Native Populations of the Estuarine Bivalve <i>Mytilopsis leucophaeata</i> (Dreissenidae)
AN  - 2641697365
AB  - Mytilopsis leucophaeata is an estuarine bivalve native from the Gulf of Mexico and possibly part of the eastern USA, which invaded many regions around the globe. Despite the previous discovery that two genetic lineages of this species exist, one comprising the northeastern USA and Eurasia and another having invaded South America, there were no genetic data about specimens from native areas. We reveal for the first time the COI signatures of two native populations of M. leucophaeata, one in the eastern coast of Florida, another in its western coast, besides analyzing the nuclear gene 28S. The COI sequences from South America (Venezuela and Brazil) are similar to those from Florida, mainly to the population from the western coast, whereas the clade composed of sequences from NE USA and Eurasia diverges by 2.4–3.2% from remaining sequences. The 28S tree also confirmed the distinction of this lineage. We suspect that the cold-tolerant lineage may represent a distinct species originated in the mid-eastern or NE USA, possibly derived from glaciations or the formation of the Labrador Current, and having colonized Eurasia after human introductions. Based on data about ship trades, we also raise the hypothesis that the invasion in South America was composed of two stages, with an initial invasion in Venezuela or nearby Caribbean countries, followed by a secondary invasion in SE Brazil, although requiring further studies. These results may alter deeply our understanding about the invasion of M. leucophaeata around the globe.

T1  - Parasites of Coregonines in the Genera Coregonus and Prosopium (Salmonidae, Coregoninae) in the Great Lakes
AN  - 2676616943
AB  - The parasites of ciscoes and whitefishes within the subfamily Coregoninae in the Great Lakes and their connecting waters are described and summarized. The report is based on information from the literature and personal observations about mastigophorans, ciliophorans, myxozoans, digenetic trematodes, monogeneans, cestodes, nematodes, acanthocephalans, leeches, copepods, and molluscs of coregonines from 1898 through 2020. Parasites are reported in Longjaw Cisco (Coregonus alpenae), Cisco (C. artedi), Lake Whitefish (C. clupeaformis), Bloater (C. hoyi), Deepwater Cisco (C. johannae), Kiyi (C. kiyi), Blackfin Cisco (C. nigripinnis), C. prognathus (nomem dubium), Shortnose Cisco (C. reighardi), Shortjaw Cisco (C. zenithicus), Round Whitefish (Prosopium cylindraceum), and Pygmy Whitefish (P. coulteri). A total of 62 different studies reported on some aspect of one or more parasite species infecting these coregonine species from the Great Lakes. The emphasis is on the parasites of C. artedi, C. clupeaformis, C. hoyi, and P. cylindraceum since many individuals of these species were examined for parasites in two or more lakes. The largest number of parasite species found in these coregonines was 24 from Lake Superior in C. artedi, 29 from Lake Huron in C. clupeaformis, 15 from Lake Superior in C. hoyi, and 20 from Lake Huron in P. cylindraceum.

T1  - Assessment of shoreline restoration using macroinvertebrates in a Great Lakes Area of Concern
AN  - 2669778724
AB  - Macroinvertebrate community assemblages were examined in three areas of the littoral zone of an impacted, drowned river mouth lake in west Michigan, USA. Muskegon Lake has an extensive history of environmental abuse, resulting in its listing as a Great Lakes Area of Concern. A multi-organizational, shoreline restoration initiative was started in 2009 and completed in 2012. Despite pre- and post-restoration monitoring of water quality, fish assemblages, and macrophytes, no studies had examined the shifts in the littoral zone macroinvertebrate community. Using Hester-Dendy samplers, we collected macroinvertebrates monthly in submergent, emergent, and open macrophyte zones, at two restored sites and one reference site from August 2018 to October 2019. No pre-restoration samples were collected at these sites but we could examine the changes in restored vs. reference sites. In total, 22,931 individuals were observed, with Gammarus spp., Echinogammarus spp., Chironominae, and Dreissena polymorpha being among the most abundant taxa. NMDS results revealed overlap among macroinvertebrate communities between the two restored sites and separation from the reference site, with some overlapping seasonal differences and communities influenced by macrophyte habitat type. Principal components analysis revealed that the environmental factors were strongly influenced by seasonal changes and drove habitat-level differences, rather than spatial variations among sites. Our results indicate that although the macroinvertebrate community composition at the restored sites differed from that at the reference site, the macroinvertebrate assemblage at each site was dominated by tolerant generalist species. Pollution-sensitive macroinvertebrate taxa may have been reduced or eliminated in the lake due to decades of environmental abuse. Periodic monitoring is recommended to determine if these sensitive taxa return, as Muskegon Lake conditions continue to improve.

T1  - Comparative Transcriptomics of the Northern Quahog <i>Mercenaria mercenaria</i> and Southern Quahog <i>Mercenaria campechiensis</i> in Response to Chronic Heat Stress
AN  - 2650107930
AB  - The northern quahog (Mercenaria mercenaria) supports lucrative aquaculture industries in the USA. In the southeastern USA, aquacultured M. mercenaria faces increasing risks of summer die-offs from prolonged heat waves. We used a comparative transcriptomic approach to investigate the molecular responses of M. mercenaria and its southern congener, Mercenaria campechiensis, to controlled incremental heat stress over a 4-week period. Mercenaria were exposed to temperatures from 24 to 34 °C with 2.5 °C/week, after which, gill transcriptomes were de novo assembled and annotated. During the 4 weeks of chronic heat exposure, both species had the same survival rate (96%); M. mercenaria experienced body weight gain/loss depending on the originated hatcheries while M. campechiensis experienced an average net weight loss. The upregulated genes in both species included those in chaperone-mediated protein folding and regulation of cell death pathways, while the downregulated genes in both species involved in mRNA processing and splicing pathways. Compared to M. mercenaria, M. campechiensis appears to be more sensitive to prolonged heat stress as indicated by upregulating significantly more genes in coping with oxidative stress and in the protein degradation pathways, while downregulating some inhibitors of apoptosis. We discussed this finding within their ecological and evolutionary context. Our findings highlighted the potential vulnerability of the two quahogs, especially the southern quahog, to continued ocean warming.

T1  - Replacement of dried freshwater alga <i>Arthrospira maxima</i> with marine diatom <i>Schizochytrium limacinum</i> in a diet of freshwater mussel <i>Unio crassus</i> (Philipsson, 1788)
AN  - 2649845105
AB  - Abstract  The present study was conducted to determine the possible usage of dried Schizochytrium limacinum as a replacement of Arthrospira maxima in a ration of the adult freshwater mussel (Unio crassus). The experimental diets were prepared with the different concentrations of protein-rich green freshwater algae A. maxima and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-rich diatom S. limacinum. Combinations were done by replacing A. maxima with 0%, 30%, 70%, and 100% of dried S. limacinum then named AM100, AM70, AM30, and AM0, respectively. These diets were used to feed 180 individuals (15 mussels/tank) of U. crassus in 12 independent glass (4 groups and 3 replicates) tanks. Live weight gain, shell dimensions, biochemical compositions, and fatty acid contents of U. crassus from whole tissue were examined before and after 30 days of feeding trial. The live weight gain was significantly higher in the AM100 (1.66 ± 1.32 g, 5.00 ± 3.95%) and AM70 (1.32 ± 0.83 g, 4.05 ± 2.56%) groups than in the (0.06 ± 1.91 g, 0.31 ± 5.73%) and AM0 (− 0.17 ± 0.61 g, − 0.52 ± 1.84%) groups. We were able to detect increasing levels of DHA in the U. crassus tissues, while the given ratios of S. limacinum were increased in the diet. The results showed that S. limacinum was digested by adult U. crassus to some extent and DHA was retained in the mussel tissue. These results showed that the dependence on live algae can be decreased in the conservation effort of U. crassus by using S. limacinum in a ration.

T1  - Monitoring and ecological risk of illegal drugs before and after sewage treatment in an area
AN  - 2642626598
AB  - In this study, the occurrence of illicit drugs and their metabolites in the sewerage systems and in the influent and effluent of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Konya, Turkey, was presented. The drug removal efficiencies of the central WWTP were investigated. Potential ecotoxicological risks for algae, fish, and Daphnia magna in the receiving environments were also evaluated. The highest estimated mean illicit drug use was obtained for cannabis (marijuana) at 280 ± 12 mg/day/1000 inhabitants and 430 ± 20 g/day/1000 inhabitants (15–64 years). Amphetamine was found to be the second most consumed drug of abuse. While cannabis and ecstasy consumption values were higher during the weekend, cocaine use dominated on weekdays. The removal efficiencies for THC-COOH and THC-OH were 100% in the WWTP. The average removal of cocaine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDMA, MDA, and methadone varied between 46 ± 7 and 87 ± 3%. The maximum concentration level of MDMA found can pose some low risk for Daphnia magna. The rest of the compounds detected in effluents did not show any toxic effects on fish, Daphnia magna, or algae. However, when the cumulative estimated risk quotient values were evaluated, there might be a low risk for Daphnia magna and algae in the receiving environment.

T1  - Impact of zebra mussels on physiological conditions of unionid mussels in Texas
AN  - 2639123087
AB  - Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) are an invasive species known to detrimentally affect native unionid mussels, a highly imperiled group of organisms. Yet, no study has compared the impact of infestation (direct attachment to unionid mussel shells) and presence of zebra mussels on glycogen storage under controlled conditions, nor examined the impact of zebra mussels at the southern edge of their North American distribution. Hence, the objectives of this study were to (1) examine the impact of infestation versus presence of zebra mussels with experiments in the laboratory and (2) collect data on glycogen concentrations of unionid mussels at field sites with and without zebra mussels. In the experiment, tissue samples were collected after 30 days from treatment tanks where (1) Threeridge (Amblema plicata) were artificially infested with zebra mussels, (2) zebra mussels were present with similar biomass, but shells of A. plicata were not infested, and (3) control tanks where zebra mussels were absent. Results from the experiments showed zebra mussel presence and infestation reduced glycogen by 38% and 66%, respectively. Results from the field were consistent with these findings. Variation in glycogen concentrations of mussels collected in the field was best explained by chlorophyll-a concentrations (coarse measure of food resource) and zebra mussel densities. Zebra mussels showed similar detrimental effects as in other studies despite their lower densities, which could be due to the additional metabolic costs associated with higher water temperatures. Our study suggests that the combined impact of invasive species and rising temperatures due to global warming needs to be considered for conservation and management plans.

T1  - DNA damage as indicator of the environmental vulnerability of bats in Brazil’s Caatinga drylands
AN  - 2638858201
AB  - Brazil’s Caatinga drylands is under extensive environmental deterioration, with 38% of its natural cover already lost. There is a need for a better understanding of the effects of such degradation on Caatinga’s rich and singular biota. Bats form a large part of this biota, and are pointed as good bioindicators. Here, we used the micronucleus test –an easy-to-use, accessible and cost-effective in vivo approach– to detect DNA damage in cells from bats of different species and feeding habits in three protected areas in the Caatinga, comparing them with samples from an industrial sugarcane plantation. We hypothesized that environmental disturbance would reflect in DNA damage, with lower levels of damage in the less disturbed protected areas. The frequency of micronucleated cells differed significantly between sites and feeding habits (carnivores > insectivores > frugivores > nectarivores > hematophagous) but did not differ between sexes. Alarmingly, the highest levels of DNA damage were in two strictly protected areas (Seridó and Raso da Catarina Ecological Stations). Glossophaga and Anoura were the genera with more damaged cells, and had, respectively, 1.48 and 3.53 times more micronucleated cells (average of 19.33 and 22.67 cells, respectively) than individuals from the same genera from the area with least damaged cells (average of 7.80 and 5.00 cells, respectively). Our analysis is a warning call for an in-depth investigation on the effects of both genotoxic contamination and environmental stressors on bats and other species in Brazil’s Caatinga, including the role that historical human-induced processes –like the intense use of agrochemicals– may have had in the region.

T1  - Creating informed consumers of aquatic invasive species management programs through online education for nonprofessionals
AN  - 2661415817
AB  - There are limited educational opportunities regarding aquatic invasive species (AIS) management that target laypersons. This is a significant gap, particularly as nonprofessionals are often tasked with making decisions about whether and how to pursue AIS control efforts, for example, through their roles in community lake associations. Thus, there is a need for educational programs to help consumers of AIS management services, “do-it-yourself” lakeshore homeowners, and other engaged nonprofessionals gain a stronger foundation in the science and practice of AIS management. We helped fill this unmet need through development of a new online course, AIS Management 101, that targets lakeshore property owners, lake association members, and other nonprofessionals engaged in AIS decision making, seeking to make them better-informed consumers. The course covers concepts ranging from basic invasive species biology to pesticide science, treatment evaluation, regulations and permitting, and nonchemical management tools. Participants in the course demonstrated significant knowledge gains through check-in and check-out knowledge assessments. Course participants also reported greater understanding of key issues pertaining to AIS management and application of this improved knowledge to actual management decisions following completion of the course. While this program focuses on management of aquatic invasive species, similar approaches could be applied to lay audiences engaged in management of terrestrial invasive species or other natural resource issues.

T1  - Physical Circulation in the Coastal Zone of a Large Lake Controls the Benthic Biological Distribution
AN  - 2644026216
AB  - Gradients of conductivity and major ions in the coastal zone of the eastern Georgian Bay of Lake Huron appear to limit the spatial distribution of invasive dreissenid mussels. Rivers flowing into Georgian Bay from the Canadian Shield have relatively low conductivity compared to the main body of Lake Huron, which creates a gradient of solutes near the river mouths. Field observations show a strong positive correlation between conductivity and calcium concentration. Thus, we use conductivity to infer the calcium concentrations required for the successful growth of dreissenid mussels. Most dreissenid mussels were observed in regions where specific conductivities were greater than 140 μS/cm. Field observations were used to examine how the calcium poor river water mixes within the coastal zone, resulting in solute gradients that determine mussel distribution. When river flows are low in late summer, there is only a weak solute gradient across the coastal zone, implying an intrusion of open bay waters into the shallow embayments, that favor the growth of dreissenid mussels. In contrast, during spring when river flows are as much as 10 times higher, there is a strong solute gradient that extends further into the lake, and the low calcium appears to limit the growth of dreissenid mussels. Thus, the seasonal character of solute gradients helps describe the spatial distribution of dreissenid mussels and explains the localized absence of a species that is otherwise prevalent in much of the Laurentian Great Lakes.

T1  - The alien octocoral <i>Carijoa riisei</i> is a biogenic substrate multiplier in artificial Brazilian shipwrecks
AN  - 2634667550
AB  - Despite the obvious negative effects caused by invasive species, some recent studies have shown that the impacts at local scale are diverse and not necessarily negative. Arborescent benthic organisms such as octocorals form three-dimensional structures capable of increasing the amount of substrate available and providing shelter for epibiont species. We investigated the role of the alien octocoral Carijoa riisei on the diversity of benthic communities in three shipwrecks on the north-eastern coast of Brazil. We expected that (a) the fauna associated with the octocoral are richer and more diverse compared to the adjacent; (b) some species are exclusively associated with C. riisei; (c) the species that are present both in the areas with and without C. riisei have a greater abundance when associated with the octocoral. For this, we compared the macrobenthic communities associated with C. riisei to those found in adjacent areas where the octocoral was absent. Our study showed that the communities associated with the octocoral were 1.5 times richer and 10 times more abundant than adjacent communities, with 29 exclusive taxa. The dominant taxa were the amphipods Ericthonius brasiliensis and Podocerus brasiliensis and polychaetes of the family Syllidae. These taxa were present in areas with presence and absence of C. riisei, but their abundance was significantly greater where the octocoral was present. Our results reinforce the idea that Carijoa riisei acts as an ecosystem engineer in coastal reefs, creating new habitats and increasing diversity at a local scale, even though it is an alien species.

T1  - Trends and potential human health risk of trace elements accumulated in transplanted blue mussels during restoration activities of Flekkefjord fjord (Southern Norway)
AN  - 2631749674
AB  - The monitoring of contaminants represents a priority to preserve the integrity of marine ecosystems, as well as to plan and to manage restoration activities in order to protect environmental and human health. In the present study, a 6-months active biomonitoring was performed to explore the levels of eighteen trace and toxic elements, including heavy metals (TEs; i.e. Al, As, Ca, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, P, Pb, Sr, Ti, and Zn), accumulated in soft tissues of blue mussel (Mytilus edulis Linnaeus, 1758) individuals transplanted at different depths (5- and 15-m depth) in five locations within the Flekkefjord fjord (Southern Norway). As this area suffered a long-lasting contamination due to both organic and inorganic contaminants, a series of restoration activities were activated to tackle and to prevent potential risks for ecosystem and local population. Our results demonstrated that the levels of TEs accumulated in edible tissues of transplanted mussels in the Flekkefjord fjord were generally low before the beginning of the restoration activities. However, location- and time-specific differences in the accumulation of TEs were noted after the implementation of such activities. Interestingly, the levels of Fe and Mn significantly increased after the beginning of the restoration activities, likely because the release of these TEs from the slag used in such operations and/or resuspension of contaminated sediments. However, assuming that native mussels can accumulate the same TEs at levels measured in transplanted individuals, our results suggest a substantial safety for human consumption of native mussels from the Flekkefjord fjord, regardless of restoration activities.

AB  - The objective of this study was to identify correlations between environmental variables and cyanobacterial diversity, succession and dominance in three Australian water supply reservoirs. We assessed up to 15 years of in-lake water quality monitoring data from Lake Wivenhoe and Lake Tingalpa (Queensland), and Lake Myponga (South Australia). Lakes Wivenhoe and Tingalpa, subject to a subtropical climate, had higher cyanobacterial richness than Lake Myponga in temperate South Australia. Richness in the subtropical lakes was positively correlated (P < 0.05) with total cyanobacteria biomass, and cyanobacteria biovolume > 0.03 mm3/l (Alert level 1; World Health Organization) was often composed of multiple cyanobacteria species. Peaks in total cyanobacteria biomass and diversity occurred in all three lakes from late spring to early autumn. Unicellular picocyanobacterial dominance was negatively correlated (P < 0.05) with total nitrogen while dominance of colonial and filamentous species with larger cells (e.g. Microcystis spp., Raphidiopsis spp., Dolichospermum circinale) was positively correlated (P < 0.05) with total phosphorus. Among the species with larger cells, diazotrophic D. circinale often dominated when total nitrogen was at low concentrations. Our results support decision making for selecting cyanoHAB control strategies based on single- or multi-species dominance and reinforce that new monitoring technologies could support species-level assessments.

T1  - Sublethal Effects of Biogenic Silver Nanoparticles and Silver Nitrate in the Neotropical Fish <i>Prochilodus lineatus</i>: Is the Nanoform Really Less Toxic?
AN  - 2630554031
AB  - Abstract Biogenic silver nanoparticles (bNAg) have been suggested as a less toxic alternative to ionic silver (Ag), and also a more ecological alternative to synthetic silver nanoparticles (sNAg). However, the differences between the sublethal effects caused by bNAg and silver nitrate (AgNO3) are hardly known, especially in native fishes of the Neotropical region. Most researchers have only compared the effects of sNAg and AgNO3. Thus, the objective of this work was to evaluate the effects of bNAg, produced by the fungus Fusarium oxysporum, and to compare these with the effects of AgNO3 in the Neotropical fish Prochilodus lineatus. The animals were exposed for 24 and 96 h at nominal concentrations of 10 and 25 µg L−1 of Ag. At the end of the exposures, Ag accumulation, metallothionein concentration, hematological parameters, plasma glucose and ion concentrations, activity of the main ATPases and carbonic anhydrase in the gills, enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants, lipid peroxidation, and neurotoxic effects were evaluated. Both bNAg and AgNO3 caused Ag accumulation in the blood, gills, and brain, in addition to neurotoxic effects on muscle, alterations in reduced glutathione concentration in the gills, and increased glutathione-S-transferase activity in the liver. Hyperglycemia, ionic imbalances, and alterations in the activity of ion transport enzymes in the gills were also observed. As the effects of bNAg were similar to the effects of AgNO3, it is concluded that animals exposed to the highest concentration of silver were the most affected, regardless of the form of silver used in the exposure medium.

T1  - Invasive Dreissena Mussel Coastal Transport From an Already Invaded Estuary to a Nearby Archipelago Detected in DNA and Zooplankton Surveys
AN  - 2631371246
AB  - Coastal waters of Lake Superior are generally inhospitable to the establishment of invasive Dreissena spp. mussels (both D. polymorpha and D. bugensis). Dreissena have inhabited the Saint Louis River estuary (SLRE; largest commercial port in the Laurentian Great Lakes) for over 3 decades, but only in the last few years have small colonies been found in the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore (APIS), an archipelago situated 85 km to the east of SLRE) A 2017 survey determined a low abundance Dreissena spatial distribution in APIS, with the largest colonies on the north and west islands which suggested potential veliger transport from the SLRE via longshore currents. Our objective in this study was to determine if Dreissena veligers are transported by currents at low densities along the south shore of Lake Superior from the SLRE to APIS. To do so, we used both eDNA (water and passive substrate samples) and zooplankton collection methods at 8 sites evenly spaced between the SLRE and APIS with 3 sampling times over 5 weeks. Dreissena veligers were consistently detected along the south shore, although at low abundances (veligers per m3 range=0 – 690, median=8), and for every 1 km increase in distance from the SLRE, both veliger counts and water eDNA copy numbers decreased on average by 5% and 7%, respectively. D. polymorpha (suited to estuary habitats) was detected 2 times more than D. bugensis (better suited to deep-lake habitats). There was not a trend in the veliger size distribution along the south shore, and temperature and calcium concentrations fluctuated around the threshold for Dreissena veliger and adult development, averaging 11.0 ℃ and 14.8 ppm, respectively. Three zooplankton taxa representative of the estuary community--Daphnia retrocurva, Diaphanosoma birgei, and Mesocyclops copepodites--decreased as the distance from the SLRE increased mirroring Dreissena veliger abundance patterns. Findings represent multiple sources of evidence of a propagule “conveyor belt” for Dreissena along the south shore of Lake Superior. We conclude that veligers are functioning as a propagule, using coastal currents to spread from the point of invasion, thereby traversing coastal habitat previously reported as inhospitable to distant habitats suitable for colonization.

T1  - Development of a Binary Digestion System for Extraction Microplastics in Fish and Detection Method by Optical Photothermal Infrared
AN  - 2627870584
AB  - Accumulating evidence indicates that aquatic organisms ingest microplastics (MPs), which may be a threat to essentially the entire global ecosystem. In current detection methods, even in cutting-edge nanoplastic technology, a major challenge for detecting microplastics (MPs) in aquatic organisms is removing complex biological matrices, such as fat. Herein we report combining HNO3 and H2O2 to form a binary digestive reagent system to determine MPs in biological tissue. With insights obtained from a Gaussian model, the adding manners of two reagents were discussed. Thus, in the final protocol, we mixed MPs and tissue with 20 mL of 30% (v/v) aqueous H2O2, 10 mL 0.5 M NaOH,1 mL 5 mM Fe2+, and 40 mL 11.5% (v/v) aqueous HNO3, in sequence at different time intervals. What’s more, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and ultrasound—alone or together—were explored to solve the problem of removing fat residues and thus membrane blockage during filtration. In this paper, we used the O-PTIR microscope to verify the feasibility of the protocol. Compared with traditional detection methods, the O-PTIR spectroscopy can significantly improve the lateral resolution, down to sub and super-micrometer, and the ability to quickly obtain high spatial resolution far-field non-contact infrared spectra, which provide a novel method for qualitative analysis of MPs. In field applications, in our attempt, the fixed wavenumber image by O-PTIR can realize sub and super-micrometer MPs in-situ, far-field measurements. The present method is highly efficient, and facilitates the identification of plastic particles.

T1  - General structure of Nereids of the East Coast of Algeria
AN  - 2640800157
AB  - The study of biodiversity of nereids at three sites (El-Kala, Annaba and Skikda) of the Algerian east coast for the year of 2018 has allowed us to identify 8 species belonging to the family of Nereididae: Perínereis cultrifera, Perinereis floridana, Perinereis oliveirae, Perinereis macropus, Perinereis marionii, Platynereis dumerilli and Nereis falsa. The aim of this study was to carry out the analysis of the specific richness and the abundance of annelids in order to determine their biodiversity where the structure and functioning of these communities were analyzed. Moreover, the analysis of the ecological indices shows a less rich biodiversity at the two sites (Annaba and Skikda). Physico-chemical parameter data show significant differences between the three sites especially for dissolved oxygen.

T1  - Listening with the invasive fish ear: applications and innovations of otolith chemistry analysis in invasive fish biology
AN  - 2632031809
AB  - Acquisition of biological information on invasive fishes during the early stages of invasion could be critical in orienting subsequent management strategies. To achieve such a task, biological invasion researchers and practitioners take advantage of numerous technologies (e.g. genomics and acoustic telemetry). Surprisingly, the study of invasive fish ecology by analysis of the chemical composition of calcium carbonate hard parts (e.g. otoliths and scales) remains underutilized, despite some convincing examples of successful applications in the scientific literature. Among its most common applications in invasion biology, otolith chemistry has been used to identify natal origins, reconstruct migratory behaviour and assess mixed-stock structure. In this literature review, we provide a general overview of those previous applications but more importantly identify some gaps and obstacles to applications of otolith chemistry in invasion biology and suggest development for innovative applications, including use in wildlife forensic sciences and reconstruction of the early dynamics of invasions.

T1  - Evaluating essential processes and forecast requirements for meteotsunami-induced coastal flooding
AN  - 2631381218
AB  - Meteotsunamis pose a unique threat to coastal communities and often lead to damage of coastal infrastructure, deluge of nearby property, and loss of life and injury. The Great Lakes are a known hot-spot of meteotsunami activity and serve as an important region for investigation of essential hydrodynamic processes and model forecast requirements in meteotsunami-induced coastal flooding. For this work, we developed an advanced hydrodynamic model and evaluate key model attributes and dynamic processes, including: (1) coastal model grid resolution and wetting and drying process in low-lying zones, (2) coastal infrastructure, including breakwaters and associated submerging and overtopping processes, (3) annual/seasonal (ambient) water level change, and (4) wind wave-current coupling. Numerical experiments are designed to evaluate the importance of these attributes to meteotsunami modeling, including a “representative storm” scenario in the context of regional climate change in which a meteotsunami wave is generated under high ambient lake-level conditions with a preferable wind direction and speed for wind-wave growth. Results demonstrate that accurate representation of coastal topography and fully resolving associated hydrodynamic processes are critical to forecasting the realistic hazards associated with meteotsunami events. As most of existing coastal forecast systems generally do not resolve many of these features due to insufficient model grid resolution or lack of essential model attributes, this work shows that calibrating or assessing existing forecast models against coastal water level gauges alone may result in underestimating the meteotsunami hazard, particularly when gauging stations are sparse and located behind harbor breakwaters or inside estuaries, which represent dampened or otherwise unrepresentative pictures of meteotsunami intensity. This work is the first hydrodynamic modeling of meteotsunami-induced coastal flooding for the Great Lakes, and serves as a template to guide where resources may be most beneficial in forecast system development and implementation.

T1  - Contribution of invasive bivalves (<i>Dreissena</i> spp.) to element distribution: phase interaction, regional and seasonal comparison in a large shallow lake
AN  - 2631380801
AB  - After introduction, the invasive bivalve dreissenids became key species in the biota of Lake Balaton, the largest shallow lake in Central Europe. The contribution of dreissenid soft tissue and shell, as biotic phases, in element distribution and its interaction with the water and upper sediment phases were examined in two basins with different trophic conditions in spring and autumn. Six metals (Ba, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb, Zn) were detected in all investigated phases. In general, metals were abundant in the water and soft tissue in the eastern basin in spring, and in the sediment and shells in the western basin in autumn. This might be associated with the more urbanized surroundings in the eastern, and the enhanced organic matter production in the western basin. High relative shares of Ba, Cu, Mn, and Pb were associated with the water and shell samples, whereas high shares of Fe and Zn were noted in the soft mussel tissue and sediments. Results suggest that dynamics of metal uptake by dreissenids depend on the seasonal change in metabolic activity. Shell metal content is less changeable; shells might absorb metals from both the soft tissue and water phases. Metallothionein peptides, the scavengers of intracellular metals, were determined to be biomarkers of the bulk contaminants rather than only metals. The present study shows that invasive bivalves, with high abundance, filtering activity, and storing capacity can significantly contribute to element distribution in the shoreline of a shallow lake ecosystem.

T1  - Local adaptation mediates direct and indirect effects of multiple stressors on consumer fitness
AN  - 2630688901
AB  - Anthropogenic impacts are expected to increase the co-occurrence of stressors that can fundamentally alter ecosystem structure and function. To cope with stress, many organisms locally adapt, but how such adaptations affect the ability of an organism to manage co-occurring stressors is not well understood. In aquatic ecosystems, elevated temperatures and harmful algal blooms are common co-stressors. To better understand the role and potential trade-offs of local adaptations for mitigating the effects of stressors, Daphnia pulicaria genotypes that varied in their ability to consume toxic cyanobacteria prey (i.e., three tolerant and three sensitive) were exposed to five diets that included combinations of toxic cyanobacteria, Microcystis aeruginosa, and a green alga, Ankistrodesmus falcatus, under two temperatures (20 °C vs. 28 °C). A path analysis was conducted to understand how local adaptations affect energy allocation to intermediate life history traits (i.e., somatic growth, fecundity, survival) that maximize Daphnia fitness (i.e., population growth rate). Results from the 10-day study show that tolerant Daphnia genotypes had higher fitness than sensitive genotypes regardless of diet or temperature treatment, suggesting toxic cyanobacteria tolerance did not cause a decrease in fitness in the absence of cyanobacteria or under elevated temperatures. Results from the path analysis demonstrated that toxic cyanobacteria had a stronger effect on life history traits than temperature and that population growth rate was mainly constrained by reduced fecundity. These findings suggest that local adaptations to toxic cyanobacteria and elevated temperatures are synergistic, leading to higher survivorship of cyanobacteria-tolerant genotypes during summer cyanobacterial bloom events.

T1  - Microplastics in mangroves and coral reef ecosystems: a review
AN  - 2628901455
AB  - Microplastic pollution has recently been identified as a major issue for the health of ecosystems. Microplastics have typically sizes of less than 5 mm and occur in various forms, such as pellets, fibres, fragments, films, and granules. Mangroves and coral reefs are sensitive and restricted ecosystems that provide free ecological services such as coastal protection, maintaining natural cycles, hotspots of biodiversity and economically valuable goods. However, urbanization and industrial activities have started contaminating even these preserved ecosystems. Here we review sources, occurrence, and toxicity of microplastics in the trophic levels of mangrove and coral reef ecosystems. We present detection methods, such as microscopic identification and spectroscopy. We discuss mitigating measures that prevent the entry of microplastics into the marine environment.

T1  - Variable changes in zooplankton phenology associated with the disappearance of the spring phytoplankton bloom in Lake Michigan
AN  - 2624523094
AB  - Changes in seasonal cycles (i.e., phenology), can cause mismatches throughout aquatic food webs and often are used as the primary indicator of zooplankton response to environmental changes. However, zooplankton phenology has been largely overlooked in Lake Michigan despite the altered phenology of phytoplankton, including the disappearance of the offshore spring phytoplankton bloom following Dreissena mussel invasions.Multiple measures of phenology were evaluated for the major zooplankton groups in offshore southeastern Lake Michigan both before the loss of the spring bloom (1983–2003), and after the spring bloom had disappeared (2007–2019). Water temperatures in spring did not differ between time periods.Standardised biomass declined between time periods for all zooplankton groups in spring and for total zooplankton and the cladoceran Daphnia in the summer. Changes in zooplankton phenology varied across groups and depended on the phenological measures used. Month of peak biomass shifted later for all groups, but the central point of the growing season did not change for any group between time periods. The onset of population development was delayed only for the copepod Limnocalanus.Spring chlorophyll concentrations combined with spring water temperatures provided the best predictions of population onset for Limnocalanus and Daphnia. The central point of the growing season varied with spring chlorophyll concentrations for Limnocalanus, but with spring water temperature for Daphnia.Changes in zooplankton phenology were relatively subtle compared to the large changes observed for spring chlorophyll concentrations. By contrast, there were fairly consistent declines in zooplankton biomass across groups that were associated with the declines in spring chlorophyll either alone or in combination with spring water temperature. This may mean that food limitation has a stronger influence on zooplankton biomass or production than on zooplankton phenology in offshore Lake Michigan.Based on our results from Lake Michigan, alterations such as nutrient reduction or invasive dreissenid mussel filtering that lead to declines in spring phytoplankton blooms in other large freshwater lakes could result in subtle delays in zooplankton phenology for some groups along with stronger declines in zooplankton biomass.

T1  - Does the freshwater mussel <i>Anodonta anatina</i> remove the fish pathogen <i>Flavobacterium columnare</i> from water?
AN  - 2622860735
AB  - Global decline of freshwater mussels (Unionoida) is threatening biodiversity and the essential ecosystem services that mussels provide. As filter-feeding organisms, freshwater mussels remove phytoplankton and suspended particles from the water. By filtering bacteria, freshwater mussels also decrease pathogen loads in the water. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether the common freshwater bivalve Anodonta anatina (duck mussel) could remove the bacterial fish pathogen Flavobacterium columnare from the water. Mussels reduced bacteria in both of the two experiments performed, so that the bacterial concentration at the end of the 96-h monitoring in mussel treatments was only 0.3–0.5 times that of the controls. Surprisingly, mussels did not reduce algal cell concentration statistically significantly. Mussel behavior (shell openness, foot position, and movement) was not affected by the presence of bacteria or algae, except for biodeposition formation, which was greatest in algal-fed treatments, followed by bacterial-fed treatments and controls, respectively. The intestines of bacteria-incubated A. anatina harbored F. columnare, suggesting that mussels ingested the bacteria. Present results suggest that freshwater mussels may also have a potential to mitigate aquaculture pathogen problems, as well as play a role in water quality management.

T1  - Grazing impacts on phytoplankton in South American water ecosystems: a synthesis
AN  - 2622860387
AB  - The role of grazing as a controlling factor of phytoplankton has an extensive debate in the literature. In this article, five mechanisms that have been explored as potential controlling factors of grazing influence on phytoplankton in South America are discussed and compared with other latitudinal works. The temperature impact on zooplankton is not conclusive, with planktivorous fish appearing as the main controlling factor of zooplankton size ranges. Fish grazing effects on phytoplankton look despicable, but the impact of exotic filter-feeding fish remains controversial. Microphagous rotifers and Copepoda nauplii affect phytoplankton by selective size grazing, while large Cladocera and Copepoda adults can control phytoplankton when they reach high densities in the absence of fish. Both groups mainly feed on small sizes, with microzooplankton having a higher impact on very small phytoplankton. Some contradictory evidence arises for large colonial and filamentous algae. Exotic invasive filter-feeding bivalves are selective grazers in experimental approximations. Corbicula fluminea feeds on smaller particles, does not have taxonomic preferences, and has lower densities in nature than Limnoperna fortunei. Their effect on nature is not fully documented. In sum, several aspects still need deep scrutiny to fully understand the role of grazing on phytoplankton in South America.

T1  - Behavioural responses to con- and heterospecific alarm cues by an alien and a coexisting native fish
AN  - 2622860275
AB  - The monkey goby Neogobius fluviatilis is an invasive Ponto-Caspian fish that enters habitats of the native gudgeon Gobio gobio in European freshwaters, likely belonging to the same prey guild. Their abilities to detect and avoid predation have been poorly understood, although these traits may contribute to the competitive advantage and drive the invasion success of the goby. We tested intra- and interspecific responses of fish from sympatric populations to damage-released alarm cues (skin extract) in laboratory. Both species of fish responded to conspecific and heterospecific cues, but their responses to conspecifics were more diverse (changed social distancing among individuals, reduced vertical and horizontal movement) than those elicited by heterospecifics (changed social distancing only). Moreover, the fish differed in their anti-predation behaviour: the gudgeon increased whilst the monkey goby decreased inter-individual distances and only the gudgeon exhibited thigmotaxis and reduced mobility in response to the conspecific cues. Interspecific differences show that the species exhibit distant anti-predation strategies. This might be associated with their phylogenetic distance and/or higher differentiation of their ecological niches than commonly assumed. Besides, our results suggest that alien species be included in the interspecific exchange of information in local fish assemblages.

T1  - Batch Kinetic Studies of Pharmaceutical Compounds Removal Using Activated Sludge Obtained from a Membrane Bioreactor
AN  - 2620907579
AB  - Abstract Pharmaceutical compounds are emerging pollutants found in the wastewater, which have recently drawn general concerns due to their potential to affect the quality of water bodies, ecosystems, and human health. The purpose of this paper was to assess the removal mechanisms sorption and biodegradation of two lipid regulator pharmaceutical compounds, clofibric acid (CLA) and gemfibrozil (GFZ), through batch experiments using activated sludge obtained from a membrane bioreactor (MBR). As a result, biodegradation was the main removal mechanism in activated sludge for both pharmaceutical compounds, followed by sorption and desorption. The highest removals of CLA and GFZ were 72 and 97%, respectively. According to results from the adsorption test, the CLA and GFZ have a strong adsorption capacity on inactivated biomass. The solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd) for CLA was 8.5 L·g−1 and for GFZ was 0.75 L·g−1. The value for Monod constants qmax was 0.6 h−1 for both pharmaceutical compounds. The affinity constant Ks value of CLA (4.37 µg.L−1) was higher than the Ks value of GFZ (0.35 µg·L−1). COD and NH4–N removals were 99 and 97%, respectively, during the kinetic test.

T1  - Modelling the abundance of a non-native mollusk in tropical semi-arid reservoirs
AN  - 2620838369
AB  - This study aimed to investigate the relative importance of abiotic factors and biotic resistance (expressed as species richness of native macroinvertebrates), through a correlative niche-based model, to explain the abundance of the non-native mollusk Melanoides tuberculata. A total of 478 sites were sampled in six reservoirs in a Brazilian semi-arid region in June, September, December (2014) and March (2015). A niche-based model (BRT's), which included all tested predictor variables explained 41.7% total variation in M. tuberculata abundance. Water depth had the highest relative importance (19.0% of relative contribution) followed by temperature (17.2%) and sediment organic matter content (15.4%). The native macroinvertebrate richness explained only 8.0%, evidencing the smaller role of biotic resistance in explaining M. tuberculata abundance. Our results suggest that factors associated with the extent of species’ niches are more important and can determine the multiple invasion processes of this mollusk, especially in terms of population growth and spread. The low explanatory power of biotic resistance on the abundance and distribution of the invasive mollusk may not necessarily indicate a lack of resistance by the native community, and M. tuberculata is not widespread enough to occupy the total potential range.

T1  - Spatio-temporal and intra-specific variations in the physiological and biochemical condition of the invasive bivalve <i>Corbicula fluminea</i>
AN  - 2620837694
AB  - Corbicula fluminea is a known aquatic invasive species responsible for several ecological and economic impacts. In Portugal, it is found in all major watersheds, although to varying degrees of invasion (regarding density, biomass and spatial distribution). The aim of this study was to evaluate the spatio-temporal differences in condition indices (CIs) and biochemical composition (proteins, lipids and energy) of individuals collected in Lima (low invasion) and Minho (high invasion) Rivers, as well as the effects of intra-specific competition (densities: 150, 500, 1000 individuals/m2) on the CIs of C. fluminea. CIs and biochemical composition varied between rivers and over time, with populations in Lima and Minho showing different patterns. Corbicula fluminea in Lima River had higher CIs and lower densities with more individuals of larger size, while individuals in Minho River had lower CIs and high densities with a more uniform size distribution. The intra-specific competition experiment showed that the optimum of C. fluminea was reached at 500 individuals/m2 density, possibly related to the species ability of enrich sediments with organic matter, leading to a positive feedback on phytoplankton and/or microbial communities. This study improves the understanding of the ecophysiological conditions of C. fluminea populations, a topic neglected in previous studies.

T1  - Determination of the pharmaceuticals–nano/microplastics in aquatic systems by analytical and instrumental methods
AN  - 2619341504
AB  - Pharmaceutical residues and nanoplastic and microplastic particles as emerging pollutants in the aquatic environment are a subject of increasing concern in terms of the effect on water sources and marine organisms. There is lack of information about pharmaceutical–nanoplastic and pharmaceutical–microplastic mixtures. The present study aimed to investigate the fate and effect of pharmaceutical residues and nanoplastic and microplastic particles, the results of combinations of pharmaceutical residues with nanoplastic and microplastic particles, and toxic effects of pharmaceutical residues and nanoplastic and microplastic particles. Moreover, the objective was also to introduce analytical methods for pharmaceuticals, along with instrumental techniques for nanoplastic and microplastic particles in aquatic environments and organisms. PhAC alone can affect marine environments and aquatic organisms. When pharmaceutical residues combine with nanoplastic and microplastic particles, the rate of toxicity increases, and the result of this phenomenon constitutes this kind of pollutant in wastewater. Hence, the rate of mortality in organisms enhances. This study aimed to investigate the effect of pharmaceuticals residues and nanoplastic and microplastic particles, and a mixture of pharmaceutical residues and nanoplastic and microplastic particles in aquatic biota. Another object was survey methods for recognizing pharmaceutical residues and nanoplastic and microplastic particles. The findings show that pharmaceutical residues in organisms caused cell structure damage, inflammatory response, and nerve cell apoptosis. This study aimed to investigate the effect of microplastic particles in the human food chain and their impact on human health. Moreover, this review aims to present an innovative methodology based on comprehensive analytical techniques used to determine and identify pharmaceuticals adsorbed on nano- and microplastics in aquatic ecosystems. Finally, this review addresses the knowledge gaps and provides insights into future research strategies to better understand their interactions.

T1  - Experimental Analysis of Survival and Recovery of Ship Fouling Mussels During Transit Between Marine and Freshwaters
AN  - 2620899268
AB  - Ships and boats may transport whole communities of non-indigenous species through hull biofouling, some members of which may become invasive. Several studies have evaluated the diversity of these communities, but very few have analyzed the survival of organisms after their voyages into different and potentially inhospitable conditions. This factor is important to consider because the last port of call approach for risk assessments assumes that if the conditions observed in the last port of call are different from those observed in a receiving port, risks are diminished or null. Using an innovative experimental system, we tested the survival and recovery of the marine blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) and the freshwater zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) by exposing them to adverse salinity conditions at varying temperatures to simulate ships and boats transiting to ports or marinas with contrasting environmental conditions. Both mussel species, which are well-known for their adaptability to new environments as aquatic non-indigenous species, survived better at colder temperatures, with blue mussels surviving up to 14 days in freshwater, and zebra mussels up to 8 days in marine water. This highlights the importance of considering the resistance of fouling organisms to adverse conditions in vector and species risk assessments.

T1  - Climate and Land Use Driven Ecosystem Homogenization in the Prairie Pothole Region
AN  - 2724298773
AB  - The homogenization of freshwater ecosystems and their biological communities has emerged as a prevalent and concerning phenomenon because of the loss of ecosystem multifunctionality. The millions of prairie-pothole wetlands scattered across the Prairie Pothole Region (hereafter PPR) provide critical ecosystem functions at local, regional, and continental scales. However, an estimated loss of 50% of historical wetlands and the widespread conversion of grasslands to cropland make the PPR a heavily modified landscape. Therefore, it is essential to understand the current and potential future stressors affecting prairie-pothole wetland ecosystems in order to conserve and restore their functions. Here, we describe a conceptual model that illustrates how (a) historical wetland losses, (b) anthropogenic landscape modifications, and (c) climate change interact and have altered the variability among remaining depressional wetland ecosystems (i.e., ecosystem homogenization) in the PPR. We reviewed the existing literature to provide examples of wetland ecosystem homogenization, provide implications for wetland management, and identify informational gaps that require further study. We found evidence for spatial, hydrological, chemical, and biological homogenization of prairie-pothole wetlands. Our findings indicate that the maintenance of wetland ecosystem multifunctionality is dependent on the preservation and restoration of heterogenous wetland complexes, especially the restoration of small wetland basins.

T1  - An Eco-Study for a Feasible Project: “Torun and Its Vistula Stretch—An Important Green Navigation Spot on a Blue Inland Waterway”
AN  - 2724290641
AB  - This paper aims to present the main trends of an eco-study for a possibly challenging future inland waterway transportation project. The study will prove if Torun and its Vistula stretch represent a viable and profitable spot on this inland waterway, and its outcomes will constitute a sound baseline that can be used for the project itself but also for many scientific, educational and economic purposes. The eco-multilayer research will comprise the following elements: hydrology and biology of the Torunian Vistula (TV) stretch, and water quality; a public opinion survey; the urban functions of the TV segment (social, educational, urban planning, aesthetical, recreational, cultural, utilitarian and economical). The conclusion is that the eco-research and the project will improve Torun City’s image as a Green Urban Space, in terms of respect towards the environment, a sustainable form of transport, and attractive ways of relaxation and spending leisure time by Torun’s population and visitors. The eco-study and the project will contribute to promoting the Torun region by supporting the possibility of watching beautiful landscapes (sightseeing tours) spread along the Vistula River. The project itself will have a positive impact on the Torunian economy and on the lifestyle of Torun’s citizens.

T1  - Analysis and Modeling of Sunscreen Ingredients’ Behavior in an Aquatic Environment
AN  - 2716584552
AB  - Sunscreens have become a product based on increasingly complex formulations that include, among many ingredients, a mixture of UV filters to provide optimal sun ultraviolet radiation protection. A significant group of scientific works deals with the impact of UV filters in aquatic media. However, the knowledge of the mechanism and kinetics of the compound’s direct release, fate, and its transformation and interaction with living organisms is necessary to assess its environmental occurrence and behavior and to predict potential and real impacts on the aquatic environment. This review outlines the existing analysis and modeling of the release and behavior of sunscreen’s ingredients in the marine environment, including aquatic organisms. The physical-chemical properties, photodegradation, and release kinetics of particles and chemicals into the water are studied by hydrodynamic and kinetic models. Direct photolysis of chemicals is modeled as pseudo-first-order kinetics, while the indirect pathway by the reaction of sunscreen with reactive oxygen species is described as second-order kinetics. The interaction of UV filters with marine biota is studied mainly by toxicokinetic models, which predict their bio-accumulation in the organisms’ tissues. These models consider the chemicals’ uptake and excretion, as well as their transfer between different internal animal organs, as a first-order kinetic process. The studies analyzed in the present work represent a driver of change for the beauty and personal care industry, in order to seek new ecological alternatives through the application of R&D tactics.

T1  - Cyanobacterial Bloom Phenology in Green Bay Using MERIS Satellite Data and Comparisons with Western Lake Erie and Saginaw Bay
AN  - 2711500840
AB  - Cyanobacteria blooms have been reported to be increasing worldwide. In addition to potentially causing major economic and ecological damage, these blooms can threaten human health. Furthermore, these blooms can be exacerbated by a warming climate. One approach to monitoring and modeling cyanobacterial biomass is to use processed satellite imagery to obtain long-term data sets. In this paper, an existing algorithm for estimating cyanobacterial biomass previously developed for MERIS is validated for Green Bay using cyanobacteria biovolume estimates obtained from field samples. Once the algorithm was validated, the existing MERIS imagery was used to determine the bloom phenology of the cyanobacterial biomass in Green Bay. Modeled datasets of heat flux (as a proxy for stratification), wind speed, water temperature, and gelbstoff absorption along with in situ river discharge data were used to separate bloom seasons in Green Bay from bloom seasons in nearby cyanobacteria bloom hotspots including western Lake Erie and Saginaw Bay. Of the ten-year MERIS dataset used here, the highest five years were considered “high bloom” years, and the lowest five years from biomass were considered “low bloom” years and these definitions were used to separate Green Bay. Green Bay had a strong relationship with gelbstoff absorption making it unique among the water bodies, while western Lake Erie responded strongly with river discharge as previously reported. Saginaw Bay, which has low interannual bloom variability, did not exhibit a largely influential single parameter.

T1  - Land snails Brephulopsis cylindrica and Xeropicta derbentina (Gastropoda: Stylommatophora): case study of invasive species distribution modelling
TT  - Моделирование распространения наземных моллюсков-вселенцев Brephulopsis cylindrica and Xeropicta derbentina (Gastropoda: Stylom=matophora)
AN  - 2709982579
AB  - The terrestrial snails Brephulopsis cylindrica and Xeropicta derbentina are native to steppes of the Northern Black Sea region; X. derbentina has also initially inhabited Eastern Mediterranean, the Caucasus, and Anatolia. However, in last decades the species are increasingly reported outside of their natural range which renders them as likely invasive. The paper aims to assess the ecological suitability of adjacent habitats in terms of the molluscs invasion. We address this using species distribution modelling (SDM). The selected environment predictors for SDM included 22 environment factors such as land cover, enhanced vegetation index (EVI), altitude, and 19 bioclimatic parameters. The resulted model suggests that the area with maximum suitability extends from the natural range to the Central Danube lowland in the West and up to the Volga Upland in the Northeast. These regions have similar EVI and are largely croplands. Among the predictors, the minimum temperature of the coldest month has the greatest impact on the modelling results, which agrees with the variable being the limiting factor for the distribution of subtropical invertebrates. The study reinforces the notions that X. derbentina and B. cylindrica are likely to further expand the boundaries of their range thus posing threats to native ecosystems.Alternate abstract:Наземные моллюски Brephulopsis cylindrica и Xeropicta derbentina исконно населяют степные биотопы Северного Причерноморья. Для X. derbentina нативный ареал также включает Восточное Средиземноморье, Кавказ, Малую Азию. В последние десятилетия увеличилось количество находок этих видов за пределами естественного ареала, что указывает на их инвазивный потенциал. Это обусловило необходимость оценки пригодности территорий, окружающих естественный ареал видов, и потенциально уязвимых для их инвазий. Для решения этой задачи были применены методы моделирования распространения видов (SDM). В качестве предикторов для SDM были выбраны 22 фактора окружающей среды, такие как тип земельных угодий (land cover), расширенный вегетационный индекс (EVI), высота над уровнем моря и 19 климатических параметров. Результаты моделирования показали, что зона, наиболее пригодная для обитания исследуемых видов, простирается от естественного ареала до Среднедунайской низменности на западе и до Приволжской возвышенности на северо-востоке. Эти территории имеют схожие значения EVI и преимущественно являются землями сельскохозяйственного назначения. Среди предикторов наибольшее влияние на результаты моделирования оказывает минимальная температура самого холодного месяца, что согласуется с тем, что этот фактор является лимитирующим для распространения субтропических беспозвоночных. Исследование подтверждает представления о том, что X. derbentina и B. cylindrica, вероятно, еще больше расширят границы своего ареала, создавая тем самым угрозу местным экосистемам.

T1  - Metal Content and Enrichment in Bivalves within the Drainage Area of Seawater Used for a Desulfurization Process in Zhanjiang Bay, China
AN  - 2706430544
AB  - As heavy metals are easy to accumulate and have strong biological toxicity, they pose a potential threat to human health by entering the human body through the cumulative effect of marine life. Land-based input is an important source of heavy metals in the ocean, which has a great influence on coastal water quality. In this study, the spatial distribution characteristics of heavy metals (Zn, Cu, Cd, Pb, Cr, As) in the coastal waters of the desulfurization process outlet of a power plant in Zhanjiang Bay were investigated, and the enrichment behavior of heavy metals by organisms (oysters and barnacles) were also studied. The results showed that, before the seawater desulfurization system was closed, there were high concentrations of heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb and Cr) in the surface seawater near the drainage outlet. The concentrations of these heavy metals in the surface seawater were higher than those in the bottom seawater within 100 m of the drainage outlet. After the seawater desulfurization system was closed, the average concentrations of Cu, Cr and As in seawater at each station decreased by 17.04%, 37.52% and 29.53%, respectively, while the average concentrations of Zn, Cd and Pb increased by 17.05%, 32.87% and 48.77%, respectively. Single factor pollution index (SFI) and bio-concentration factor (BCF) showed that there was a potential high accumulation risk of Zn in oysters and barnacles near the drainage outlet of desulfurization wastewater (0.5 < SFI < 1 and BCF > 1000). The SFI and BCF of each metal in oysters and barnacles decreased with the increase in distance from the drainage outlet. Generally, the coastal water quality of desulfurization process drainage area in Zhanjiang Bay were below the class Ⅱof the “Seawater quality standard” (GB 3097-1997) of China. However, the heavy metals content in seawater and organisms near the drainage outlet is slightly higher. This suggested that if the seawater desulfurization process runs for a long time, it will have a negative impact on the coastal water and organisms.

T1  - Metal contaminants of emerging concern in aquatic systems
AN  - 2705282018
AB  - The environmental concentrations and aquatic toxicity of a range of technology-critical metals comprising platinum group and rare earth group elements, together with gallium, germanium, indium, lithium, niobium, rhenium, tantalum, tellurium and thallium, have been reviewed to determine whether they pose a risk to aquatic ecosystem health. There is a reasonable body of toxicity data for most, but the quality is quite variable, and more data are required. Chronic toxicity EC10 or NOEC values are generally in the low mg L–1 range, far higher than the current environmental concentrations in the ng L–1 range, meaning that the existing risks to ecosystem health are extremely low. Missing are reliable toxicity data for niobium and tantalum, while confounding results for lanthanum toxicity need to be resolved. There is a likelihood that the currently low concentrations of most of these elements will increase in future years. Whether these concentrations are in bioavailable forms remains to be reliably determined. For most of the elements, measured speciation information is scarce, and unfortunately the thermodynamic data required to calculate their speciation are incomplete. In addition to this problem of uncertain speciation for some of these metals, notably those present in oxidation states of III or higher, there is also a need to explore the links between speciation and bioavailability for these higher valence metals. For circumneutral solutions, the calculated concentrations of the free metal ion tend to be very low for these metals and under such conditions the link between metal speciation and bioavailability is unclear.

T1  - Invasive Alien Species of Benthic Macroinvertebrates and Fish in the Bulgarian Sector of the Danube River—Results of the Joint Danube Survey 4 (JDS4)
AN  - 2700749774
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the status of aquatic invasive alien species (IAS) in the shoreline zone of the Bulgarian sector of the Danube River, Danube tributaries, and adjacent standing water bodies in the frame of the Joint Danube Survey 4 (JDS4). Seven benthic macroinvertebrates and seven fish IAS were identified. The crayfish Faxonius limosus was frequently found and abundant in the tributaries. The mussels Corbicula fluminea, Dreissena rostriformis bugensis, and Sinanodonta woodiana dominated in the Danube River and the middle and lower reaches of the tributaries, while the fish Carassius gibelio, Perccottus glenii, and Lepomis gibbosus were most abundant in the standing water bodies. The integrated biocontamination estimated by taxonomic groups (crayfish, molluscs, and fish), sampling methods, and type of water bodies ranged from moderate in the shoreline zone of the Danube River, through moderate to high in the canals and lakes, to severe in the Danube tributaries and the reservoirs. The results demonstrate the importance of IAS in the assessment of the ecological status/potential of the water bodies in the DRB. The comprehensive evaluation of the aquatic IAS pressure will provide valuable information and support for the implementation of the national and EU IAS and water policies in the DRB.

T1  - Improvement of Water Quality by Light-Emitting Diode Illumination at the Bottom of a Field Experimental Pond
AN  - 2700748713
AB  - Remediation of water quality by stimulating algal photosynthesis using light-emitting diodes (LEDs) has attracted attention, but few studies have examined this in outdoor freshwater environments. To understand the effects of LED illumination on water quality, the dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, pH, and electric conductivity were monitored over 5 months in three depressions with or without a red/blue LED light at the bottom of an experimental pond. The effects of the blue LED on water quality were evident in the period with less rainfall after the change of water quality to an equilibrium state; DO and pH were higher, and EC was lower for the blue LED than for the control. The diel changes of these variables were also lower for the blue LED. The effects of the red LED on DO and pH were also evident, but to a lesser extent compared to those of the blue LED. A vertical mixing of water associated with a nighttime cooling of the surface water was suggested by a rapid DO increase after a temperature decrease in the control. Such internal water circulation and an inflow of water after rainfall might have obscured the LED effects in the rainy period. The bottom water of the blue LED had a higher density and species richness of phytoplankton than that of the control at the end of the experiment. A lower density of phytoplankton and higher nutrient concentrations in the red LED might have been due to a higher density and feeding activity by zooplankton. Our results confirmed the applicability of LED illumination in stimulating algal photosynthesis, and in improving the oxygen condition of the bottom water in freshwater ponds.

T1  - Filamentous Algae Blooms in a Large, Clear-Water Lake: Potential Drivers and Reduced Benthic Primary Production
AN  - 2686184238
AB  - An apparent proliferation of filamentous algal blooms (FABs) in pristine lakes around the world is a source of concern. However, little is known about the predominant drivers and effects of such FABs on lake ecosystems. We observed FABs in a large clear-water lake (Bear Lake, UT/ID, USA) and analyzed long-term lake monitoring data and algal stable isotopes for changes in climate, food webs and anthropogenic nutrient loading, respectively, as potential local drivers of FAB formation. Furthermore, we quantified in situ metabolism rates on rocks with and without FABs at two locations. Long-term monitoring data revealed increasing summer water temperatures (2009 to 2020) and decreasing winter ice cover (1923 to 2021). The FABs had δ15N values that were higher than 0 ‰, indicating a potential nutrient influx to Bear Lake from livestock or human waste. Climate change and anthropogenic nutrients may thus have facilitated FAB occurrence. Contrary to expectation, the FABs exhibited significantly lower gross primary production rates compared to low-biomass periphyton communities, indicating potentially negative effects of FAB proliferations on lake food webs. Our results highlight the need for expanding lake monitoring programs to include littoral zones to detect and mitigate changes occurring in lakes.

AB  - The recent genetic revolution through the analysis of aquatic environmental DNA (eDNA) has become a powerful tool for improving the detection of rare and/or invasive species. For the majority of eDNA studies, genetic assays are designed to target mitochondrial genes commonly referred to as “barcode” regions. However, unlike the typical structure of an animal mitochondrial genome, those for the invasive zebra and quagga mussels are greatly expanded with large extended tandem repeat regions. These sections of repeated DNA can appear hundreds of times within the genome compared to a single copy for the mitochondrial barcode genes. This higher number of target copies per mitochondrial genome presents an opportunity to increase eDNA assay sensitivity for these species. Therefore, we designed and evaluated new eDNA assays to target the extended repeat sections for both zebra and quagga mussels. These assays lower the limit of detection of genomic DNA by 100-fold for zebra mussels and 10-fold for quagga mussels. Additionally, these newly developed assays provided longer durations of detection during degradation mesocosm experiments and greater sensitivity for eDNA detection from water samples collected across western Lake Erie compared to standard assays targeting mitochondrial genes. This work illustrates how understanding the complete genomic structure of an organism can improve eDNA analysis.

TT  - Influencia dos níveis de nutrientes, tempo de viagem e disponibilidade de luz nas concentraçöes de clorofila-a fitoplanctônica em uma bacia de rio neotropical
AN  - 2679853602
AB  - Resumo: Objetivo: Um maior conhecimento sobre os fatores que influenciam a biomassa de fitoplancton em rios é importante para a caracterizaçâo da qualidade da água, bem como para prever os efeitos de mudanças ambientais destes ecossistemas. Este estudo quantificou as concentraçöes de clorofila-a na coluna de agua da bacia hidrográfica do rio Miranda - MS, situada na regiao oeste do Brasil, uma das principais formadoras do bioma Pantanal, para identificar as principais influencias na biomassa do fitoplâncton. Métodos: Temperatura, profundidade, velocidade de correnteza, turbidez, transparencia por Disco de Secchi, e concentraçöes de nutrientes, sólidos em suspensâo, e clorofila-a foram medidos a intervalos aproximadamente mensais, durante um ano, em cinco pontos do planalto e tres pontos na planicie. Relaçöes entre clorofila a e concentraçöes de nutrientes, tempo de viagem e disponibilidade de luz foram examinados. Resultados: Os niveis de nutrientes foram geralmente baixos, sendo oligo- a mesotrófico. Altas concentraçöes de sólidos em suspensâo foram encontradas (até aproximadamente 250 mg.L-1), especialmente na época chuvosa nos pontos no planalto. No planalto ocorreram baixas concentraçöes de clorofila-a, enquanto nos pontos da planicie, com exceçâo de um, ocorreram dois picos, no inverno (época seca) e no verâo (época chuvosa), de 4,9 e 2,4 pg.L'1, respectivamente, coincidindo com concentraçöes reduzidas de sólidos em suspensâo. Conclusoes: Os baixos niveis de nutrientes provavelmente estâo relacionados ao uso da terra, principalmente para pecuaria. As altas concentraçöes de sólidos devem estar relacionadas a degradaçâo da vegetaçâo nativa, especialmente da mata ciliar nas últimas décadas. O tempo de viagem de aproximadamente tres a quarto dias nos pontos de planalto, comparado ao tempo de aproximadamente dez dias nos pontos da planicie, podem ter sido um fator determinante na diminuiçâo da abundância de algas no planalto, enquanto a limitaçâo por luz poderia ter sido importante diminuindo o crescimento de algas na planicie.Alternate abstract:Aim: Knowledge of the factors influencing the biomass of phytoplankton in rivers is important with reference to the characterization of water quality and predicting the effects of environmental change on such ecosystems. The present study quantified the concentrations of chlorophyll-a in the water column of the Miranda River Basin, located in western Brazil, contributing to form the Pantanal Wetland, and attempted to identify the primary environmental influences on the phytoplankton biomass. Methods: Temperature, depth, current speed, turbidity, Secchi transparency and concentrations of nutrients, suspended solids and chlorophyll-a were measured at approximate monthly intervals during the course of a year, at five upland and three lowland sites. Relationships between chlorophyll-a and nutrient concentrations, travel times and light availability were examined. Results: Nutrient levels were generally low, being oligo- to mesotrophic. High levels of suspended solids were recorded (up to approximately 250 mg.L-1), especially in the rainy season at the upland sites. The latter showed low chlorophyll-a concentrations, while lowland sites, with the exception of one, showed two peaks, one in winter (dry season) and the other in summer (wet season), of 4.9 and 2.4qg.L-1, respectively, coincident with reduced concentrations of suspended solids. Conclusions: The low nutrient levels recorded may have been due to the main land use being cattle rearing. The high solids concentrations found may have been due to the degradation of native vegetation, especially riparian, that has occurred over the past decades. Travel times of approximately three to four days may have been a factor in retarding algal abundance in the upland sites, as opposed to approximately ten days in the lowland sites, where light limitation may have been a factor reducing algal growth.

T1  - Biocide vs. Eco-Friendly Antifoulants: Role of the Antioxidative Defence and Settlement in <i>Mytilus galloprovincialis</i>
AN  - 2679728006
AB  - Antifoulant paints were developed to prevent and reduce biofouling on surfaces immersed in seawater. The widespread use of these substances over the years has led to a significant increase of their presence in the marine environment. These compounds were identified as environmental and human threats. As a result of an international ban, research in the last decade has focused on developing a new generation of benign antifoulant paints. This review outlines the detrimental effects associated with biocide versus eco-friendly antifoulants, highlighting what are effective antifoulants and why there is a need to monitor them. We examine the effects of biocide and eco-friendly antifoulants on the antioxidative defence mechanism and settlement in a higher sessile organism, specifically the Mediterranean mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis. These antifoulants can indirectly assess the potential of these two parameters in order to outline implementation of sustainable antifoulants.

T1  - Environmental Viability Analysis of Connected European Inland–Marine Waterways and Their Services in View of Climate Change
AN  - 2679655205
AB  - Inland waterways and their connections to marine transport systems constitute a substantial resource for the establishment of green infrastructures, flood prevention, and environmental conservation. However, these developments have numerous inherent environmental hazards such as water and air pollution, a loss of habitats, increased coastal erosion, the transfer of invasive species between connected watercourses and lakes, and the transport of pollutants through watercourses to coastal areas. Climate change may aggravate these environmental problems through changing temperatures, reduced precipitation, enhancing the adverse impact of excess nutrient discharge, and the entry of invasive species. In this study, we analyse the main European inland waterway corridors and their branches to assess the ecological viability of a pan-European inland waterway network. The environmental viability of such network depends on the right assessment of ecosystem services and protection of biodiversity. A model structure for landscape conservation, green infrastructure development, water replenishment, and ecosystem reconstruction is proposed, considering a sustainable combination of multimodal inland waterway and rail transport.

T1  - Assessment of Total Petroleum Hydrocarbon Contamination of the Red Sea with Endemic Fish from Jeddah (Saudi Arabia) as Bioindicator of Aquatic Environmental Pollution
AN  - 2674406710
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine whether endemic coral fish commonly consumed by Jeddah residents could serve as bioindicators of oil contamination. In addition, we planned to investigate the relationship between amino acid changes and hydrocarbon concentrations in fish tissue. The composition of amino acids was analyzed using high-pressure liquid chromatography with precolumn derivatization. An analytical study of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and total petroleum hydrocarbons was conducted by combining gas chromatography with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Multivariate statistical analysis was applied using Statgraphics software to determine the impact of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and total petroleum hydrocarbons on the amino acid profile of three species of fish. In addition, the bioconcentration factor was estimated in the studied species and was used to validate the results obtained from the multivariate analysis. Based on the results of the study, the sum of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with two cycles, and with five to six cycles, is in reverse order in Plectropomus pessuliferus with respect to Epinephelus tauvina and Cephalopholis argus. The factor analysis showed high factor scores for aspartic acid, glutamic acid, tyrosine, chrysene, and total petroleum hydrocarbons, and for lipids and benzo(g,h,i)perylene, which could be explained by bioaccumulation. It was concluded that the high proportions of glutamic acid (8.32–11.10%) and aspartic acid (6.06–8.27%) in the muscles of the studied species are a sign of contamination with petroleum hydrocarbons. The incremental lifetime cancer risk values for the three endemic fish exceeded the limit value (>10−5), indicating a high potential cancer risk for the Saudi population.

T1  - Drivers of zooplankton spatial dynamics in a small neotropical
TT  - Condutores da dinâmica espacial do zooplâncton em um pequeno rio neotropical
AN  - 2659721143
AB  - Objetivo: Nosso objetivo foi descrever a estrutura e os padrões espaciais da comunidade zooplanctônica em um pequeno sistema fluvial brasileiro (sub-bacia do rio Paranaíba) e avaliar o papel de um meandro na dinâmica dessa comunidade. Métodos: Amostras de zooplâncton foram coletadas em pontos localizados em um meandro e no leito do rio Aporé durante os períodos chuvoso e seco. Coletamos essas amostras na superfície e fundo de duas zonas diferentes (litorânea e canal). Para cada período hidrológico, a análise de variância foi conduzida para determinar as diferenças na riqueza de espécies e abundância do zooplâncton entre os diferentes pontos (longitudinal), zonas (lateral) e profundidades (vertical). A análise de cluster foi realizada para avaliar a similaridade na composição de espécies. Além disso, uma análise de correspondência canônica foi usada para selecionar as variáveis ambientais que melhor explicaram a variação nos dados de abundância do zooplâncton. Resultados: Registramos 152 espécies: 70 de rotíferos, 53 de amebas testáceas, 20 de cladóceros e 9 de copépodes. Observamos mudanças na riqueza de espécies e abundância do zooplâncton ao longo do eixo longitudinal do rio tanto no período chuvoso quanto no seco. No entanto, não detectamos nenhuma mudança lateral ou vertical nesses atributos. A análise de cluster também indicou que as maiores diferenças na composição de espécies estavam no eixo longitudinal do rio. A variabilidade longitudinal do zooplâncton foi associada principalmente a influência de um meandro a montante, bem como a mudanças na velocidade de fluxo d'água, turbidez e concentrações de sólidos suspensos à jusante. Conclusões: Nossos resultados demonstraram a importância de uma heterogeneidade de características hidrológicas como fator estruturante da comunidade zooplanctônica no rio Aporé. Assim, destacamos a relevância de ações para proteger e manter as características naturais desses ambientes.Alternate abstract:Aim: Our objective was to describe the structure and spatial patterns of the zooplankton community in a small Brazilian river system (Paranaíba River sub-basin) and evaluate the role of an oxbow lake in the dynamics of this community. Methods: Zooplankton samples were collected from sites located in an oxbow lake and the Aporé River bed during the rainy and dry seasons. We collected these samples from the surface and bottom levels of two different zones (littoral and channel). For each hydrological season, analysis of variance was conducted to determine the differences in species richness and abundance of zooplankton among different sites (longitudinal), zones (lateral), and depths (vertical). Cluster analysis was performed to assess the similarity in species composition. In addition, a canonical correspondence analysis was used to select the environmental variables that best explained the variation in zooplankton abundance data. Results: We recorded 152 species: 70 rotifers, 53 testate amoebae, 20 cladocerans, and 9 copepods. We observed changes in the species richness and abundance of zooplankton along the longitudinal axis of the river in both the rainy and dry seasons. However, we did not detect any lateral or vertical changes in these attributes. Cluster analysis also indicated that the greatest differences in species composition were in the longitudinal axis of the river. The longitudinal variability of zooplankton was mainly associated with the influence of an upstream oxbow lake, as well as the changes in water flow velocity, turbidity, and concentrations of suspended solids downstream. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the importance of a heterogeneity of hydrological characteristics as a structuring factor of the zooplankton community in the Aporé River. Thus, we highlight the relevance of actions to protect and maintain the natural characteristics of these environments.

T1  - Oscillation Flow Dam Operation Method for Algal Bloom Mitigation
AN  - 2653040959
AB  - Green algae play an important role in ecosystems as primary producers, but they can cause algal blooms, which are socio-environmental burdens as responding to them requires water resources from dam reservoirs. This study proposes an alternative for reducing algal blooms through dam operation without using additional water resources. A novel oscillation flow concept was suggested: oscillating discharge of dam for irregular flow. To examine its effect, the Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code—National Institute of Environment Research (EFDC-NIER) model was constructed and calibrated for the Namhan River, South Korea, from downstream of the Chungju Dam to downstream of Gangcheon Weir. The water quality in the study area were simulated and analyzed for August 2019, which is when the largest number of harmful cyanobacteria had been reported in recent years. Our results showed that the oscillation flow produced significant variance of flow velocity, and algal bloom density in the Namhan River was reduced by 20–30% through the operation of the Chungju Dam. However, further study and investigation are required before practical application.

T1  - Linking Micropollutants to Trait Syndromes across Freshwater Diatom, Macroinvertebrate, and Fish Assemblages
AN  - 2653035567
AB  - The ecological quality of freshwater ecosystems is endangered by various micropollutants released into the environment by human activities. The cumulative effects of these micropollutants can affect the fitness of organisms and populations and the functional diversity of stream ecosystems. In this study, we investigated the relationships between the joint toxicity of micropollutants and trait syndromes. A trait syndrome corresponds to a combination of traits that could occur together in communities due to the trait selection driven by exposure to these micropollutants. Our objectives were to (i) identify trait syndromes specific to diatom, macroinvertebrate, and fish assemblages and their responses to exposure, taking into account four micropollutant types (mineral micropollutants, pesticides, PAHs, and other organic micropollutants) and nine modes of action (only for pesticides), (ii) explore how these syndromes vary within and among the three biological compartments, (iii) investigate the trait categories driving the responses of syndromes to micropollutant exposure, and (iv) identify specific taxa, so-called paragons, which are highly representative of these syndromes. To achieve these objectives, we analyzed a dataset including the biological and physico-chemical results of 2007 sampling events from a large-scale monitoring survey routinely performed in French wadeable streams. We have identified five (diatoms), eight (macroinvertebrates), and eight (fishes) trait syndromes, either positively or negatively related to an increasing toxicity gradient of different clusters of micropollutant types or modes of action. Our analyses identified several key trait categories and sets of paragons, exhibiting good potential for highlighting exposure by specific micropollutant types and modes of action. Overall, trait syndromes might represent a novel and integrative bioassessment tool, driven by the diversity of trait-based responses to increasing gradients of micropollutant toxic cocktails.

T1  - Immunohistochemical Detection of Various Proteoglycans in the Extracellular Matrix of Zebra Mussels
AN  - 2652967876
AB  - Mussels have been used as animal models for studying ecotoxicology, biomineralization, and bio-adhesion for many years. Despite a wealth of studies on their shell matrix and byssus proteins, few studies have focused on the extracellular matrix molecules in mussel soft tissues. Extracellular matrix molecules may play important roles in biomineralization, immune reaction, and tissue homeostasis. In the present study, extracellular matrix and mineralization-related molecules in zebra mussel soft tissue were immunolocalized using well-characterized monoclonal antibodies. Our results demonstrate specific immunolocalization for collagen IV, fibronectin, and keratan sulfate in hemocytes; collagen IV in peripheral nerves; and aggrecan, link protein, and collagen XVIII in foot tissue. Laminin, decorin, and osteonectin were also broadly immunolocalized in mussel soft tissues. The distributions of these extracellular matrix molecules in mussel tissues are in line with the cell-mediated shell mineralization hypothesis, providing evidence for the molecules involved in the peripheral nervous system and byssus formation, and explaining the conservation of extracellular matrix molecules during evolution. These results further contribute to establishing zebra mussels as an attractive animal model in biomedical research.

T1  - Consumption of Non-Native Bigheaded Carps by Native Blue Catfish in an Impounded Bay of the Upper Mississippi River
AN  - 2652966424
AB  - Adult bigheaded carps Hypophthalmichthys spp. have never been observed in the diets of native fishes in the Mississippi River Basin. In addition, blue catfish Ictalurus furcatus diet preference and foraging behavior have never been studied in the presence of non-native bigheaded carps in the Mississippi River system. We examined the gut contents of adult blue catfish (567–1020 mm, n = 65), captured from a Mississippi River backwater using trammel nets. All items in diets were separated and enumerated, and all fish-like diet items were genetically identified to confirm species-level ID. Bigheaded carp ages were determined by sectioning hard structures (pectoral spines, post-cleithra, and vertebrae). Adult silver carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix (age 3–5, mean = 3.9 years, SE = 0.2; n = 21) had the highest frequency of occurrence (70%) and constituted the greatest percentage by number (58%) and weight (60%) in/of blue catfish diets. Gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum ranked second by all three measures (34%, 25%, and 26%). Finally, 50% to 100% of probable age-based sizes of silver carp exceeded gape measurements of blue catfish, suggesting scavenging was the dominant means of predation. More intensive sampling efforts are required to determine the system-wide importance of bigheaded carp in blue catfish diets.

T1  - Global climate change and the Baltic Sea ecosystem: direct and indirect effects on species, communities and ecosystem functioning
AN  - 2648824622
AB  - Climate change has multiple effects on Baltic Sea species, communities and ecosystem functioning through changes in physical and biogeochemical environmental characteristics of the sea. Associated indirect and secondary effects on species interactions, trophic dynamics and ecosystem function are expected to be significant. We review studies investigating species-, population- and ecosystem-level effects of abiotic factors that may change due to global climate change, such as temperature, salinity, oxygen, pH, nutrient levels, and the more indirect biogeochemical and food web processes, primarily based on peer-reviewed literature published since 2010.For phytoplankton, clear symptoms of climate change, such as prolongation of the growing season, are evident and can be explained by the warming, but otherwise climate effects vary from species to species and area to area. Several modelling studies project a decrease of phytoplankton bloom in spring and an increase in cyanobacteria blooms in summer. The associated increase in N:P ratio may contribute to maintaining the “vicious circle of eutrophication”. However, uncertainties remain because some field studies claim that cyanobacteria have not increased and some experimental studies show that responses of cyanobacteria to temperature, salinity and pH vary from species to species. An increase of riverine dissolved organic matter (DOM) may also decrease primary production, but the relative importance of this process in different sea areas is not well known. Bacteria growth is favoured by increasing temperature and DOM, but complex effects in the microbial food web are probable. Warming of seawater in spring also speeds up zooplankton growth and shortens the time lag between phytoplankton and zooplankton peaks, which may lead to decreasing of phytoplankton in spring. In summer, a shift towards smaller-sized zooplankton and a decline of marine copepod species has been projected.In deep benthic communities, continued eutrophication promotes high sedimentation and maintains good food conditions for zoobenthos. If nutrient abatement proceeds, improving oxygen conditions will first increase zoobenthos biomass, but the subsequent decrease of sedimenting matter will disrupt the pelagic–benthic coupling and lead to a decreased zoobenthos biomass. In the shallower photic systems, heatwaves may produce eutrophication-like effects, e.g. overgrowth of bladderwrack by epiphytes, due to a trophic cascade. If salinity also declines, marine species such as bladderwrack, eelgrass and blue mussel may decline. Freshwater vascular plants will be favoured but they cannot replace macroalgae on rocky substrates. Consequently invertebrates and fish benefiting from macroalgal belts may also suffer. Climate-induced changes in the environment also favour establishment of non-indigenous species, potentially affecting food web dynamics in the Baltic Sea.As for fish, salinity decline and continuing of hypoxia is projected to keep cod stocks low, whereas the increasing temperature has been projected to favour sprat and certain coastal fish. Regime shifts and cascading effects have been observed in both pelagic and benthic systems as a result of several climatic and environmental effects acting synergistically.Knowledge gaps include uncertainties in projecting the future salinity level, as well as stratification and potential rate of internal loading, under different climate forcings. This weakens our ability to project how pelagic productivity, fish populations and macroalgal communities may change in the future. The 3D ecosystem models, food web models and 2D species distribution models would benefit from integration, but progress is slowed down by scale problems and inability of models to consider the complex interactions between species. Experimental work should be better integrated into empirical and modelling studies of food web dynamics to get a more comprehensive view of the responses of the pelagic and benthic systems to climate change, from bacteria to fish. In addition, to better understand the effects of climate change on the biodiversity of the Baltic Sea, more emphasis should be placed on studies of shallow photic environments.The fate of the Baltic Sea ecosystem will depend on various intertwined environmental factors and on development of the society. Climate change will probably delay the effects of nutrient abatement and tend to keep the ecosystem in its “novel” state. However, several modelling studies conclude that nutrient reductions will be a stronger driver for ecosystem functioning of the Baltic Sea than climate change. Such studies highlight the importance of studying the Baltic Sea as an interlinked socio-ecological system.

T1  - Assessing the Variances of Citizen Stakeholder Justice in Watershed Governance: Is Action More Effective with Reactive or Proactive Administrations
AN  - 2642487945
AB  - Watershed governance has historically been administered by natural resource experts and is often inaccessible to citizen stakeholders. Although many advocate for deliberative democracy as a pathway toward natural resource sustainability, others remain skeptical due to perceived tradeoffs. Environmental deliberative democracy (EDD) serves as a conceptual synthesis of collaborative principles. This research compares the social, economic, and political discourses in two Wisconsin watersheds (Geneva Lake in regulatory compliance and Green Lake, which is deemed state impaired) and posits that EDD community compatibility is enhanced by public trust in expert capacity and accessible watershed education resources. A mixed methodology is used to analyze quantitative data from citizen surveys and qualitative interview responses. Findings affirm that proactive watershed management frameworks are stronger when not prompted by environmental crises. Management programs created reactively with a specific agenda have a comparable structure with citizen involvement but have a limited capacity, scope, and potential for sustained success.

T1  - Climate change in the Baltic Sea region: a summary
AN  - 2638869702
AB  - Based on the Baltic Earth Assessment Reports of this thematic issue in Earth System Dynamics and recent peer-reviewed literature, current knowledge of the effects of global warming on past and future changes in climate of the Baltic Sea region is summarised  and assessed. The study is an update of the Second Assessment of Climate Change (BACC II) published in 2015 and focuses on the atmosphere, land, cryosphere, ocean, sediments, and the terrestrial and marine biosphere. Based on the summaries of the recent knowledge gained in palaeo-, historical, and future regional climate research, we find that the main conclusions from earlier assessments still remain valid. However, new long-term, homogenous observational records, for example, for Scandinavian glacier inventories, sea-level-driven saltwater inflows, so-called Major Baltic Inflows, and phytoplankton species distribution, and new scenario simulations with improved models, for example, for glaciers, lake ice, and marine food web, have become available. In many cases, uncertainties can now be better estimated than before because more models were included in the ensembles, especially for the Baltic Sea. With the help of coupled models, feedbacks between several components of the Earth system have been studied, and multiple driver studies were performed, e.g. projections of the food web that include fisheries, eutrophication, and climate change. New datasets and projections have led to a revised understanding of changes in some variables such as salinity. Furthermore, it has become evident that natural variability, in particular for the ocean on multidecadal timescales, is greater than previously estimated, challenging our ability to detect observed and projected changes in climate. In this context, the first palaeoclimate simulations regionalised for the Baltic Sea region are instructive. Hence, estimated uncertainties for the projections of many variables increased. In addition to the well-known influence of the North Atlantic Oscillation, it was found that also other low-frequency modes of internal variability, such as the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability, have profound effects on the climate of the Baltic Sea region. Challenges were also identified, such as the systematic discrepancy between future cloudiness trends in global and regional models and the difficulty of confidently attributing large observed changes in marine ecosystems to climate change. Finally, we compare our results with other coastal sea assessments, such as the North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment (NOSCCA), and find that the effects of climate change on the Baltic Sea differ from those on the North Sea, since Baltic Sea oceanography and ecosystems are very different from other coastal seas such as the North Sea. While the North Sea dynamics are dominated by tides, the Baltic Sea is characterised by brackish water, a perennial vertical stratification in the southern subbasins, and a seasonal sea ice cover in the northern subbasins.

AB  - Изучение демографических особенностей популяций чужеродных видов на стадии экспансии позволяет оценить их инвазивный потенциал. Полевые исследования чужеродных наземных гастроподXeropicta derbentina (Gastropoda, Stylommatophora, Hygromiidae), Brephulopsis cylindrica (Gastropoda, Stylommatophora, Enidae) и Harmozica ravergiensis (Gastropoda, Stylommatophora, Hygromiidae) были проведены на территории юга Среднерусской возвышенности в Белгороде (Россия). Все виды нативны для Причерноморья и Кавказа, а на юге Среднерусской возвышенности их первые находки были отмечены в течение последних десяти лет. Анализ динамики плотности популяций, их демографической структуры и пространственной организации был выполнен на основании данных за три года наблюдений (2017, 2019, 2020). За этот период отмечены изменения плотности популяции у всех исследуемых видов. Наибольшие изменения наблюдались у X. derbentina, плотность популяции которой значимо снизилась, а пространственная организация сменилась с агрегированной на случайную. Кроме того, популяция X derbentina продемонстрировала смену возрастной структуры в начале сезона активности в 2020 году. Экспансия двух других вселенцев оказалась более успешной. При этом H. ravergiensis распространена по всей территории города и имеет достаточно стабильные значения плотности популяции и случайный тип пространственного распределения на большинстве исследуемых участков. B. cylindrica имеет наиболее высокую плотность популяции: в 2020 году средняя плотность достигла 406 особей на метр квадратный, а максимальное значение достигло 1215 особи на метр квадратный за этот же год. При этом вид сохраняет агрегированную пространственную структуру, что объясняется не только высокой плотностью, но и адаптацией к аридным условиям естественного ареала.Alternate abstract:Studying of the demographic characteristics of populations of alien species at the stage of expansion makes it possible to assess their invasive potential. Field studies of alien terrestrial gastropods Xeropicta derbentina (Gastropoda, Stylommatophora, Hygromiidae), Brephulopsis cylindrica (Gastropoda, Stylommatophora, Enidae) and Harmozica ravergiensis (Gastropoda, Stylommatophora, Hygromiidae) have been carried out in Belgorod city, the southern part of the Central Russian Upland (Russia). All studied species are native to the Black Sea region and the Caucasus; in the southern part of the Central Russian Upland, they have been registered over the past ten years. The population density, demographic structure, and spatial structure have been analyzed for three years of observations (2017, 2019, 2020). During this period, the changes in the population density have been noted for all studied species. The most pronounced changes have been observed in X. derbentina, whose population density has significantly decreased, and the spatial structure has changed from clustered type to random distribution. In addition, the age structure of X. derbentina population had a pronounced change at the beginning of the snail activity season of 2020. The expansion of the other two invaders, B. cylindrica and H. ravergiensis, is proved as more successful. At the same time, H. ravergiensis is distributed throughout the city. This species has stable population density and random type of spatial population structure on most sites. B. cylindrica has the highest population density: in 2020, it has reached 406 ind./m2 on average, with the maximum of 1215 ind./m2. Meantime, the species keeps the clustered spatial structure, which is explained by both high population density and adaptation to the arid conditions of its natural range.

T1  - Land Use Change to Reduce Freshwater Nitrogen and Phosphorus will Be Effective Even with Projected Climate Change
AN  - 2637794939
AB  - Recent studies have demonstrated that projected climate change will likely enhance nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) loss from farms and farmland, with the potential to worsen freshwater eutrophication. Here, we investigate the relative importance of the climate and land use drivers of nutrient loss in nine study catchments in Europe and a neighboring country (Turkey), ranging in area from 50 to 12,000 km2. The aim was to quantify whether planned large-scale, land use change aimed at N and P loss reduction would be effective given projected climate change. To this end, catchment-scale biophysical models were applied within a common framework to quantify the integrated effects of projected changes in climate, land use (including wastewater inputs), N deposition, and water use on river and lake water quantity and quality for the mid-21st century. The proposed land use changes were derived from catchment stakeholder workshops, and the assessment quantified changes in mean annual N and P concentrations and loads. At most of the sites, the projected effects of climate change alone on nutrient concentrations and loads were small, whilst land use changes had a larger effect and were of sufficient magnitude that, overall, a move to more environmentally focused farming achieved a reduction in N and P concentrations and loads despite projected climate change. However, at Beyşehir lake in Turkey, increased temperatures and lower precipitation reduced water flows considerably, making climate change, rather than more intensive nutrient usage, the greatest threat to the freshwater ecosystem. Individual site responses did however vary and were dependent on the balance of diffuse and point source inputs. Simulated lake chlorophyll-a changes were not generally proportional to changes in nutrient loading. Further work is required to accurately simulate the flow and water quality extremes and determine how reductions in freshwater N and P translate into an aquatic ecosystem response.

T1  - Zooplankton as Mercury Repository in Lake Maggiore (Northern Italy): Biomass Composition and Stable Isotope Analysis
AN  - 2637789487
AB  - Total mercury (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations were analyzed in zooplankton (≥450 and ≥850 µm size fractions) collected seasonally over 6 years in Lake Maggiore (Northern Italy), characterized by a legacy mercury contamination. Analysis of δ 15N and δ13C stable isotopes was carried out to trace how taxa with different trophic levels and carbon sources contributed to mercury concentrations and trends. THg ranged between 44–213 µg kg−1 d.w. and MeHg 15–93 µg kg−1 d.w., representing 24–61% of THg. Values showed strong seasonal variations, with peaks in winter, due to the high biomass of predator taxa (Bythotrephes longimanus, Leptodora kindtii) and of Daphnia longispina-galeata gr. A positive correlation between THg and MeHg and δ15N signature was observed. D. longispina-galeata gr. prevailed in both size fractions, substantially contributing to THg and MeHg concentrations. Δ13C signature was strictly bound to lake thermal circulation dynamics. Mercury stock in the zooplankton compartment ranged between 19–140 ng THg m−2 and 6–44 ng MeHg m−2 for the ≥450 µm size fraction and between 2–66 ng THg m−2 and 1–7 ng MeHg m−2 for the ≥850 µm fraction, with the highest values in spring when zooplanktivorous fish actively prey in the pelagic zone. The results highlighted the crucial role of zooplankton as a repository of mercury, easily available to higher trophic levels.

T1  - Evaluating Multiple Stressor Effects on Benthic–Pelagic Freshwater Communities in Systems of Different Complexities: Challenges in Upscaling
AN  - 2633202468
AB  - Upscaling of ecological effects from indoor microcosms to outdoor mesocosms bridging the gap between controlled laboratory conditions and highly complex natural environments poses several challenges: typical standard water types used in laboratory experiments are not feasible in large outdoor experiments. Additionally, moving from the micro- to meso-scale, biodiversity is enhanced. We performed an indoor microcosm experiment to determine the effects of agricultural run-off (ARO) on a defined benthic–pelagic community comprising primary producers and primary consumers, exposed to ambient summer temperature and +3.5 °C. Treatments were replicated in two water types (standard Volvic and Munich well water). We then scaled up to outdoor mesocosms using an ARO concentration gradient and +3 °C warming above ambient temperature, using Munich well water. We included the same benthic macroorganisms but more complex periphyton and plankton communities. All the functional groups were affected by stressors in the microcosms, and a shift from macrophyte to phytoplankton dominance was observed. While effects were present, they were less pronounced in the mesocosms, where a higher biodiversity may have modified the responses of the system to the stressors. The stressor effects observed in controlled experiments may thus be masked in more complex outdoor experiments, but should not be interpreted as “no effects”.

T1  - Sudden Changes in Water Hardness Do Not Impact Short-Term Rainbow Trout Survival
AN  - 2632936805
AB  - Fish transferred from hard water to soft water, as can occur during the stocking of hatchery-reared fish into natural environments, experience many physiological stressors that can cause mortality. This study consisted of four trials examining the effects of direct transfer from hard (345 mg/L CaCO3) to soft water on mortality and glucose stress response of two different sizes and strains of rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss. The first trial subjected 90 g Shasta strain rainbow trout to a direct transfer to soft water (70 or 160 mg/L as CaCO3). The second trial used the same strain and size trout, with transfer to lower hardness values of either 0 or 35 mg/L. The third and fourth trials used 3 to 5 g Arlee strain rainbow trout. The third trial transferred the fish from 345 mg/L hardness water to water at a hardness of either 0 or 35 mg/L. The fourth trial added a secondary temperature stressor of 20 °C (versus the experimental standard of 11 °C) in combination with a hardness level of 0 mg/L. In every trial, survival was not significantly different among all treatments. Sudden and extreme changes in water hardness, even in combination with increased water temperature, did not cause trout mortality. There was also no significant difference in blood glucose over time among any of the treatments in the first three trials. In the fourth trial, glucose values did significantly vary among the treatments at 48 and 168 h after the start of the trial. However, all glucose values were relatively close to the basal level. These results indicate that changes in water hardness likely do not impact the survival of rainbow trout, negating the need for tempering or acclimation.

T1  - Towards Risk Assessments of Microplastics in Bivalve Mollusks Globally
AN  - 2632829770
AB  - The ubiquitous presence of microplastics in bivalve mollusks and related risks have raised particular concerns. In this study, the available data on the abundance and polymer type of microplastics in bivalves from twenty-two countries were extracted to comprehensively understand the risks of microplastics in bivalves. Following the data from 52 peer-reviewed papers, the abundance, chemical composition, and human exposure risks of microplastics of bivalves among countries were initially assessed. Abundance risk results indicated that bivalves from 22 countries presented a low pollution load index, showing a lower risk level (level I). The polymer risk index (H) of bivalves from Portugal (Hcountry = 1335, level IV) and India (Hcountry = 1187, level IV) were higher than the other countries due to the occurrence of hazardous microplastics, such as polyvinyl chloride. For the human exposure risks, the global mean value of microplastic exposure to humans via mollusk consumption is estimated to be 751 microplastics/capita/year, with the maximum intake by the Chinese. This study suggests that abundance risk may be a fundamental indicator for assessing the potential hazard to humans until the chemical composition risks are confirmed. This study is the first attempt to assess the potential risks of microplastics in bivalves using three evaluation models based on microplastic abundances and polymer types, which will contribute to establishing future human health risk assessment frameworks. These findings will also assist efforts in policy-making to minimize microplastic risks in seafood.

T1  - Fish Diversity Monitored by Environmental DNA in the Yangtze River Mainstream
AN  - 2632828238
AB  - Surveys and assessments based on environmental DNA are not only efficient and time-saving, but also cause less harm to monitoring targets. Environmental DNA has become a common tool for the assessment and monitoring of aquatic organisms. In this study, we investigated fish resources in the Yangtze River mainstream using environmental DNA, and the variations in fish during two seasons (spring and autumn) were compared. The results showed that 13 species were identified in spring, and nine species of fish were identified in autumn. The fish with higher eDNA detection were Sinibotia superciliaris, Tachysurus fulvidraco, Cyprinus carpio, Ctenopharyngodon Idella, Monopterus albus, Acanthogobius hasta, Saurogobio dabryi, Oncorhynchus mykiss, Mugil cephalus, Odontamblyopus rubicundus. Seasonal variation between spring and autumn was not significant, and the environmental factors had different effects on fish assemblages during the two seasons. Our study used the eDNA technique to monitor the composition of fish in the spring and autumn in the Yangtze River mainstream, providing a new technology for the long-term management and protection of fishery resources in the region. Of course, problems such as pollution and insufficient databases are the current shortcomings of environmental DNA, which will be the focus of our future research and study.

T1  - An automatic lake-model application using near-real-time data forcing: development of an operational forecast workflow (COASTLINES) for Lake Erie
AN  - 2629051251
AB  - For enhanced public safety and water resource management, a three-dimensional operational lake hydrodynamic forecasting system, COASTLINES (Canadian cOASTal and Lake forecastINg modEl System), was developed. The modeling system is built upon the three-dimensional Aquatic Ecosystem Model (AEM3D) model, with predictive simulation capabilities developed and tested for a large lake (i.e., Lake Erie). The open-access workflow derives model forcing, code execution, post-processing, and web-based visualization of the model outputs, including water level elevations and temperatures, in near-real time. COASTLINES also generates 240 h predictions using atmospheric forcing from 15 and 25 km horizontal-resolution operational meteorological products from the Environment Canada Global Deterministic Forecast System (GDPS). Simulated water levels were validated against observations from six gauge stations, with model error increasing with forecast horizon. Satellite images and lake buoys were used to validate forecast lake surface temperature and the water column thermal stratification. The forecast lake surface temperature is as accurate as hindcasts, with a root-mean-square deviation <2 ∘C. COASTLINES predicted storm surges and up-/downwelling events that are important for coastal flooding and drinking water/fishery management, respectively. Model forecasts are available in real time at https://coastlines.engineering.queensu.ca/ (last access: January 2022​​​​​​​). This study provides an example of the successful development of an operational forecasting workflow, entirely driven by open-access data, that may be easily adapted to simulate aquatic systems or to drive other computational models, as required for management and public safety.

T1  - Advances in the Fate of Rare Earth Elements, REE, in Transitional Environments: Coasts and Estuaries
AN  - 2627848686
AB  - The production of rare earth elements, REE, has significantly increased over the past years, in parallel with the latest advances in nanotechnologies and representing a new group of emerging contaminants. They find application in construction, transport, agriculture, electronics, catalysis, and biomedicine. Their extraordinary intrinsic characteristics are fundamental for overcoming current technological challenges. The accumulation of REE is consistent in near-shore waters being affected by runoff, wastewater discharge, and proximity to built-up areas. Bioavailability in water, sediments, and accumulation in marine biota as well their endocrine disruptor effect is mostly unknown. There is a significant gap of knowledge on the ecotoxicological behaviour of REE in marine areas. The existing investigations have been performed inside well-mixed estuarine systems, due to complex hydrodynamics and multiple sediment transport situations. This hampers the definition of regulatory thresholds for REE concentrations and emissions. The review summarizes the existing information on REE geochemistry and physicochemical conditions influencing dissolution, surface complexation reactions, and distribution at the continent–ocean interface, as well as their speciation, bioavailability, and detrimental effects on living organisms. Strategies for reducing REE usage and inputs are also discussed.

T1  - Spatio-temporal variation in stable isotope and elemental composition of key-species reflect environmental changes in the Baltic Sea
AN  - 2619578083
AB  - Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios are increasingly used to study long-term change in food web structure and nutrient cycling. We retrospectively analyse elemental composition (C, N and P) and stable isotopes (δ13C, δ15N) in archived monitoring samples of two important taxa from the bottom of the food web; the filamentous ephemeral macroalgae Cladophora spp. and the blue mussel Mytilus edulis trossulus from three contrasting regions in the Baltic Sea (coastal Bothnian Sea and Baltic Proper, open sea central Baltic). The aim is to statistically link the observed spatial and interannual (8–24 years’ time-series) variability in elemental and isotope baselines with their biomass trends and to the oceanographic monitoring data reflecting the ongoing environmental changes (i.e., eutrophication and climate) in this system. We find clear differences in isotope baselines between the two major Baltic Sea basins. However, the temporal variation in Mytilus δ13C was similar among regions and, at the open sea station, mussels and algae δ13C also correlated over time, likely reflecting a global (Suess) effect, whereas δ15N of both taxa varied with local and regional dissolved nitrogen concentrations in water. δ15N in source amino acids allowed detection of diazotrophic N in Mytilus, which was masked in bulk δ15N. Finally, Cladophora N:P reflected regional nutrient levels in the water while P%, which differed for both taxa, was linked to food quality for Mytilus. This study highlights the potential of a multi-taxa and multi-stable isotope approach to understand nutrient dynamics and monitor long-term environmental changes.

T1  - Partitioning benthic nitrogen cycle processes among three common macrofauna holobionts
AN  - 2619577907
AB  - The effects of single macrofauna taxa on benthic nitrogen (N) cycling have been extensively studied, whereas how macrofaunal communities affect N-related processes remains poorly explored. In this study, we characterized benthic N-cycling in bioturbated sediments of the oligotrophic Öre Estuary (northern Baltic Sea). Solute fluxes and N transformations (N2 fixation, denitrification and dissimilative nitrate reduction to ammonium [DNRA]) were measured in sediments and macrofauna-associated microbes (holobionts) to partition the role of three dominant taxa (the filter feeder Limecola balthica, the deep deposit feeder Marenzelleria spp., and the surface deposit feeder Monoporeia affinis) in shaping N-cycling. In the studied area, benthic macrofauna comprised a low diversity community with dominance of the three taxa, which are widespread and dominant in the Baltic. The biomass of these taxa in macrofaunal community explained up to 30% of variation in measured biogeochemical processes, confirming their important role in ecosystem functioning. The results also show that these taxa significantly contributed to the benthic metabolism and N-cycling (direct effect) as well as to sediments bioturbation with positive feedback to dissimilative nitrate reduction (indirect effect). Taken together, these functions promoted a reuse of nutrients at the benthic level, limiting net losses (e.g. denitrification) and effluxes to bottom water. Finally, the detection of multiple N transformations in macrofauna holobionts suggested a community-associated versatile microbiome, however, its role was of minor importance as compared to the activity of sediment-associated microbial communities. The present study highlights hidden and interactive effects among microbes and macrofauna, which should be considered analysing benthic functioning.

T1  - Acute exposure of embryo, larvae and adults of <i>Danio rerio</i> to fipronil commercial formulation reveals effects on development and motor control
AN  - 2618748165
AB  - The insecticide fipronil, one of the main pesticides used in Brazil, is often detected in natural aquatic environments, and causes neuronal hyperexcitation by inhibiting GABAergic neurotransmission, leading to putative alterations in behaviour and development. This work sought to analyse the toxicity of formulated Regent® 800WG (80% fipronil) on development (fish embryo toxicity test, FET), morphology, and swimming behaviour of larvae and adults of zebrafish (Danio rerio). FET was performed following OECD236 guidelines at concentrations ranging from 0.002 to 1600 μg.L−1 of formulated Regent® 800WG. Adults were exposed to 0.2, 2 and 20 μg.L−1 of the product for 24 and 96 h, and were submitted to the light-dark, novel tank and swimming endurance tests No lethal parameters were observed in larvae, but in concentrations above 400 µg.L−1, there was shortening of the body axis and decreased swimming behavior. In adults, exposure to the pesticide did not lead to changes in free swimming parameters. However, a marked decrease of swimming endurance was observed at all experimental treatments, although probably not in consequence of energetic depletion, since baseline blood glucose levels and condition factor were similar at all conditions. Furthermore, zebrafish adults did not show their natural preference for the dark environment. The pesticide likely has anxiolytic effects on zebrafish, as well as a compromising effect on locomotor control, illustrating that behavioural changes, which could affect activities on the natural environment, such as escape and predation, may occur even in environmentally relevant concentrations of this pollutant.

T1  - Current aspects of DNA damage and repair in ecotoxicology: a mini-review
AN  - 2618747997
AB  - The preservation of genomic stability against environmental stressors is a major adaptive feature that is well-conserved among both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The complex and fine-tuned mechanisms that evolved to repair DNA following exposure to radiation and chemical insult are also the first line of defence against genotoxicants. Consequently, impairing the DNA damage response leads to accumulation of genomic lesions that may ultimately lead to cell death, mutagenesis and even teratogenesis and neoplasia. Understanding how pollutants affect DNA repair machinery is thus paramount to interpret the often unclear or contradictory findings from genotoxicity assessment. The main purpose of the present mini-review is to contribute to the slowly-growing awareness among ecotoxicologists that DNA damage is not limited to direct interactions of noxious compounds with the DNA molecule. Despite the limited number of studies addressing this issue in the field, special modifications of methods for genotoxicity assessment, combined with state-of-the-art molecular tools, are beginning to show promising results in the unravelling of DNA repair proteins, genes and networks in non-conventional model organisms. I will review the essentials of the most important DNA repair pathways and discuss methods and approaches that can assist steering ecotoxicologists towards a better understanding of genotoxic hazard and risk.

T1  - Factors associated with the population structure of an invasive mollusk in a neotropical floodplain
AN  - 2611008817
AB  - Limnoperna fortunei is an invasive mussel species that is continuously expanding through South American. It has five larval stages, which usually differ in tolerance to environmental factors. How different abiotic filters affect L. fortunei larval stages has not been studied in depth. We employed a detailed database describing five floodplain environments to investigate the distribution of L. fortunei larval stages within and among these environments and determine which local abiotic filters affect the density of each larval stage. We found that the two youngest larval stages accounted for up to 83% of the larval density in four of the five environments studied, confirming an expanding population pyramid of L. fortunei in these environments. We also found positive and negative relationships among abiotic filters, and these relationships affected, directly and indirectly, the density of the youngest larval stages. Turbidity, water level, and suspended inorganic matter directly decreased the density of the two youngest larval stages. Conversely, temperature and pH directly increased the density of D-shaped and umbonated stages, respectively. Additionally, water level indirectly increased the density of the youngest larval stages mediated by declines in turbidity and suspended inorganic matter. Our findings suggest a likely expansion of L. fortunei in the Upper Paraná Floodplain. However, local abiotic filters, such as turbidity, water level, and suspended inorganic matter, decrease the density of the youngest larval stages. This finding illustrates that the establishment of L. fortunei can be prevented mainly if the youngest larval stages are controlled.

T1  - Evaluating Connections Between Nitrogen Cycling and the Macrofauna in Native Oyster Beds in a New England Estuary
AN  - 2610663217
AB  - Recent efforts to quantify biogeochemical and ecological processes in oyster habitats have focused on provision of habitat and regulation of the nitrogen cycle. However, it is unclear how these two processes may interact. In this study, seasonal patterns of habitat use and nitrogen removal from natural oyster beds were quantified for comparison with nearby bare sediment in Green Hill Pond, a temperate coastal lagoon in RI, USA. Relationships were tested between benthic macrofaunal abundance and nitrogen removal via denitrification and burial in sediments. Nitrogen removal by oyster bio-assimilation was quantified and compared with nearby oyster aquaculture. Despite limited differences in habitat use by macrofauna, there were fewer non-oyster benthic organisms (e.g., filter-feeders, detritivores) where oysters were present, possibly due to competition for resources. Additionally, low rugosity of the native oyster beds provided little refuge value for prey. There was a shift from net N removal via denitrification in bare sediments to nitrogen fixation beneath oysters, though this change was not statistically significant (t(96) = 1.201; p = 0.233). Sediments contained low concentrations of N; however sediments beneath oysters contained almost twice as much N (0.07%) as bare sediments (0.04%; p < 0.001). There was no difference in tissue N content between wild oysters and those raised in aquaculture nearby, though caged oysters had more tissue per shell mass and length, and therefore removed more N on a shell length basis. These oyster beds lacked the complex structure of three-dimensional oyster reefs which may have diminished their ability to provide habitat for refugia, foraging sites for macrofauna, and conditions known to stimulate denitrification.

T1  - Indonesian freshwater bivalves: a meta-analysis of endemicity, ecoregion distributions, and conservation status
AN  - 2640801172
AB  - Biological information on Indonesian freshwater bivalves is scattered across publications. Thus, to assemble comprehensive data on their diversity, origin, ecoregion distributions, and conservation status, we conducted a meta-analysis of data from 521 scientific references published between 1838 and early 2021. A total of 57 valid species of 119 freshwater bivalves were documented in the reference sources, reflecting 4.8% of the world's freshwater bivalve species, with 29 (50.9%) being endemic species. Lake Toba, Singkarak, Poso, Malili system river, Sentani, river of Indragiri, Kapuas, Digul and Merauke are the endemicity hotspots of freshwater bivalve in Indonesia. The geographic distribution of species diversity is discussed both in terms of bivalve characteristics and ancient rivers analysis, so it is made that Indonesian's freshwater bivalves were distributed across three ecoregions: 1) Sundaland, comprising the main islands of Sumatra, Java, and Kalimantan (part of Borneo), dominated by the Unionidae; 2) Wallacea, which comprises Sulawesi only, dominated by the Cyrenidae; and 3) the Sahul region, which comprises only Papua and is a hotspot of the Hyriidae. Unfortunately, 43 (75.4%) of the species recorded were not listed in the IUCN directory, and only 12 (21.1%) were recognized by the Indonesian government as protected species. Research on freshwater bivalve species diversity and conservation actions are urgently warranted; neglect of this ecologically and economically important group could cause species declines, more species being categorized as historical species, and, at worst, the unexpected extinction of species. In addition, adequate funding, solid research teams, research continuity, and inter-institutional solid collaboration are needed to strengthen the conservation of freshwater bivalve diversity in Indonesia.

T1  - Concentration of microplastics in bivalves of the environment: a systematic review
AN  - 2603343262
AB  - The aim of this review was to identify the current knowledge regarding the concentration of microplastics in bivalves in the marine, estuarine, and freshwater environments. For this purpose, researches were conducted from September 2020 to February 2021 in the Scopus, Web of Science, and Google scholar databases, following a meticulous selection of articles. To comprehensively understand the selected articles, an extensive review was carried out in order to identify the methodologies employed, sampling sites, species evaluated, characteristics of the microplastics (concentrations, shapes, sizes, and polymers) and their relationship with the concentration of this particles in the environment. A total of 93 articles were selected, with an exponential growth in the number of articles from April 2014 to February 2021. Worldwide, 80 articles were realized in the Northern Hemisphere and thirteen in the Southern Hemisphere. The samplings of organisms were carried out in 36 countries, besides one in Antarctica. The concentration of microplastics were studied in 70 species, with mussels Mytilus spp. and the oysters Crassostrea spp. being the main genus studied. Due to the different methodologies used to digest the tissues of organisms and identify microplastics and species, it is difficult to make comparisons between the results of different studies. In addition, data on the concentrations of microplastics in the environment, as well as their composition and characteristics, are needed, enabling the verification of relationships with the concentrations identified in organisms, which does not occur in most studies. Thus, we suggest an increase in the number of studies to be realized in the southern hemisphere, future studies use the same methodology of digestion, the polymer identification of microplastics and samplings of the surrounding environment, enabling a greater comparison between studies.

T1  - <i>Proteocephalus macrophallus</i> (Cestoda: Proteocephalidae) Infecting <i>Cichla kelberi</i> (Cichliformes: Cichlidae) as a Bioindicator for Trace Metal Accumulation in a Neotropical River from Southeastern Brazil
AN  - 2601736371
AB  - Here, we evaluate the potential for trace metal accumulation of nine elements (Al, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, As, Cd, and Pb) in the cestodes Proteocephalus macrophallus parasitizing the tucunaré, Cichla kelberi, in the Jacaré-Guaçú River, southeastern Brazil. For metal quantification in the tissues of hosts and parasites, an inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) was used. All recovered trace metals were in higher amounts in cestodes than in the tissues (muscle, intestine, and liver) of their hosts. The best accumulated element was lead, with concentrations up to 10,000 times higher in parasites than in the liver of the fish hosts. Other well-accumulated elements were cadmium, with concentrations up to 238 times higher in parasites, and aluminum and nickel, with concentrations ranging from 140 to 128 times higher in parasites. In addition, non-infected fish had higher concentrations of cadmium and lead in their tissues than infected fish. In infected fish, the size of the cestodes’ infrapopulations influenced in the concentrations of arsenic, cadmium, and lead in the hosts tissues. In general, specimens of P. macrophallus had a good capacity for metal accumulation for all the analyzed elements, with emphasis on Al, Ni, Cd, and Pb, and therefore could be a useful tool in trace metal bioaccumulation indication.

T1  - Characterization of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the Great Lakes Basin using dreissenid mussels
AN  - 2599277453
AB  - The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS) Mussel Watch Program (MWP), conducts basin-wide monitoring and place-based assessments using dreissenid mussels as bioindicators of chemical contamination in the Laurentian Great Lakes. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) body burden results for the period 2009–2018 were combined into one dataset from multiple MWP studies allowing for a robust characterization of PAH contamination. Patterns in PAH data were identified using descriptive statistics and machine learning techniques. Relationships between total PAH concentration in dreissenid mussel tissue, impervious surface percentages, and PAH relative concentration were identified and used to build a predictive model for the Great Lakes Basin. Significant positive correlation was identified by the Spearman’s rank correlation test between total PAH concentration and percent impervious surface. The findings support the paradigm that PAHs are primarily derived from land-based sources. Offshore and riverine locations had the lowest and highest median total PAH concentrations, respectively. PAH assemblages and ratios indicated that pyrogenic sources were more predominant than petrogenic sources and that PAHs at offshore sites exhibited relatively more weathering compared to inshore sites.

T1  - The time-dependent variations of zebrafish intestine and gill after polyethylene microplastics exposure
AN  - 2599272302
AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are common environmental contaminants that present a growing health concern due to their increasing presence in aquatic and human systems. However, the mechanisms behind MP effects on organisms are unclear. In this study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) were used as an in vivo model to investigate the potential risks and molecular mechanisms of the toxic effects of polyethylene MPs (45–53 μm). In the zebrafish intestine, 6, 5, and 186 genes showed differential expression after MP treatment for 1, 5, and 10 days, respectively. In the gills, 318, 92, and 484 genes showed differential expression after MP treatment for 1, 5, and 10 days, respectively. In both the intestine and the gills, Gene Ontology (GO) annotation showed that the main enriched terms were biological regulation, cellular process, metabolic process, cellular anatomical entity, and binding. KEGG enrichment analysis on DEGs revealed that the dominant pathways were carbohydrate metabolism and lipid metabolism, which were strongly influenced by MPs in the intestine. The dominant pathways in the gills were immune and lipid metabolism. The respiratory rate of gills, the activity of SOD and GSH in the intestine significantly increased after exposure to MPs compared with the control (p < 0.05), while the activity of SOD did not change in the gills. GSH activity was only significantly increased after MP exposure for 5 days. Also, the MDA content was not changed in the intestine but was significantly decreased in the gills after MP exposure. The activity of AChE significantly decreased only after MPs exposure for 5 days. Overall, these results indicated that MPs pollution significantly induced oxidative stress and neurotoxicity, increased respiratory rate, disturbed energy metabolism and stimulated immune function in fish, displaying an environmental risk of MPs to aquatic ecosystems.

T1  - Ecological interactions between invasive and native fouling species in the reservoir of a hydroelectric plant
AN  - 2588177804
AB  - In this study, we investigate the main ecological interactions between fouling aquatic organisms (both invasive and native) present in the reservoir of the Governador José Richa hydroelectric plant, located in southern Brazil, and to identify the most suitable period for the interruption of machinery operation for cleaning and maintenance of the hydraulic systems of this plant. A total of 32 experimental plates were fixed to a metallic structure positioned close to the plant's water intake. Three species of invasive fouling were identified in our samples (Limnoperna fortunei [Mollusca], Cordylophora sp., and Hydra sp. [Cnidaria]) and six native taxa belonging to the phyla Protozoa, Ciliophora, Amoebozoa, and Arthropoda. Spring and summer were the seasons with the highest fouling rates, as well as densities of fouling organisms. The highest levels of diversity were recorded during the colder seasons. Several interactions between the organisms were identified, such as mutualism, commensalism, competition, epibiosis, cannibalism, and predation. The data obtained suggest that, from the biological point of view, the most suitable period for machine shutdown destined for the removal of biological fouling in the hydraulic systems of the studied plant is between the end of spring and the beginning of summer.

T1  - Nursery habitat characteristics of an invasive, omnivorous fish
AN  - 2588177176
AB  - Understanding habitat use and reproductive biology of invasive species is essential to predicting invasions, designing early detection programs, and developing management plans. The rudd (Scardinius erythrophthalmus; Linnaeus, 1758) is an omnivorous fish native to Europe and western Asia that has been translocated to several countries in western Europe, New Zealand, North America, and Africa. However, little is known about early life history of rudd, particularly in invaded ecosystems, limiting our ability to predict invasions and create early detection and control programs. The upper Niagara River has the most abundant population of rudd in North America and has been the focus of several ecological investigations. Our study identified critical nursery habitats by determining which nearshore habitat factors were most strongly associated with presence of age-0 rudd. We found that emergent vegetation was the most important habitat characteristic associated with the presence of age-0 rudd. When emergent vegetation was not present, rudd were more likely to be present at sites with abundant submerged aquatic vegetation. Additionally, the odds of rudd presence decreased as distance to the nearest wetland increased. These findings can be used to create habitat-driven predictive models of rudd invasion and guide early detection programs for rudd outside their native range.

T1  - Control of invasive apple snails and their use as pollutant ecotoxic indicators: a review
AN  - 2586187255
AB  - Apple snails are one of the most survived fresh water invasive species that causes massive economic loss to vegetations, especially to the rice fields. They survive against many environmental stressors and are considered as a major pest in water-lodged cultivated area due to their intrusiveness, adaptation mechanisms and survivability. Therefore, there is a need for strategies to control their population. Snails can also be used as pollution bioindicators. Here we review apple snails for their ecotoxic management without compromising environment and co-inhabitants, and their use as semi-sessile invasive ecotoxic marker species. Snails have been found to accumulate 0.19–0.21% biphenyl ethers, 1.65% copper sulphate with 26.7% morality, 1.53–29.7% ivermectin, 43% polybrominated biphenyl ethers, 59% triphenylphosphine oxide, 8–100% of various heavy metals and nanoparticles. Feed intake of apple snails can be enhanced up to 22% with copper supplements, while 17 and 100% mortality can be achieved with niclosamide monohydrate (0.13 mg/L) and tea seed derivatives (0.015 g/L) exposure, respectively. Snails respond to stress factors with up to 29.6% higher lipid peroxides and 1.06% protein carbonyls, along with up to 80, 240 and 127% higher activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase enzymes, respectively, after cypermethrin exposure. Oppositely, mercury (2–8 mg/L) and aldicarb can reduce their oxygen consumption and acetylcholinesterase activity of up to 88.1 and 96.08%, respectively.

T1  - Can zooplankton species be used as indicators of trophic status and ecological potential of reservoirs?
AN  - 2584875481
AB  - The European Water Framework Directive implements the policies to achieve a good ecological status of all European waterbodies. To determine the ecological potential in freshwater environments, abiotic (morphology, physical and chemical variables) and biotics (algae, fishes, etc.) metrics are used. Despite their importance in trophic web, zooplankton was not included as one of the Biological Quality Elements (BQE) to determine the water quality. In the present research, we studied the zooplankton species that can be considered as indicators of trophic status and ecological potential for more than 60 water reservoirs. The data were obtained from more of 300 samples collected during 10 years from reservoirs at Ebro River watershed, which is the largest basin in Spain. According to their physicochemical and biological elements, the trophic status and ecological potential of these reservoirs were established. More than 150 zooplankton species were identified during the study. The results from this research indicate that species that are related with low water quality are: Acanthocyclops americanus, Ceriodaphnia spp., Daphnia cucullata, Daphnia párvula, Diaphanosoma brachyurum, Brachionus angularis, Keratella cochlearis and Phompolyx sulcata. An indicator of moderate quality was Bosmina longirostris, while Daphnia longispina, Ascomorpha ovalis and Ascomorpha saltans were considered as indicators of good water quality. The data obtained suggest that zooplankton species can be used as a valuable tool to determine the water quality status and should be considered, in a near future, as one more of the BQE within the WFD metrics.

T1  - Long-term zooplankton composition data reveal impacts of invasions on community composition in the Waikato lakes, New Zealand
AN  - 2584866028
AB  - Data collected on zooplankton community composition over longer time periods (> 10 years) are rare. We examined among-lake spatial and temporal trends of zooplankton communities from a monitoring programme undertaken in the Waikato region, New Zealand. A total of 39 lakes were sampled over a period of 12 years, between 2007 and 2019, with varying degrees of temporal effort. We focussed particularly on eight lakes, considered here as ‘long-term lakes’, where samples were collected with greater regularity (including 5 with 12 years of data). Among lakes, suspended sediment concentrations and indicators of lake trophic state were inferred to be important in determining the zooplankton distributions; as this region is dominated by shallow lakes, the relative importance of suspended sediments was high. Among the long-term lakes, the greatest dissimilarities in zooplankton community composition among years were in Lake Waahi, where the Australian Boeckella symmetrica was first detected in 2012. That is, the greatest temporal changes to zooplankton composition during the study period were due to the invasion by non-indigenous species, rather than changes in trophic state or other environmental variables; non-native species commonly dominated the individual counts of species through much of 2014 and 2015, with most samples since 2016 being again dominated by native species. Following this lake, the largest and shallowest lakes in the dataset—Whangape and Waikare—exhibited the greatest variability in community composition among years.

T1  - Early presence of <i>Bythotrephes cederströmii</i> (Cladocera: Cercopagidae) in lake sediments in North America: evidence or artifact?
AN  - 2584612345
AB  - The spiny water flea (Bythotrephes cederströmii), a freshwater crustacean considered to be the world’s best-studied invasive zooplankter, was first recorded in North America in the Laurentian Great Lakes during the 1980s. Its arrival is widely considered to be the result of ocean-going cargo ships that translocated contaminated ballast water from Eurasia to the Great Lakes during the 1970–1980s. The subsequent first discovery of the species in inland lakes is consistent with the hypothesis that propagules dispersed initially from established Great Lakes populations. Here we present evidence of exoskeletal remains, including mandibles, tail spines, and resting eggs, in 210Pb-dated lake sediment cores, which suggests that B. cederströmii was already resident in four inland North American lakes (two in Minnesota, USA; two in Ontario, Canada) by at least the early 1900s. Densities of exoskeletal remains were low and relatively steady from first appearance until about 1990, after which time they increased in all cores. The earliest evidence that we found was a mandible at 33-cm depth (pre-1650) in the sediments of Three Mile Lake, Ontario, Canada. These unexpected findings challenge the current paradigm of B. cederströmii invasion, renew uncertainty about the timing and sequence of its colonization of North American lakes, and potentially question our ability to detect invasive species with traditional sampling methods. We attempted to eliminate errors in the dated stratigraphies of the exoskeletal remains that might have been introduced either methodologically (e.g., core-wall smearing) or naturally (e.g., bioturbation). Nonetheless, given the very low numbers of subfossils encountered, questions remain about the possible artifactual nature of our observations and therefore we regard our results as ‘preliminary findings’ at this time.

T1  - Epigenetic variation in animal populations: Sources, extent, phenotypic implications, and ecological and evolutionary relevance
AN  - 2495703100
AB  - Laboratory experiments and fieldwork with asexually reproducing invertebrates and vertebrates clearly revealed that animal populations can produce substantial phenotypic variation despite genetic identity. This epigenetically caused phenotypic variation comes from two different sources, namely directional environmental induction and bed-hedging developmental stochasticity. Both occur together and are mediated by molecular epigenetic mechanisms like DNA methylation, histone modifications and microRNAs. These epigenetic mechanisms are also involved in insect polyphenism, phenotypic changes in early domestication, and gene expression change and chromatin rearrangement during speciation. Epigenetic variation is particularly important for asexual populations helping them to stay in the game of life when the environmental conditions change. However, it is also relevant for sexually reproducing populations, as shown for genetically impoverished invasive groups, cave animals and sessile taxa that cannot evade unfavourable environmental conditions. Experiments revealed that epigenetic marks can be transgenerationally inherited and persist for several generations. First evidence suggests that inherited epimutations with phenotypic effects may end-up in phenotype-fixing genetic mutations by accelerated mutation of methylated nucleotides. Refined concepts, suitable animal models, fast and affordable new omics techniques that require only small tissue samples, and appropriate data interpretation tools are now available enabling future investigations in ecological and evolutionary epigenetics with high accuracy.

T1  - Declining Recruitment of Lake Whitefish to Fisheries in the Laurentian Great Lakes: Management Considerations and Research Priorities
AN  - 2639737966
AB  - We conducted a review of the physical and biological processes that affect recruitment of Lake Whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) to commercial fisheries in the Laurentian Great Lakes because numerous stocks have declined precipitously since contemporary abundance and yield peaked in the late 1990s. Lake Whitefish recruitment dynamics are largely defined in nearshore high-energy zones <7 m deep where gametes are deposited in fall and fertilized embryos incubate over winter. Reproductive habitat constitutes about 2% of the total surface area of the Great Lakes, with most of it in Lake Huron, and over 75% of it in embayments. Lake Whitefish also spawns in tributaries, particularly those to Green Bay, Lake Michigan, and these stocks have expanded over the last decade in comparison to stocks in the lake's main basin, which have declined. Water temperatures of the Great Lakes have been increasing through time, reducing the density and duration of ice cover, which is important for protecting embryos from currents generated by strong winds. The amount and extent of ice cover has been declining since the late 1990s, and this trend will continue, negatively affecting recruitment. The role of water levels in recruitment remains unknown, but shallow nursery areas in embayments will be most affected by changing water levels. At least 93 reproductive habitats occur in the Great Lakes, and adult Lake Whitefish live mainly within a 110-km radius of their spawning shoals. Consequently, fishery yields comprise multiple spawning stocks that differ in their reproductive productivity. We identified 24 potential management areas where commercial-fishery and biological data can be pooled from adjacent spawning stocks into a single larger mixed-stock fishery assessment, which should produce less-biased estimates of spawning-stock biomass than if individual stocks were treated as though mixing did not occur. The 2003 to 2012 year-classes, produced at high levels of adult abundance, experienced the greatest declines in recruitment. The number of recruits per kilogram of spawners declined 76-80% in Lakes Michigan and Huron but doubled in Lake Superior. Correspondence between larval density and subsequent year-class production appears to be uncorrelated, but the relationship is likely driven by the ratio of zooplankton density to larval density. Abundant calanoid and cyclopoid copepods in waters <7 m deep during late March through early May are critical for growth and survival of larvae. Based on distribution in fall and winter, Round Goby (Neogobius melanostomus) may not negatively affect Lake Whitefish reproduction. We conclude that predation of Lake Whitefish by Lake Trout (Salvelinus namaycush) has not been a cause of the declines in recruitment. Although Sea Lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) kills adult Lake Whitefish, it also is not a cause of the recent declines in recruitment. Pathogens and parasites may have played a role in the decline in Lake Whitefish stocks in the Great Lakes. Changes in the food web of the four lower Great Lakes due to expansion of dreissenids (Dreissena polymorpha and D. bugensis) have probably affected the physical and biological productivity of Lake Whitefish reproductive habitat, but the specific mechanism(s) remains unknown. Spawning biomass appears sufficient to support both recruitment and fisheries, but survival of early life stages is insufficient, suggesting that carrying capacity of reproductive habitats has been degraded during 2000-2019. We do not view stocking as an effective tool for managing Lake Whitefish in the Great Lakes, but if stocking is to be undertaken, agencies must ensure that stocked fish can be distinguished from naturally produced fish at all life stages. We recommend that managers on Lakes Michigan, Huron, and Ontario establish a Lake Whitefish working group; give high priority to research targeted at estimating the unfished biomass of stocks; create areas that provide additional protection from exploitation for a portion of the year; provide the least-productive stocks additional protections from exploitation; reduce current levels of exploitation on the most highly fished stocks; expand the length of spawning-season closures or implement a spawning-season closure, if one does not exist; and reduce the maximum-total-mortality-control rule to less than 65% where it is used to set harvest limits. Lastly, we recommend the creation of a small-scale dreissenid control program with the goal of increasing primary production and Lake Whitefish recruitment in reproductive habitats of Lakes Michigan, Huron, and Ontario.

T1  - Invasive lionfish detected in estuaries in the northern Gulf of Mexico using environmental DNA
AN  - 2602328378
AB  - Invasive lionfish are considered to be one of the worst marine invaders primarily due to their threat as predators to native species. The distribution of lionfish across their invasive range has been fairly well characterized, but their presence within estuaries is largely unknown. While removal of invasive lionfish is the primary mode of managing the invasion, early detection in new locations could be valuable for documenting range expansion. Environmental DNA (eDNA) has become a useful tool to identify the presence of invasive species prior to establishment and may be especially valuable for systems that are challenging to survey. In this study, an environmental DNA assay was developed and successfully identified the presence of lionfish DNA in four riverine estuaries in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Detections were significantly higher in July but did not vary by location. Occupancy modeling shows that the assay is not exceptionally sensitive and may be underreporting the presence of lionfish, possibly due to the effect of salinity. The presence of invasive lionfish within estuaries could put native fish and invertebrates at risk, especially species that use these systems as nurseries. Ongoing monitoring using molecular methods may be useful in the management of invasive lionfish by providing early detection of fish moving into systems that neighbor known invaded regions.

T1  - Mussel biology: from the byssus to ecology and physiology, including microplastic ingestion and deep-sea adaptations
AN  - 2595784006
AB  - Mussels are a group of bivalves that includes the dominant species of shallow-sea, freshwater, and deep-sea chemosynthetic ecosystems. Mussels cling to various solid underwater surfaces using a proteinaceous thread, called the byssus, which is central to their ecology, physiology, and evolution. Mussels cluster using their byssi to form “mussel beds,” thereby increasing their biomass per unit of habitat area, and also creating habitats for other organisms. Clustered mussels actively filter feed to obtain nutrients, but also ingest pollutants and suspended particles; thus, mussels are good subjects for pollution analyses, especially for microplastic pollution. The byssus also facilitates invasiveness, allowing mussels to hitchhike on ships, and to utilize other man-made structures, including quay walls and power plant inlets, which are less attractive to native species. Physiologically, mussels have adapted to environmental stressors associated with a sessile lifestyle. Osmotic adaptation is especially important for life in intertidal zones, and taurine is a major component of that adaptation. Taurine accumulation systems have also been modified to adapt to sulfide-rich environments near deep-sea hydrothermal vents. The byssus may have also enabled access to vent environments, allowing mussels to attach to “evolutionary stepping stones” and also to vent chimneys.

T1  - Geographic variation of mercury in breeding tidal marsh sparrows of the northeastern United States
AN  - 2588177294
AB  - Saltmarsh sparrows (Ammospiza caudacuta) and seaside sparrows (A. maritima) are species of conservation concern primarily due to global sea-level rise and habitat degradation. Environmental mercury (Hg) contamination may present additional threats to their reproductive success and survival. To assess site-specific total mercury (THg) exposure and identify environmental correlates of THg detection, we sampled blood from adult male saltmarsh and seaside sparrows at 27 sites between Maine and Virginia, USA. The mean THg concentration (±1 SD) throughout the entire sampling range was 0.531 ± 0.287 µg/g wet weight (ww) for saltmarsh sparrows and 0.442 ± 0.316 µg/g ww for seaside sparrows. Individual THg concentrations ranged from 0.135–1.420 µg/g ww for saltmarsh sparrows and 0.153–1.530 µg/g ww for seaside sparrows. Model averaging from a suite of linear mixed models showed that saltmarsh sparrows averaged 20.1% higher blood THg concentrations than seaside sparrows, potentially due to differences in diet or foraging behavior. We found no evidence for a relationship between sparrow THg concentrations and land cover surrounding sampled marshes or average precipitation-based Hg deposition. Overall, our results suggest considerable, unexplained variation in tidal marsh sparrow blood THg concentrations over their co-occurring breeding ranges.

T1  - Ecosystem services and impact of industrial pollution on urban health: evidence from Durgapur, West Bengal, India
AN  - 2584640096
AB  - Industrialization, urbanization, and rapid socioeconomic growth are the prime factors regarding development of an urban city. These activities deteriorate the environment slowly by increasing harmful pollutants and the impact of which will be observed in near future in terms of several natural calamities, disease, and ecological consequences. Various urban ecosystems like urban forestry, wetland, grassland, parks/gardens etc. are the main criteria of urban health in respect to delivering multiple of benefits to the surrounding biota. But these regulatory systems have been affected severely through different industrial pollution stresses resulting into deterioration of their physicochemical quality and biotic diversity. The study revealed that the annual average air pollution index (API) exceeded the higher threshold value (i.e. >100) during the study period and recognized Durgapur as the severely polluted region in West Bengal, India. The characteristics of major air pollutants like SO2, NOx, and suspended particulate matter (SPM) and their temporal trends have been evaluated. The objective of this study was to detect the effect of industrial pollution on the aforesaid urban ecosystems in terms of variable ecological services such as purification of polluted air, atmospheric regulation, reduction of noise, proper drainage of rainwater, and sewage treatment. The outcome of this review work was to evaluate thoroughly the physiological, biochemical, and morphological symptoms of plant species under air pollution stress. On the other hand, the effect of air pollution on human and animal populations regarding various diseases (like bronchitis, cardiopulmonary arrest, cancer, liver and kidney dysfunction) has also been discussed.

T1  - Occurrence, spatial distribution, and fate of polycyclic musks in sediments from the catchment of Chaohu Lake, China
AN  - 2582477169
AB  - Twenty-nine surface sediments from Chaohu Lake in China and from its six main tributaries were sampled to investigate the concentrations of two important polycyclic musks (PCMs), 1,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydro-4,6,6,7,8,8-hexamethylcyclopenta(g)-2-benzopyran (galaxolide, HHCB) and 7-acetyl-1,1,3,4,4,6-hexamethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene (tonalide, AHTN), as well as the concentration of 4,6,7,8-hexahydro-4,6,6,7,8,8-hexamethylcyclopenta(g)-2-benzopyran-1-one (galaxolidon, HHCB-lactone), which is the main degradation product of HHCB. Except for the high concentrations of AHTN and HHCB measured in the Nanfei River (879 ng/g dw and 5,513 ng/g dw, respectively), the levels of AHTN and HHCB in the river sediments were 7.08–44.9 ng/g dw and 20.6–268 ng/g dw, respectively, which are slightly lower than those documented in various areas worldwide. The concentrations of AHTN and HHCB in the sediments of Chaohu Lake were one or two orders of magnitude lower than those in the tributary rivers and showed a clear regional distribution. The concentrations of HHCB-lactone were comparable to those of HHCB and presented a significant positive correlation with the concentrations of HHCB, suggesting that the HHCB-lactone originated directly from the degradation of HHCB in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) or in the natural environment. The diagnostic ratios of HHCB/AHTN and HHCB-lactone/HHCB and the enantiomeric fractions (EFs) of these PCMs showed that the direct origins of the target PCMs in the study area were municipal and industrial wastewaters discharged from adjacent cities or point sources and that the HHCB-lactone in sediment originated from the natural degradation of HHCB in the rivers and the lake. The results of the risk assessment showed that the PCMs in the watershed sediments were unlikely to pose a threat to aquatic species. However, the effluents of industrial and municipal wastewaters that are discharged into the Nanfei River should be investigated in future research.

T1  - Redistribution of the lizardfish <i>Harpadon nehereus</i> in coastal waters of China due to climate change
AN  - 2578264322
AB  - Climate change has the potential to greatly alter species distributions and threatens biodiversity in marine ecosystems. Mapping changes in species distribution patterns under climate change will help facilitate management strategies to maintain ecosystem structure and function. The lizardfish Harpadon nehereus is an aggressive predator that has experienced rapid population growth along the coast of China in recent decades, compressing the ecological niches of other marine species and disrupting food webs. If this species’ range is shifting due to climate change, it could further impact the integrity of ecological communities. To map the distribution of H. nehereus, we developed an ensemble species distribution model and projected the present and future habitat suitability in Chinese coastal waters. Annual mean benthic water temperature was identified as the most important variable affecting the projected distribution of H. nehereus, followed by water depth and salinity. Currently suitable habitats are along the coast from Guangxi Province to the southern Jiangsu Province. As climate changes, the southern portion of its distribution is predicted to recede with habitat losses, and the overall suitable habitat will shift northward. To avoid the potential impacts of H. nehereus redistribution, precautionary management based on species distribution modeling would help to maintain healthy marine ecosystems in the newly invaded areas.

T1  - Long-term trends in CPUE and relative weight of six fish species in the Wabash River, USA, prior to and following silver carp invasion
AN  - 2575154420
AB  - Silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) dispersed to the Wabash River, Indiana in the mid-1990s. These fish compete with native, filter-feeding fish species in other central US rivers but relatively little information is available for impacts in the Wabash River. We collected fishes by boat electrofisher on the Wabash River as part of a long-term study. Abundances of six Wabash River species varied temporally, and three had stronger relationships with year than the other species: common carp (Cyprinus carpio) decreased before and after silver carp introduction, freshwater drum (Aplodinotus grunniens) increased prior to silver carp introduction, and gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum) decreased before silver carp introduction. Silver carp abundance was significantly correlated only with abundance of gizzard shad. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis of long-term Wabash River fish assemblages resulted in distinctive temporal and spatial patterns. Silver carp abundance increased from zero in the early 1990s to 28 individuals/km in recent years. Gizzard shad declined to low abundance simultaneous to silver carp increases, yet we did not detect significant patterns for silver carp with other Wabash River fishes.

T1  - Ontogenetic Diet Shift, Feeding Ecology, and Trophic Niches of the Redspot Chub (Cypriniformes: Cyprinidae: Nocomis asper)
AN  - 2630530447
AB  - Redspot Chub (Nocomis asper) are a keystone species in Ozark Highland streams of the Arkansas River drainage because their unique mound-building reproductive behavior facilitates recruitment of nest associates. Data contributing to an increased understanding of Redspot Chub natural history is required for the conservation of this species as it is listed as a species of concern throughout most its range. The findings presented within thoroughly describe Redspot Chub feeding ecology by documenting an ontogenetic diet shift, patterns of seasonal resource use, important prey taxa, estimates of trophic position and dietary niche breadth, as well as documenting feeding strategies at population and individual levels. Diet collections were conducted seasonally in 2018 and 2019 at four sites on Spavinaw Creek in Arkansas and Oklahoma. Logistic regression provided evidence for a previously undescribed ontogenetic diet shift, which split Redspot Chub into two functionally different species from a dietary perspective. Redspot Chub >162 mm total length (TL, RSCB) occupied a significantly higher trophic level than Redspot Chub <162 mm TL (RSCS). In terms of caloric contribution, Ringed Crayfish (Faxonius neglectus neglectus) nearly accounted for the entire diet of RSCB, regardless of season. This specialization led to a much lower overall dietary niche breadth when compared to RSCS. Furthermore, Amundsen plots clearly depicted RSCB population specialization on crayfish. Conversely, Trichoptera were the most important prey across seasons for RSCS. Coleóptera, Ringed Crayfish, and Ephemeroptera ranked second in importance at different times seasonally. RSCS also possessed a relatively narrow niche width, but Amundsen plots exhibited a pattern where seasonally the two most important prey types were specialized on by approximately half the population, while smaller proportions of the population specialized on less commonly used prey resources. Species' diets reflect an integration of numerous ecological components; therefore, our aim was to provide a greater understanding of Redspot Chub feeding ecology that may be useful for informing future conservation assessments and management decisions.

T1  - Evaluation of the genotoxic potential of water impacted by acid mine drainage from a coal mine in Mpumalanga, South Africa, using the Ames test and Comet assay
AN  - 2609424101
AB  - Several potential genotoxins found in water samples arise from anthropogenic activities. Acid mine effluent resulting from coal mining poses serious environment concerns all over the world. The use of toxicity tests to evaluate the quality of streams add value by providing site-specific toxicological data. Treatment systems such as the use of natural wetlands (passive) or conventional physical and chemical pH-neutralised processes (active) are employed mainly to meet certain water quality guidelines. Nonetheless, potential genotoxins or residues remain which influence the quality of discharged effluents. The objective of this study was to evaluate the genotoxic potential of acid mine drainage (AMD) released into a natural stream following treatment by passive and active methods. This study aimed to identify the extent of AMD mutagenicity and genotoxicity to African Vero monkey kidney cell line and a fish gill cell line (RTgill-W1) using two assays, the Ames test, and the comet assay, as a rapid and effective screening tool. The Ames test performed without metabolic activation using Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 strains showed no indication of mutagenicity in the water samples tested. Differing results were however obtained for the comet assay using the African Vero monkey kidney cell line and a fish gill cell line (RTgill-W1), which revealed DNA fragmentation and variations in morphologies indicative of genotoxicity in the water samples following the two treatment processes. A significant reduction in DNA damage was observed in water samples following active treatment of the AMD, evidenced by reduced damage frequency and a lowered comet score. This bioassay confirms the urgency of integrating high-throughput screening in aquatic toxicity assessment at genetic levels, giving further evidence that in-vitro bioassays can be incorporated for use in short-term genotoxicity assays. The result suggests that the comet assay proved sensitive at detecting genotoxicity, supporting the integration of this into environmental monitoring frameworks targeted at AMD-contaminated sites.

T1  - Stock Size Assessment, Distribution and Biology of the Surf Clam <i>Mactra stultorum</i> (Mollusca: Bivalvia) Along the Sfax Coasts (Tunisia, Mediterranean Sea)
AN  - 2576854957
AB  - Mactra stultorum is one of the most abundant bivalve species along the Tunisian coast. Its current exploitation status represents a major concern for the fishing industry in Tunisia. This study investigates the stock distribution, population structure and some environmental parameters associated with M. stultorum. The obtained results reveal that this bivalve had significant density variation in the study area. The stock density ranged from 0 to 30 ind m−2, and biomass values varied from 0 to 206 g m−2. A remarkable biomass of 71.7 ± 23.5 tons and high abundance reaching 11.7 ± 3.9 million individuals was estimated in area of 4182 ha. The individuals ranged in size from 6 to 38.5 mm. The overall sex ratio (F:M) was 1:1.37, which significantly deviated from parity (1:1). It was noticed that several abiotic parameters (seawater temperature and salinity as well as sediment type and organic matter content) affected considerably the spread of the clam species. If managed properly, the clam is expected to meet the domestic market demand through artisanal fishery.

T1  - Diffusive gradients in thin films for the measurement of labile metal species in water and soils: a review
AN  - 2573636706
AB  - The determination of the concentration of an environmental pollutant is not sufficient to assess the related health risk because this pollutant may not be bioavailable. Therefore, methods to determine pollutant bioavailability are more relevant to assess toxicity than measuring the total concentration. For instance, the diffusive gradient in thin films (DGT) is an in situ dynamic technique used to measure the concentration of labile compounds in the environment. Here we review the latest developments achieved in speciation and bioavailability of metals and metalloids using this technique. We detail the technique, common binding agents and diffusive gels. We give laboratory procedures to prepare the gels, and we explain calculations using the DGT-induced fluxes in soils (DIFS) modeling. DIFS models can predict the resupply capacities from soils to porewater, and the uptake of trace elements by plants. Procedures for in situ field deployments, including issues of biofilm growth, are also discussed.

T1  - The Effect of Microplastics on the Bioenergetics of the Mussel Mytilus coruscus Assessed by Cellular Energy Allocation Approach
AN  - 2568300718
AB  - Marine microplastics pollution is a major environmental concern in marine ecosystems worldwide, yet the biological impacts of microplastics on the coastal biota are not yet fully understood. We investigated the impact of suspended microplastics on the energy budget of the mussels Mytilus coruscus using the Cellular Energy Allocation (CEA) approach. The mussels were exposed to control conditions (no microplastics) or to one of the three concentrations of 2 μm polystyrene microspheres (10, 104, and 106 particles/L) for 14 days, followed by 7 days of recovery. Exposure to high concentrations of microplastics (104 or 106 particles/L) increased cellular energy demand (measured as the activity of the mitochondrial electron transport system, ETS) and depleted cellular energy stores (carbohydrates, lipids and proteins) in the mussels whereas exposure to 10 particles/L had no effect. Carbohydrate levels decreased already after 7 days of microplastics exposure and were restored after 7 days of recovery. In contrast, the tissue levels of lipids and proteins declined more slowly (after 14 days of exposure) and did not fully recover after 7 days following the removal of microplastics. Therefore, the total energy content and the CEA declined after 7-14 days of exposure to high microplastics concentrations, and remained suppressed during 7 days of subsequent recovery. These findings demonstrate a negative impact of microplastics on energy metabolism at the cellular level that cannot be restored during a short time recovery. Given a close link of CEA with the organismal energy balance, suppression of CEA by microplastics exposure suggests that bioenergetics disturbances might lead to decreases in growth and productivity of mussels’ populations in environments with heavy microplastics loads.

T1  - Evaluation of the Carbon Nanostructures Toxicity as a Function of Their Dimensionality Using Model Organisms: a Review
AN  - 2565729027
AB  - Nanotechnology has been widely used, with nanomaterials being applied in several technologies. However, little is known about the real toxicological risk that can be caused by nanomaterials. These materials can be divided according to their dimensionalities. The current classification schemes for nanostructured materials are based on these dimensionalities, generally as zero (0D), one (1D), two (2D), and three dimensions (3D). Toxicological studies to present broad and consistent information on nanomaterials toxicity mechanisms, in vitro and in vivo studies in several experimental models are necessary. Thus, this short review presents the toxicological potential of carbon nanomaterials, divided by their dimensionality, in the main in vitro and in vivo experimental models, especially alternative models. As a result, it was possible to observe that the toxicity of carbon nanomaterials does not vary according to the dimensionality of 0D, 1D, and 2D materials. For these materials, it is not possible to infer a direct relationship between dimensionality and toxicity. However, recent studies have shown that three-dimensional graphene species tend to have less toxicity than materials with a smaller number of dimensions. Finally, it was possible to note the importance of using several experimental models, especially alternative models, in order to increase the understanding of toxicity mechanisms of carbon nanomaterials.

T1  - Risk assessment and ecotoxicological diagnosis of soil from a chemical industry park in Nanjing, China
AN  - 2563568429
AB  - Soil pollution due to the activities of industrial parks, is becoming an increasingly serious issue, particularly throughout China. Therefore, it is essential to explore the soil pollution characteristics and its ecotoxicological effects on model species, such as higher plant species, in typical industrial areas. In this study, concentrations of heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were examined in the soil collected from 10 sampling sites at a chemical industry park in Nanjing, China. The pollution index was used to assess the heavy metal pollution level of soils, while the hazard index (HI) and carcinogenic risk index (RI) were calculated to assess the human health risk of soil PAHs. In addition, wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was used as the model species to evaluate the ecotoxicological effects of polluted soil in pot experiments. Results showed that the content of heavy metals and PAHs varied greatly in soil samples, among which the heavy metal pollution at S1, S2 and S3 was the most serious. The health risk assessment of PAHs indicated that non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic values for all soil samples were below the threshold levels. Statistical analysis of the correlation between contaminated soil and toxic effects in wheat found that the significance values of regression equations were all less than 0.05 for chlorophyll content, peroxidase (POD) and amylase (AMS) activity. This indicates that the chlorophyll content, POD and AMS activity in wheat leaves could be suitable biomarkers for evaluation of the combined toxicity of multiple pollutants. This study provides a reference for future research on the risk assessment of soil containing multiple pollutants from industrial chemical parks.

T1  - Allometric relationships in the filtration rates of the Asian clam <i>Corbicula fluminea</i> fed two phytoplankton species
AN  - 2559154693
AB  - Filtration rates (FRs) of the invasive Asian clam C. fluminea of various sizes ranging from 0.5 to 4.5 g whole-body weight were experimentally assessed under controlled laboratory conditions using two phytoplankton species of different sizes and biovolumes (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata) as food. Overall, the FRs ranged from 0 to 347 mL g−1 h−1 (median value: 52 mL g−1 h−1). We found no statistical difference (p > 0.05) between the two phytoplankton species used, nor did we find a significant relationship between individual FRs (mL individual−1 h−1) and wet weight (WW) or shell length (SL). However, we did find a significant negative relationship between FRs (mL g−1 h−1) and WW in clams fed on C. reinhardtii and P. subcapitata (FR = 131 WW−1.05 and FR = 203 WW−1.28, respectively), indicating that smaller (younger) individuals had a higher FR than larger (older) individuals in the tested range of particle size (i.e., 4–6 µm diameter). Such results highlight the strong influence of size/age on the filtration rate of C. fluminea and provide new insights to better understand the invasive capacity of this species.

T1  - Shell morphology, growth and longevity of <i>Unio tumidus</i> (Bivalvia: Unionidae) from an archaeological site and contemporary population inhabiting the Oder estuary
AN  - 2546790151
AB  - Mussel shells are often found in archaeological excavations and can provide information useful for ecological reconstruction and assessment of anthropogenic impact on waters. In this study, two sample groups of swollen river mussel (Unio tumidus) which occurred during the Early Middle Ages (EMS) and currently (MS) in the Oder river estuary (Baltic basin) were compared. Allometric shell growth, morphological characteristics of the shell (length, width, height and thickness), age structure and growth of mussels were analysed using the von Bertalanffy equation. All three types of allometric growth (isometry and both positive and negative allometry) were observed in the studied mussels. In both groups, typical values of shell length, width, height and thickness were recorded. However, higher values of these morphological characteristics were recorded in the EMS group. Moreover, the EMS group, compared with the MS group of U. tumidus, was characterised by a higher longevity (12 and 10 years, respectively) and asymmetric length (L∞) (93.09 and 83.23 mm, respectively). Both groups of mussels had a similar growth rate (k). Larger shell sizes in the EMS group were probably caused by differential preservation and/or differential archaeological recovery, and resulted from differences in the age structure, especially higher mortality rate amongst individuals older than 6 years in the MS group.

T1  - Measuring the Impact of the COVID-19 Shutdown on Great Lakes Water Quality Using Remote Sensing
AN  - 2563969026
AB  - The states of Michigan and Ohio issued shutdown orders in mid-March 2020 in an attempt to slow the spread of COVID-19, resulting in widespread disruption to economic and human activity. This study, which was commissioned by NASA headquarters, utilized satellite remote sensing data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) satellite to investigate whether these changes in activity led to any short-term changes in water quality in the Great Lakes region by comparing 2020 data to a historic baseline. The water quality parameters examined included chlorophyll-a (CHL) and total suspended solids (TSS) concentrations, water clarity, and harmful algal bloom (HAB) extent. These parameters were investigated in two Great Lakes basins which experience significant anthropogenic pressure: the western basin of Lake Erie (WBLE) and Saginaw Bay in Lake Huron (SBLH). TSS concentrations in April 2020 were below the historic baseline in both basins, and largely remained low until September. SBLH also experienced elevated CHL concentrations in April which persisted through the summer. Additionally, the WBLE HAB extent was down in 2020 after an early end to the growing season. However, this investigation found that the COVID-19 shutdowns were likely not a direct driver of these short-term anomalies. Instead, recent trends in the indicators and co-occurring anomalies in hydrological and meteorological conditions (e.g., lake temperature, river discharge, and wind speed) appeared to be more responsible for the detected water quality changes. Future work will investigate whether the shutdowns have a long-term or delayed impact on Great Lakes water quality.

T1  - Reproduction Under Stress: Acute Effect of Low Salinities and Heat Waves on Reproductive Cycle of Four Ecologically and Commercially Important Bivalves
AN  - 2557302275
AB  - Given the ecological and socioeconomic importance of estuaries, the impacts of climate change on their structure and functioning is a major focus of concern, even more when the affected species support important fisheries as the venerid clams Ruditapes decussatus, R. philippinarum, Venerupis corrugata, and the cockle Cerastoderma edule in Europe whose reproductive performance, in the context of climate stressors, has not yet been investigated. Thus, our objective was to experimentally evaluate the potential effect of low salinity and atmospheric heatwave stresses on their reproductive cycle. To test it, bivalves were exposed during six days to four different salinity ramps (5-20, 10-25, 15-30, 30-30) during simulated tidal cycles over three different periods of the year (autumn, winter and spring); also, in summer, they were exposed to atmospheric heatwaves at low tide (20, 27, 32, 37°C) during four consecutive days. Histological slides were analyzed to determine their gametogenetic stage and a gonadal index was calculated. Both low salinity and heatwave stresses compromised reproduction but the response was species-specific dependent and varied with the time of the year, therefore with the gametogenic cycle. In December, during sexual resting and the beginning of gametogenesis, a delay in the gametogenesis was recorded in the four species at lower salinities. In March and May, at the peak of the reproductive period, the response was different; abnormal oocytes in R. decussatus and resorption of gametes with hemocytic infiltration in R. philippinarum and V. corrugata were observed. Sediment temperatures higher than 32ºC provoked gonadal resorption and severe hemocytic invasion in V. corrugata, R. decussatus and C. edule but no effect in R. philippinarum. These responses were related to the allocation of energy from reproduction towards defense and repair mechanisms to ensure survival. Contrastingly, low salinities triggered massive spawning in C. edule that could lead to a mismatch between the presence of larvae and phytoplankton, causing potentially starvation and thus reducing recruitment success. For short-lived species as these bivalves if low salinity episodes in winter and spring are followed by a heatwave in summer, reproduction would be compromised, and the impact magnified if this situation happens during consecutive years

T1  - Protective effects of astaxanthin from <i>Haematococcus pluvialis</i> on the survival and oxidative stress of zebrafish embryos induced by microcystin-LR
AN  - 2555783417
AB  - This study evaluated the individual effects of microcystin-LR (MC-LR) with different concentrations (0, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 μg L−1) and the combined influences with astaxanthin (10 and 100 μg L−1) from Haematococcus pluvialis on the survival and oxidative stress of zebrafish embryos. Results showed that the reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), mortality and deformity rate were increased in the presence of MC-LR accompanied with the reduction of the glutathione peroxidase (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and hatching rate of the zebrafish embryo. The higher the MC-LR concentration was, the stronger the developmental and oxidative stress response (p < 0.05). This study confirmed that the supplementation of astaxanthin could significantly alleviate the toxic effects of MC-LR on zebrafish embryos. The mortality and deformity rates decreased significantly in the combined exposure group compared with the only MC-LR exposure group, and the decreasing rates were positively correlated with the astaxanthin concentration. Astaxanthin could also significantly improve the oxidative stress response and damage caused by MC-LR. The ROS and MDA contents of juvenile fish decreased, whereas GSH, SOD and T-AOC increased significantly with astaxanthin supplementation. Therefore, astaxanthin might be a suitable diet supplement against the MC-LR contamination of pond aquaculture.

T1  - Nuclei isolation protocols for flow cytometry allowing nuclear DNA content estimation in problematic microalgal groups
AN  - 2555783363
AB  - Microalgae are fundamentally important organisms for global ecosystem functioning with high potential in biotechnology and its applications. The knowledge of their nuclear DNA content has become a prerequisite for many areas of microalgal research. Due to common presence of various pigments, secondary metabolites and complex cell walls, the nuclear DNA content estimation using flow cytometry (FCM) is, however, often laborious or even impossible with the currently used protocols. In this study the performance of six nuclei isolation protocols was compared on various problematic microalgae using FCM. The nuclei isolation methods involved osmotic bursting of cells, razor blade chopping of fresh biomass and two newly introduced protocols, razor blade chopping of desiccated biomass and bead beating. These techniques also involved the use of two different nuclei isolation solutions, Otto I + II solutions, and LB01 buffer. Performance of the particular protocols differed greatly, depending on the used nuclei isolation solution and microalgal group. The most successful method was a newly adopted chopping of desiccated biomass in LB01 buffer. This method seems more appropriate for nuclei isolation in filamentous microalgae; on the other hand, bead beating appears to be more suitable for nuclei isolation in solitarily living algae. Using the optimal protocol for a given species, their nuclear DNA content was estimated, resulting in first DNA content estimates for four investigated taxa (Chlamydomonas noctigama, Gonyostomum semen, Microglena sp. and Stigeoclonium sp.). The estimated DNA content spanned from 0.15 to 32.52 pg.

T1  - Insulin-like growth factor signalling and its significance as a biomarker in fish and shellfish research
AN  - 2554499656
AB  - The insulin-like growth factor signalling system comprises insulin-like growth factors, insulin-like growth factor receptors and insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins. Along with the growth hormones, insulin-like growth factor signalling is very pivotal in the growth and development of all vertebrates. In fishes, insulin-like growth factors play an important role in osmoregulation, besides the neuroendocrine regulation of growth. Insulin-like growth factor concentration in plasma can assess the growth in fishes and shellfishes and therefore widely applied in nutritional research as an indicator to evaluate the performance of selected nutrients. The present review summarizes the role of insulin-like growth factor signalling in fishes and shellfishes, its significance in aquaculture and in evaluating growth, reproduction and development, and discusses the utility of this system as biomarkers for early indication of growth in aquaculture.

T1  - Population characteristics of the non-indigenous round goby, Neogobius melanostomus (Actinopterygii: Perciformes: Gobiidae), in the eastern Gulf of Finland
AN  - 2580355435
AB  - The round goby, Neogobius melanostomus (Pallas, 1814), is a fish of Ponto-Caspian origin that has been invading the Baltic Sea since the 1990s. Currently, it is abundant and commercially important in some areas of the sea. This species was first reported in the eastern Gulf of Finland (GoF) in 2012. Its occurrence increased thereafter, however it has remained largely unstudied in this region. The aim of this study was to investigate the population characteristics of the round goby in the eastern GoF to better understand its expansion trend and whether it will become abundant enough to be exploited by the local fishery. Fish were caught using multi-mesh gillnets (12-60 mm mesh) and a beach seine (0.5-10 mm mesh). Occurrence, density, catch per unit effort, biomass per unit effort, relative number and biomass in catches, as well as age, size and sex ratio were studied. The species regularly occurred in samplings along the southern coastline of the GoF, as well as some central areas and along the northern coast. Within 2012-2019, its occurrence in catches increased, with the highest frequency in 2015-2019 in shallow waters (<1.5 m) of Koporye Bay (70%) and in the deeper waters of Narva Bay (74%). Similarly, the highest density in the shallow waters was also observed in Koporye Bay (10.0 ind. * 100 m-2), and offshore in Narva Bay. Relative abundance and biomass usually did not exceed 23%, although it reached 93% in Narva Bay. The oldest specimen was five years old. Young-of-the-year (YOY) juveniles predominated in the shallow waters (85%), while three-year-olds prevailed in deeper waters (75%). Among the fish older than two years, females were more predominant (mean ratio 3 to 1), and males were larger than females. Specimens in all life stages were found in the eastern GoF, and their abundance increased annually, suggesting that the round goby has successfully colonized this region of the Baltic Sea. However, compared to other areas of the Baltic Sea inhabited by longer-established populations, its population size is still relatively low.

T1  - First report of the mussel Mytella strigata (Hanley, 1843) in the Venezuelan Caribbean from an invasion in a shrimp farm
AN  - 2569692596
AB  - Individuals of mussels were collected in ponds from a commercial shrimp farm in the Unare region, Anzoátegui State, Venezuela. Identification was carried out using dichotomous keys and corroborated via analysis of similarities between the sequences of partial mitochondrial DNA of the cytochrome oxidase gene and Mytella strigata (Hanley, 1843) reported in GenBank with 99-100% similarity. Morphological analyses further supported the identification of the specimen. The first report of M. strigata in the Venezuelan Caribbean coast suggests that it could be a transplanted species. Possible negative effects of M. strigata on commercial shrimp production systems are discussed.

Além disso, confirmamos que o Alto Rio Uruguai está totalmente colonizado pelo mexilhâo-dourado, estando distribuido pelos ambientes lenticos, lóticos e de transiçâo existentes na regiâo. Esta atualizaçâo se mostra como uma importante ferramenta para a implementaçâo de diretrizes e o desenvolvimento de protocolos de segurança e barreiras sanitárias para evitar a dispersâo desta especie invasora em novos ambientes.Alternate abstract:Limnoperna fortunei is an invasive alien species (IAS) that cause serious ecological and economic problems in Brazilian freshwater environments. Due to its high dispersion capacity and the lack of new records in peer-reviewed journals we carried out an extensive survey to update the distribution of L. fortunei in the Brazilian hydrographic basins. We also performed a detailed investigation of its distribution in the Upper Uruguay River basin using a molecular method. We presented new records, showing the invasion in new basins and a wide distribution in the basins previously infested. Additionally, we confirmed that the Upper Uruguay River is fully colonized by the golden mussel, being distributed in the lentic, lotic, and transitional lotic/lentic environments presented in this region. This update is an important tool for the implementation of guidelines and the development of safety protocols and sanitary barriers to avoid the dispersion of this IAS to new environments..

T1  - Harmful algal blooms and environmentally friendly control strategies in Japan
AN  - 2550573625
AB  - The presence and status of harmful algal blooms (HABs) in Japan are reviewed, revealing a decrease in red tides; however, toxic blooms are found to be increasing in western Japan. Environmentally friendly control strategies against HABs are also compared with integrated agricultural pest management. Very high densities (105–108 CFU/g) of algicidal and growth-inhibiting bacteria were found in biofilm on seagrass and seaweed surfaces and in surrounding coastal seawater. The situation in freshwater ecosystems is similar to coastal seas for toxic cyanobacterium, Microcystis aeruginosa, and aquatic plants. These findings offer new insights into the ecology of influential bacteria and harmful algae, suggesting that protection and restoration of native seagrasses and seaweeds in coastal marine environments should be implemented to suppress HABs. Diatom blooms were successfully induced with bottom sediment perturbation to prevent the occurrence of harmful flagellates such as Chattonella spp. and Alexandrium catenella in the Seto Inland Sea; however, this method requires robust and reproducible verification. “Sato-Umi” is a helpful concept for HAB control in the sea and freshwater ecosystems when adequately managed by people (e.g., appropriate bottom perturbation; protection and restoration of seaweeds, seagrasses, and aquatic plants; application of polycultures of fish, seaweeds, etc.).

T1  - Calcium concentrations in the lower Columbia River, USA, are generally sufficient to support invasive bivalve spread: Research & Management
AN  - 2547329940
AB  - Dissolved calcium concentration [Ca2+] is thought to be a major factor limiting the establishment and thus the spread of invasive bivalves such as zebra (Dreissena polymorpha) and quagga (Dreissena bugensis) mussels. We measured [Ca2+] in 168 water samples collected along ~100 river‐km of the lower Columbia River, USA, between June 2018 and March 2020. We found [Ca2+] to range from 13 to 18 mg L−1 during summer/fall and 5 to 22 mg L−1 during the winter/spring. Previous research indicates that [Ca2+] < 12 mg L−1 are likely to limit the establishment and spread of invasive bivalves. Thus, our results indicate that there is sufficient Ca2+ in most locations in the lower Columbia River to support the establishment of invasive dreissenid mussels, which could join the already widespread and abundant Asian clam (Corbicula fluminea) as the newest invader to an already heavily invaded Columbia River ecosystem. These new data provide important measurements from a heretofore undersampled region of the Columbia River and have important implications for the spread of invasive bivalves and, by extension, the conservation and management of native species and ecosystems.

T1  - Major shortfalls impairing knowledge and conservation of freshwater molluscs
AN  - 2537863566
AB  - Molluscs are among the most diverse and widespread animal groups in freshwater habitats. Unfortunately, like most freshwater taxa, they are decreasing dramatically and are now among the most threatened animals on Earth, with many species already extinct or on the brink of extinction. Here, we review our current knowledge on the biodiversity and conservation of freshwater molluscs using the concept of knowledge shortfalls. We focus on seven previously proposed key shortfalls to review and analyse existing knowledge gaps relating to (1) taxonomy, the Linnean Shortfall; (2) distribution, the Wallacean Shortfall; (3) abundance and population dynamics, the Prestonian Shortfall: (4) evolution, the Darwinian Shortfall; (5) abiotic tolerances, the Hutchinsonian Shortfall; (6) traits, the Raunkiaeran Shortfall; and (7) biotic interactions, the Eltonian Shortfall. In addition, we address a new shortfall, which relates to the application and effectiveness of conservation measures, including assessments, methods, funding, and policies, the Ostromian Shortfall. Based on our review, we provide recommendations and suggest pathways to overcome these existing shortfalls. This work also introduces the articles in this special issue of Hydrobiologia, which represent key contributions to the First International Freshwater Mollusk Conservation Society Meeting held in Verbania, Italy, in 2018.

T1  - Sensitivity of <i>Pseudunio auricularius</i> to metals and ammonia: first evaluation
AN  - 2537863564
AB  - Populations of the critically endangered freshwater mussel Pseudunio auricularius (Spengler, 1793) have been suffering sharp declines, particularly in the Ebro basin (Iberian Peninsula). Among other factors, pollution could be responsible for these declines. We conducted, for the first time, acute toxicological tests (96 h) with heavy metals and ammonia on P. auricularius juveniles. The resulting LC50 values, in decreasing order of sensitivity, were: Cd = 38.85 µg/L, Cu = 58.64 µg/L, Ni = 124.60 µg/L, Zn = 267.40 µg/L, Cr(III) > 1000 µg/L, Pb > 2000 µg/L and total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) = 7.53 mg/L. We also report the estimated LC10, NOEC, LOEC and MATC values, which may be used to determine safer habitat conditions. Finally, we compare the obtained LC50 values with the concentrations of the toxicants in natural habitats where the species is present. Overall, the results reported here could be used to implement effective conservation actions, such as relocation of specimens to less-polluted sites or reduction of the concentration of pollutants in disturbed habitats. Considering the lack of ecotoxicological studies on freshwater mussels in Europe, this study may also be useful to establish toxicological reference limits for this imperiled faunal group.

T1  - Influence of surrounding land-use on mussel growth and glycogen levels in the St. Croix and Minnesota River Basins
AN  - 2537863307
AB  - Freshwater mussels face threats from climate change and changing land use that are dramatically altering their habitat. The health of mussel populations and the state of current and past environmental conditions can be monitored by measuring mussel growth and glycogen levels. In this study, we measured growth and glycogen levels in mussels from two small river basins impacted by different land uses. The Snake River in the St. Croix Basin, Minnesota, had low levels of suspended sediments and was surrounded mostly by forest and some developed land. The Chippewa, Cottonwood, and Le Sueur rivers in the Minnesota River Basin had significantly higher annual suspended sediment loads and highly agricultural basins. Mussel growth was highest in the Le Sueur and Cottonwood rivers followed by the Chippewa and the Snake rivers. Mussels in the Minnesota Basin rivers all had higher mussel foot glycogen concentrations than the Snake River. These patterns were similar for two mussel species, suggesting that environmental conditions are likely determining levels of growth. Although agriculture had a negative effect on mussel population abundance and diversity, it had a positive effect on growth and glycogen levels.

AB  - Conservation of the endangered freshwater pearl mussel (FPM) includes artificially rearing juveniles, but the pulsed flow-through (PFT) method, enabling the continuous renewal of water and food in culture containers, has not been applied to FPM. This study tested the PFT method in culture of FPM juveniles, and the effect of water source (tap vs well water) and food concentration (mixture of commercial phytoplankton products) on the survival and growth of juveniles. Beaker-specific survival rates varied from 0 to 100% (mean: 34%) and from 0 to 58% (mean: 16%) in the 1st (2-week) and 2nd (10-week) experiment, respectively. In the 1st experiment, juveniles attained statistically significantly bigger sizes and more than two times higher survival in well water than they did in tap water. In both experiments, the food concentration of 0.250 µl/l resulted in the highest survival (compared to other concentrations ranging from 0.125 to 0.500 µl/l). However, food concentration did not have a significant effect on size of juvenile FPM in either of the experiments. Results indicate that the PFT system is suitable for FPM rearing experiments, but its applicability to mass culture of FPM juveniles requires further investigation.

T1  - Zoogeography, ecology, and conservation status of the large freshwater mussels in Sweden
AN  - 2537863297
AB  - The Swedish fauna of native Unionids contains one Margaritiferidae species, six Unionidae species and four non-native species, one Unionidae, two Dreissenidae and one Mactridae. This is the first attempt to describe the Swedish freshwater mussel species in detail and put them in context with zoogeography, ecology, and conservation status. Detailed distribution maps for all species, based on all available material in museum collections, databases and literature are presented. Details in the distributions, and possible causes for the different geographical patterns exhibited, especially the so called limes norrlandicus—an important biogeographical transition zone in Central Sweden—are discussed. Information on the ecology, especially host fish species, and conservation status and projects are also given.

T1  - Patterns of growth, brooding and offspring size in the invasive mussel <i>Sinanodonta woodiana</i> (Lea, 1834) (Bivalvia: Unionidae) from an anthropogenic heat island
AN  - 2537862868
AB  - In freshwater temperate environments, waterbodies warmed by power plants can serve as a stepping stone in the spread of tropical and subtropical species. This offers a unique opportunity to acquire an insight into the life history of organisms undergoing range expansions beyond their native habitat. Here, we studied the patterns of offspring production and growth in the Asian mussel Sinanodonta woodiana inhabiting the thermal plume of the Odra River in Central Europe. Compared to the S. woodiana males, females had more convex shells and had a greater tendency to continue post-maturation growth and thus follow an indeterminate growth pattern. Gravid females were observed all-year round, and individuals with either large or more convex shells brooded more offspring. The proportion of incubating females, brood size and glochidia size were linked to gonadal activity and changed seasonally. Females with a higher amount of nutritive substances in the ovaries produced more and larger offspring. The smallest and the largest offspring occurred in the summer and in the winter, respectively. Sinanodonta woodiana incubated different offspring generations simultaneously, constantly releasing them into the environment. Using a life history evolution perspective, we discuss our results in view of allocation trade-offs between growth and offspring production.

T1  - Environmental DNA metabarcoding for freshwater bivalves biodiversity assessment: methods and results for the Western Palearctic (European sub-region)
AN  - 2537862495
AB  - Freshwater ecosystems are the most vulnerable worldwide and freshwater bivalves rank amongst the most threatened animals in the world. Surveying and monitoring freshwater bivalves are difficult tasks: they are difficult to find, hard to identify (taxonomic expertise is needed), and working underwater is technically challenging. It is therefore crucial to find more efficient methods to survey and monitor these species. Here, we present the first metabarcoding approach for freshwater bivalves and compare environmental DNA (eDNA) and traditional surveys. We describe two sets of primers (for Unionida and Venerida) developed for freshwater bivalves eDNA metabarcoding. These primers have been tested in the field, with about 300 studied sites. Results were compared to freshwater bivalves’ surveys using traditional methods, with eDNA always detecting more species than traditional surveys, especially when Sphaerids were taken into account. While our study initially focused on Western Palearctic freshwater bivalve species, our primers were confronted in silico with available sequences and have proven to be effective at a global scale. The results show that eDNA metabarcoding, with our developed primers, is a remarkable tool allowing for non-invasive surveys, detection of rare and inconspicuous species, absence data and overall freshwater bivalves routine monitoring.

T1  - Lipid bound phosphorus in the seston of Lake Erie and its tributaries and its use as an indicator of algal P-limitation
AN  - 2522236685
AB  - Concentrations of lipid-phosphorus (LP) in aquatic ecosystems can be influenced by algal biomass and the nutritional state of microbial communities, potentially serving a useful indicator of P-limitation. We examined the effectiveness of LP as a bioindicator by examining concentrations of LP and environmental factors controlling its abundance across Lake Erie and its tributaries. LP concentrations were correlated with chlorophyll a (Chl a) and total suspended solids, total P, and particulate carbon (PC), nitrogen, and P (PP) in both river and lake waters, while dissolved nutrients were only related to lake LP concentrations. Tributary LP was generally higher than in-lake values, and stoichiometric relationships between PC, PP, and LP indicated that Chl a was correlated with tributary LP. Chl a, bacterial production, and LP concentrations decreased significantly across nutrient gradients going from the west to east across the lake. Consistent relationships between lake particulate C:P ratios and Chl a: LP ratios were found across seasons, and higher values of both in August suggested algal P-limitation during this period. To further explore environmental controls on LP, we compared the relative influence of temperature, phytoplankton taxonomy, and water chemistry on lake LP concentrations. Though LP was correlated with well-known factors associated with cyanobacterial abundance in the lake (temperature and ammonium), particulate biomass and algal P-limitation seemed to be the most important correlates of LP concentration, suggesting that Chl a:LP ratios could provide a metric of P-limitation in aquatic ecosystems.

T1  - Microplastics in Invasive Freshwater Mussels (Dreissena sp.): Spatiotemporal Variation and Occurrence With Chemical Contaminants
AN  - 2546391368
AB  - Invasive zebra and quagga mussels (Dreissena spp.) in the Great Lakes of North America are biomonitors for chemical contaminants, but are also exposed to microplastics (< 5mm). Little research has examined in situ microplastic ingestion by dreissenid mussels, or the relationship between microplastics and chemical contaminants. We measured microplastics and chemical contaminants in mussel tissue from Milwaukee Harbor (Lake Michigan, USA) harvested from reference locations and sites influenced by wastewater effluent and urban river discharge. Mussels were deployed in cages in the summer of 2018, retrieved after 30 and 60 days, sorted by size class, and analyzed for microplastics and body burdens of three classes of contaminants: alkylphenols, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, and petroleum biomarkers. Microplastics in mussels were higher in the largest mussels at the wastewater-adjacent site after 30 days deployment. However, there was no distinction among sites for microplastics in smaller mussels, and no differences among sites after 60 days of deployment. Microplastics and chemical contaminants in mussels were not correlated. Microplastics have a diversity of intrinsic and extrinsic factors which influence their ingestion, retention, and egestion by mussels, and which vary relative to chemicals. While dreissenid mussels may not serve as plastic pollution biomonitors like they can for chemical contaminants, microplastics in dreissenid mussels are widespread, variable, and have unknown effects on physiology, mussel-mediated ecosystem processes, and lake food webs. These data will inform our understanding of the spatial distribution of microplastics in urban freshwaters, the role of dreissenid mussels in plastic budgets, and models for the fate of plastic pollution.

T1  - Heavy Metal, Rare Earth Element and Pb Isotope Dynamics in Mussels During a Depuration Experiment in the Gulf of Aqaba, Northern Red Sea
AN  - 2545781221
AB  - Mussels are considered highly efficient marine biomonitors, tracing anthropogenic and natural variations in heavy metals and various organic compounds. While heavy metals depuration processes in biomonitors are of growing interest, less knowledge is available regarding their Pb isotopes and rare earth elements (REEs) accumulation-release dynamics, and their response to short-term anthropogenic and terrigenous perturbations. Here, we report the results of a relocation experiment where a group of mussels (Brachidontes pharaonis) were extracted from a contaminated lagoon in the Gulf of Aqaba, northern Red Sea, and placed in water tables that were flushed continuously with fresh, uncontaminated seawater. Pairs of mussels were removed periodically from the water table over a period of 13 weeks and trace and rare earth elements and Pb isotopic compositions were determined separately for mussel shells and soft tissue. The results display a clear decrease over time in the concentrations of various heavy metals and REEs in the soft tissue, in concert with a similar shift in the Pb isotopic compositions towards seawater values. By contrast, the elemental and isotopic composition of the shell presents little change over time. Coupling between the Pb isotopic composition of corresponding soft tissue and shell samples allows back-calculation of the timing and magnitude of abrupt contamination events and provides quantitative constraints on long and short-term contamination events. Importantly however, considering the shallow coastal environment, the results may be biased by contributions of terrigenous material. Accordingly, Al-normalized element concentrations, Pb isotopes and the Ce anomalies, enabled the identification of two distinct terrigenous end members controlling the two sites. In summary, the study demonstrates the potential of using mussels as robust biomonitors of natural and anthropogenic environmental perturbations through the combination between elemental concentrations and the isotopic composition of Pb.

T1  - Paddlefish, Polyodon spathula: Historical, current status and future aquaculture prospects in Russia
AN  - 2623056180
AB  - In the wild, overfishing, habitat loss, industrial and agriculture activity has led to the degradation of freshwater habitats and, therefore, dramatically declines the Mississippi paddlefish (Polyodon spathula) stocks (Stone 2007). Paddlefish gain a growing commercial interest in the USSR/Russian Federation due to its ability to produce high-quality caviar. Also, it can be reared in polyculture ponds and a wide range of temperate reservoirs. Therefore, aquaculture of these valuable fish is necessary to meet consumer demand in Eastern European markets with flesh and caviar. Published information about the culture of paddlefish in the USSR/Russian Federation is scarce and not permanently available. Regarding our study, data were collected from English reports and translated Russian official statistics and studies. Also, FAO fisheries data from 1880 up to 2010 for paddleﬁsh were included. Moreover, caviar production data and prices were surveyed from companies. The collected data could briefly represent the historical and current status of paddlefish aquaculture and provide insight into the expected future production in the Russian Federation. Besides, it investigates the drawbacks of paddlefish aquaculture development and the potential challenges in Russian territories. Also, it discusses potential impacts related to the preservation of the breeding stocks, population naturalization and invasiveness of the species in the southern parts of Russia (i.e., in the Volga‐Caspian basin): Saratov, Rostov, Astrakhan Oblast and Krasnodar regions. Furthermore, this review aimed to gather the available data and the latest final findings that may address the welfare of paddlefish data to fill the knowledge gap towards improving the management of this species. In addition, future development prospects can be supported by government oversight through accurate accounting and financing for private farm activity.

T1  - Impact of temperature on chlorination strategies for mussel control at water treatment plants
AN  - 2548034768
AB  - Drinking water treatment plants in the Great Lakes often protect their intake structures against dreissenid biofouling by prechlorinating when water temperatures exceed 12 °C. This temperature threshold is based on the reproduction characteristics of zebra mussels. However, in recent years, zebra mussels have largely given way to quagga mussels in the region. These mussels reportedly reproduce at temperatures as low as 5 °C. The objective of this study was to determine if the current 12 °C trigger point for prechlorination remains appropriate. A 3-year monitoring program using bioboxes recorded mussel veliger concentrations and settlement potential in water drawn from the intakes of three drinking water treatment plants on Lake Ontario. Water temperature was a poor predictor of veliger presence and settlement. Reproduction and settlement were observed outside of the traditional temperature thresholds. Furthermore, no relationship was found between the number of veligers in the water column and those settling, suggesting that there are complex environmental factors that influence mussel activity. Nevertheless, it was observed that settlement occurred consistently between the months of July and November in the 3 years of the study. Therefore, a calendar-based approach to trigger prechlorination, as opposed to a temperature-based approach, is suggested.

T1  - DNA damage and biochemical responses in estuarine bivalve <i>Donax incarnatus</i> (Gmelin, 1791) exposed to sub-lethal concentrations of an organophosphate pesticide monocrotophos
AN  - 2521270952
AB  - Monocrotophos (MCP) is a highly toxic and broad-spectrum pesticide extensively used for agricultural and household purposes. The present study was aimed to evaluate the genotoxicity and alterations in the biochemical and physiological conditions induced by monocrotophos in a non-target organism, an estuarine bivalve, Donax incarnatus. The bivalves were exposed to three sub-lethal concentrations (6.8, 13.7, and 27.45 ppm) of MCP for a period of 72 h. DNA damage was assessed using the comet assay. Oxidative stress was analyzed using catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase. Neurotoxicity was evaluated using the acetylcholinesterase assay (AChE) and the physiological condition was assessed using the condition index (CI). A significant concentration-dependent increase of DNA damage was observed as well as a decline in the activities of the antioxidant enzymes. However, a decrease in DNA damage was observed with advancing time. A significant decrease of AChE activity and CI was observed in the bivalves exposed to MCP. Positive correlations were also observed between DNA damage and the antioxidant enzymes whereas negative correlations were observed between AChE and the antioxidant enzymes indicating MCP toxicity mediated by oxidative stress.

T1  - Associations Between Winter Temperatures and the Timing and Duration of Annual Larval Recruitment of a Non-native Anomuran Crab
AN  - 2516608652
AB  - The green porcelain crab, Petrolisthes armatus, a subtropical/tropical species, was first recorded on intertidal oyster reefs in South Carolina in 1995. Since then, its range has expanded north in a series of surges and setbacks that appear to be associated with particularly cold winters that may cause mortality. Petrolisthes armatus reproduces year-round in its native range whereas its reproductive season in the non-native range is limited to warmer months. Variation in the timing and duration of larval recruitment is not known for the non-native range and these factors may affect further range expansion. To determine whether P. armatus larval recruitment is related to temperature variation, in particular, the severity of winter temperatures, archival biweekly (every 2 weeks) larval samples collected 1994–2018 near its northern range limit in the North Inlet Winyah Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR) were examined. The goal was to determine whether the timing and duration of larval ingress varied over time and was related to temperature variation. Petrolisthes armatus larvae were first observed in samples collected in 1995. There was considerable interannual variability in the timing of the start of recruitment (coefficient of variation 29%), which ranged from the last week of March at the earliest to the last week of July at the latest, for all years but one. Earlier annual recruitment was positively correlated with a longer recruitment duration. The timing of first larval recruitment was also related to the severity of the preceding winter, with later larval recruitment occurring in years with several consecutive days of cold temperatures. Cold winter temperatures appear to affect overwintering populations and their ability to reproduce in the early spring. A decreasing frequency of severe winters along the coastal South Atlantic Bight may promote further poleward range expansion of P. armatus.

T1  - Ecophysiological responses of two closely related epigean and hypogean Niphargus species to hypoxia and increased temperature: Do they differ?
AN  - 2539313688
AB  - Ecological performance of animals depends on physiological and biochemical processes that are adjusted to the environment. The responses to hypoxia or anoxia have been frequently studied in subterranean aquatic organisms in order to find potential adaptations to restrict oxygen conditions occurring in the underground habitats. However, some previous studies have compared phylogenetic distant epigean and hypogean species or the epigean and hypogean populations of the same species due to little chance to compare closely related epigean and hypogean species. Therefore, in this study, we compared the effects of exposure to hypoxia, followed by reoxygenation, and increased temperature on oxygen consumption, potential metabolic activity, and antioxidant activities in closely related epigean and hypogean species: Niphargus zagrebensis and N. stygius. Oxygen consumption of N. stygius increased similarly during post-hypoxic recovery at 10 and 20°C (approx. 5-times), while N. zagrebensis increased its oxygen consumption for 9.7 and 4.4-times at 10 and 20°C, respectively. We observed higher exploitation of metabolic potential for current oxygen consumption during reoxygenation in N. zagrebensis than N. stygius. Exposure to hypoxia and subsequent reoxygenation at 20°C increased catalase (CAT) activity in N. stygius, but not in N. zagrebensis. We observed increased glutathione reductase activity in both Niphargus species. We concluded that respiratory and antioxidant responses to severe hypoxia and increased temperature differed between closely related epigean and hypogean Niphargus species. Hypogean Niphargus species possess physiological and biochemical characteristics that are advantageous in temperature stable subterranean environments which support inhabiting of species that have low energetic demands, while epigean Niphargus species can successfully inhabit specific surface habitats.

T1  - Rapid assessment of <i>Dreissena</i> population in Lake Erie using underwater videography
AN  - 2518858082
AB  - Dreissenid bivalves (Dreissena polymorpha and D. rostriformis bugensis) are considered the most aggressive freshwater invaders inflicting profound ecological and economic impacts on the waterbodies that they colonize. Severity of these impacts depends on dreissenid population sizes which vary dramatically across space and time. We developed a novel method that analyzes video recorded using a Benthic Imaging System (BIS) in near real-time to assess dreissenid distribution and density across large waterbodies and tested it on Lake Erie. Lake Erie basins differ dramatically in morphometry, turbidity, and productivity, as well as in Dreissena distribution, density, and length-frequency distribution, providing an excellent model to test the applicability of our method across large and dynamic environmental gradients. Results of rapid assessment were subsequently compared with dreissenid density obtained from Ponar grab samples collected at the same sites. In the eastern and central basins, the differences in basin-wide density estimations from BIS and Ponar were 3% and 23%, respectively. In the western basin, this method had limited application due to high turbidity and abundance of small (< 10 mm length) mussels. By substantially reducing the time required to assess dreissenids across large areas, rapid assessment could be a useful and cost-effective addition for monitoring their populations.

T1  - Traits and impacts of introduced species: a quantitative review of meta-analyses
AN  - 2518854923
AB  - Despite significant growth in the information on introduced species (NIS), agreement on their comparative fitness and effects on native (NAT) communities is heterogeneous. Hypotheses aimed at explaining their fitness and impacts are as often supported as challenged. In order to investigate whether origin is associated with fitness or impact, we reviewed 72 meta-analyses of trait differences between NAT and NIS, and impacts of NIS on NAT and the environment, covering terrestrial and aquatic organisms. Interpretation of the trends was based on overall meta-analysis conclusions, and on numbers of point estimates (individual effect sizes) within and across studies. Mixed results were found in 44% of the studies. Higher NIS fitness and significant impacts were found in 31%, and 25% concluded that significant outcomes are largely absent. Point estimates showed that non-significant outcomes (57%) are more common than significant ones. Two thirds yield mixed trait differences and impacts, or do not support the concept that NIS are more fit or have negative effects on NAT. When trait differences or impacts are significant, NAT are usually less fit, or are negatively impacted, but this trend is influenced by the fact that most surveys are based on the most damaging invasive species.

T1  - Hydrological connectivity drives the propagule pressure of <i>Limnoperna fortunei</i> (Dunker, 1857) in a tropical river–floodplain system
AN  - 2518854910
AB  - River–floodplain systems are characterized by high connectivity, which favours the spread of non-native species. In floodplain, floods increase connectivity, which increases the similarity of abiotic conditions among environments. High connectivity and low environmental variability may favour the establishment of non-native species such as Limnoperna fortunei, but this has not yet been tested. We sampled L. fortunei larvae in nine connected lakes and nine isolated lakes to rivers in the upper Paraná River floodplain to evaluate how spatial (connection) and abiotic (environmental variability) factors affect the larvae density of L. fortunei. We considered the rivers as propagule source of L. fortunei because this invasive species has successfully established in rivers, but not in lakes. Our findings revealed that connected lakes had a high larval density of L. fortunei, while isolated lakes had a low density. Isolated lakes presented a high multi-environmental variability, which was strong negatively related with the larval density of L. fortunei. However, the connectivity decreased the multi-environmental variability, indirectly increasing the larval density of L. fortunei. Our study illustrates that permanent connectivity with invaded environments increase the larvae density of L. fortunei in non-invaded environments, which occurs both directly (through propagule dispersion) and indirectly (by decreasing multi-environmental variability).

AB  - This study aimed to address the Ophiothela species distribution worldwide, report invasive populations, and investigate their association with benthic organisms through an extensive review of the scientific literature. All six Ophiothela species occur between latitudes 33º S and 38º N and, together, are dispersed across 75% of the marine realms. Spread throughout more than 6700 km of the Western Atlantic Ocean coastline, O. mirabilis is the only species recorded as invasive. Higher plasticity in substrate use was detected in invaded areas than in native ones, which indicates that substrate availability does not limit the invasive potential of O. mirabilis. The colonization affinity of Ophiothela species is high for Cnidaria species, irrespective of population origin. High densities (e.g., up to 2.8 brittle stars cm−2 per gorgonian surface) and opportunistic habitat colonization pattern found for O. mirabilis invasive populations suggest fast dispersion rates along the Atlantic coast. Therefore, the expansion of this species to nearby systems is likely, and the potential to damage native host species is high.

T1  - Aquatic invasive species: introduction to the Special Issue and dynamics of public interest
AN  - 2518854850
AB  - Aquatic invasive species research has been surging in popularity, with the number of papers published in Hydrobiologia doubling since the previous decade. We overview contributions to the current Special Issue, including new studies on introduction and establishment, traits distinguishing high-impact invaders and their impacts, interactions between AIS and other human stressors as well as new developments in management. In addition, we analyze public interest in invasive species using 17 years of data (2004–2020) on absolute search volumes from Google extracted using Keywords Everywhere app. In particular, we analyze trends in searches for invasive species in general, several high-impact AIS, as well as the popularity of invasive species searches contrasted with other commonly recognized ecological problems in aquatic ecosystems. During the available search period, search volume for invasive species in general has increased and compared favorably with other ecological issues, whereas search volume patterns for high-impact AIS were species-specific and often exceeded search volumes for the general keyword. Public engagement is critical for all aspects of AIS research and management, and analysis of search volumes can be used to gauge, sustain and diversify this engagement.

T1  - The drifting dinoflagellate <i>Ceratium furcoides</i> (Levander) Langhans 1925: fundamental niche shift during global invasion
AN  - 2518854767
AB  - Ceratium furcoides is a freshwater dinoflagellate originally from cold waters of northern Europe that has been expanding its distribution into new areas worldwide. Species distribution modeling (SDM) based on maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt) showed that C. furcoides has a much wider potential range than its current distribution and isothermality as the key environmental variable determining its spatial pattern. The model successfully predicts areas of introduction and the climate matching approach has identified mainly tropical and some subtropical regions as most vulnerable areas at risk of introduction and establishment of C. furcoides. Furthermore, the observed shift of the climatic niche occurred between native and non-native ranges, providing, for the first time, a robust evidence that a dinoflagellate can occupy climatically distinct niche spaces following its introduction into new areas. This is probably mirroring the lack of adequate management to deal with various impacts on drainage basins, such as ongoing accelerated cultural eutrophication coupled with river impoundments and water diversion. Thus, this framework provides helpful insights on how to optimize our ability to anticipate invasions and to avoid ecosystem services losses, as well as future studies prospects on adaptive mechanisms of this pervasive invader.

T1  - Fish vs. Aliens: predatory fish regulate populations of <i>Limnoperna fortunei</i> mitigating impacts on native macroinvertebrate communities
AN  - 2518854747
AB  - Limnoperna fortunei, an invasive mussel altering the structure of benthic communities, is preyed upon by several fish species in South America. To investigate the impact of predatory fish on populations of this mussel, and the effects of this top-down interaction on native macroinvertebrates, we performed an in situ experiment in the Uruguay River. By comparing benthic communities of artificial substrates colonised in treatments allowing or excluding fish access, it was demonstrated that fish significantly reduce colonisation by L. fortunei (i.e. its density, biomass and body size). In the absence of mussels (before settlement), fish preyed upon the native macroinvertebrate community inhabiting artificial substrates, reducing their densities compared to the fish exclusion treatment. However, it was found that in the presence of golden mussel (after settlement), the total density of benthic macroinvertebrates, densities of scrapers, and densities of dipterans and gastropods strongly decreased in fish exclusion treatments, suggesting a strong effect of L. fortunei in reducing the native fauna. By preying on L. fortunei, fish favoured the persistence of native macroinvertebrates. Further studies focused on predatory fish species and their efficiency in removing L. fortunei may contribute to advancing towards using native fish as mitigating agents.

T1  - Maintenance management and eradication of established aquatic invaders
AN  - 2518854703
AB  - Although freshwater invasions have not been targeted for maintenance management or eradication as often as terrestrial invasions have, attempts to do so are frequent. Failures as well as successes abound, but several methods have been improved and new approaches are on the horizon. Many freshwater fish and plant invaders have been eliminated, especially by chemical and physical methods for fishes and herbicides for plants. Efforts to maintain invasive freshwater fishes at low levels have sometimes succeeded, although continuing the effort has proven challenging. By contrast, successful maintenance management of invasive freshwater plants is uncommon, although populations of several species have been managed by biological control. Invasive crayfish populations have rarely been controlled for long. Marine invasions have proven far less tractable than those in fresh water, with a few striking eradications of species detected before they had spread widely, and no marine invasions have been substantially managed for long at low levels. The rapid development of technologies based on genetics has engendered excitement about possibly eradicating or controlling terrestrial invaders, and such technologies may also prove useful for certain aquatic invaders. Methods of particular interest, alone or in various combinations, are gene-silencing, RNA-guided gene drives, and the use of transgenes.

T1  - Life history variation in space and time: environmental and seasonal responses of a parthenogenetic invasive freshwater snail in northern Germany
AN  - 2518854678
AB  - The processes that lead to a successful invasion are complex. Here, we investigated life history characteristics potentially explaining the invasion success of Potamopyrgus antipodarum, a small parthenogenetic and ovoviviparous freshwater snail that was recently added to the top “hundred worst” alien species in Europe. We monitored monthly, over the course of 1 year, shell size, number of brooded embryos, and the presence of castrating parasites at three Northeast German sites: a lake (the Kiessee), a stream (Hohen Sprenz), and a small spring brook (Rügen) (N = 1165). We found that (1) despite sharing the same clonal lineage, drastic differences in space and time for size and fecundity were observed, and these differences were linked to specific environmental variables (water temperature, salinity, and current); (2) P. antipodarum reproduces all year around, except at one of our sites, the spring Rügen, where the reproduction was seasonal; (3) none of our dissected specimens was infected by parasites. Together with ovoviviparity and the ability to reproduce parthenogenetically while being released from parasite pressure, the ability to adapt readily to a wide range of habitat conditions is likely paramount for the invasive success of P. antipodarum.

T1  - Invasive potential of golden and zebra mussels in present and future climatic scenarios in the new world
AN  - 2518854677
AB  - Biological invasions and climate change are important drivers of biodiversity loss. In freshwater ecosystems, golden and zebra mussels are two highly aggressive invasive species that have caused ecological and economic damages in South and North America, respectively. Here, we used ecological niche models (ENMs) to investigate the invasive potential of golden and zebra mussels in present and future scenarios of global warming in the New World. We found two main patterns in the distribution of suitable areas for golden and zebra mussels. First, the distribution of potentially suitable areas, both in present and future scenarios, is different between mussel species: zebra mussel has areas that are more suitable in temperate regions, while suitable areas for golden mussel are concentrated in tropical and subtropical regions. Second, suitable habitats for golden mussel will increase more in future global warming scenarios compared to suitable habitats for zebra mussel. Indeed, there are experimental indications that zebra mussel has a lower tolerance to high temperatures compared to golden mussel, which is in agreement with our findings. We recommend that the future monitoring of both golden and zebra mussels in the New World should consider areas of highest thermic suitability for current and future scenarios.

T1  - Towards global dominance of invasive alien plants in freshwater ecosystems: the dawn of the Exocene?
AN  - 2518854615
AB  - The global and seemingly unstoppable spread of invasive alien plants emerges as one of the main topics of current science. This is due to the multiple repercussions of invasive plants on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, plus huge consequences on human existence. In freshwaters, lots of invaders are extremely competitive by virtue of their idiosyncratic reproductive and adaptive strategies. As “inland islands”, freshwaters seem particularly prone to changes when invaded, such as reorganisation of food webs and biotic interactions. Together, these events are self-reinforcing, implying hardly reversible hysteric phenomena. The intention of this paper is to point out: invasion pathways, driving factors, invasion mechanisms, and noticeable effects mediated by plant invaders in freshwaters through an extensive knowledge review. The growing evidence suggests the dawn of a new epochal phase: a globally alien-dominated “bio-historical horizon”, tentatively called “Exocene”, where invaders play predominant roles that drive freshwaters functioning and successional unexpected stages. In the context of invasion science, Exocene reinforces the need for an ecosystem-based perspective to properly understand the implications of plant invaders in freshwaters. Seven challenging issues emerge to be addressed to better outline the global paths of biodiversity and functioning between biomes when faced with biological invasion.

T1  - Quantitative food web structure and ecosystem functions in a warm-temperate seagrass bed
AN  - 2517673765
AB  - Seagrass beds are important habitats in coastal areas but increasingly decline in area and quality, thus conservation measures are urgently needed. Quantitative food webs, describing the biomass distribution and energy fluxes among trophic groups, reveal structural and functional aspects of ecosystems. Their knowledge can improve ecological conservation. For the recently discovered large warm-temperate seagrass (Zostera japonica) habitat in China’s Yellow River Delta wetland, we used δ13C and δ15N measurements and a Bayesian isotope mixing model to construct its food web diagram with quantitative estimations of consumer diet compositions, comprising detritus and 14 living trophic groups from primary producers to fish. We then estimated the quantitative food web fluxes based on biomass measurements and calculated corresponding ecosystem functions. Pelagic producers were significantly 13C-depleted compared to benthic sources. Consumers (except zooplankton) were increasingly 13C-depleted with increasing trophic positions even though the consumed benthic production surpassed the pelagic one. Bivalves dominated consumer biomasses and fluxes and were the first to connect the pelagic and benthic pathways, whereas zooplankton and gastropods were specialized on the two pathways, respectively. We found flat biomass and production pyramids indicating low trophic transfer efficiencies. Generally, the energetic structure of the quantitative food web was consistent with the stable isotope analysis, and the estimated net primary production and most estimated production to biomass ratios of the trophic groups fell within literature ranges. This study provides a systematical understanding of the quantitative trophic ecology of a seagrass bed and facilitates synergistic knowledge on management, conservation, and restoration.

T1  - Influence of Environmental Stressors on the Microbiota of Zebra Mussels (<i>Dreissena polymorpha</i>)
AN  - 2516608748
AB  - Host-associated microbiota play a critical role in host fitness by providing nutrition, enhancing digestion capabilities, and by providing protection from pathogens. Here, we investigated the effects of two environmental stressors, temperature, and salinity, on the microbiota associated with zebra mussels (ZMs), a highly invasive bivalve in North America. To examine this in detail, lake-collected ZMs were acclimated to laboratory conditions, and subjected to temperature and salinity stress conditions. The impact of these stressors on the diversity, composition, and dynamics of ZM-associated microbiota were assessed by using amplicon- and shotgun-based sequencing, and qPCR-based approaches. Elevated temperature was found to be the primary driver of ZM mortality, although salinity alone also increased its likelihood. Stressor-induced ZM mortality, which ranged between 53 and 100%, was concomitant with significant increases in the relative abundance of several genera of putative opportunistic pathogens including Aeromonas. These genera were only present in low relative abundance in ZMs obtained from the control tank with 0% mortality. Shotgun sequencing and qPCR analyses indicated that the relative and absolute abundances of pathogenic Aeromonas species (particularly A. veronii) were significantly greater in temperature-induced dead ZMs. Taken together, our results show that environmental stress, especially elevated temperature (> 25 °C), is associated with the rapid mortality of ZMs as well as the proliferation of putative opportunistic bacterial pathogens.

T1  - Methodology for flushing pressurised irrigation networks for fertigation and operation maintenance purposes
AN  - 2513720928
AB  - Pressurised irrigation networks with a certain degree of automation allow centralized fertigation and maintenance operations such as cleaning subunits and preventing the proliferation of invasive species such as zebra mussels. Until now, there is no methodology that guarantees the total cleaning of the network of a substance in the shortest possible time. In the same way, it does not exist to guarantee reaching all consumption points with a certain concentration of a substance, injecting the minimum possible amount. For that purpose, a general novel methodology has been developed that makes use of the network’s hydraulic model and parallel multi-objective genetic algorithms to flush the network of a certain substance or to get it to all consumption points in the shortest possible time and supplying a minimum volume. This method assumes that the available pressure at the source is always over a minimum value. The arrival times to the consumption points are minimized and the injected volume is reduced to the minimum of replacement, that is, the volume of the network pipes. The methodology applied to the study case allowed the entire network to be flushed in a minimum time of 2.46 h. On a normal irrigation day, without making any changes to the irrigation schedule the time to completely flush the network is 11.76 h. Furthermore, the injected volume differs greatly from the total volume of the pipes.

T1  - Identifying the influence of zebra and quagga mussels on sedimentary phosphorus dynamics in western Lake Erie
AN  - 2509905477
AB  - Dreissenid mussels can alter nutrient cycling and algal productivity in many freshwater ecosystems. But their effects on sedimentary phosphorus dynamics remain largely undefined. Here, we report evidence that dreissenids affect the concentrations of five sedimentary phosphorus fractions and total phosphorus. During our study, zebra mussels were still common and coexisted with quagga mussels in many parts of the basin. The relative abundances varied across the basin, which we characterized as five west-to-east alternating zones where zebra mussels dominated zones I (coastal) and III, quagga mussels dominated zones II and IV, and few dreissenids were present in zone V. The phosphorus fractions exhibited variation concordant with and therefore potentially influenced by dreissenids. Concentrations of all fractions and TP were consistently greater in sediments where quagga mussels dominated than in sediments where zebra mussels dominated. The responses to the absence versus presence of dreissenids were mixed, with Res-P being significantly affected, NaCl-Pi and HCl-Pi being moderately affected, and NaOH-Pi being least affected. Although such dreissenid effects were somewhat altered by in-lake biogeochemical cycling and transfer, we found that elevated levels of NaCl-Pi in dreissenid-present sediments, especially in quagga-dominated sediments, could be linked to recent eutrophication and harmful algal blooms in the basin.

T1  - Determination of illicit drugs and psychoactive pharmaceuticals in wastewater from the area of Thessaloniki (Greece) using LC–MS/MS: estimation of drug consumption
AN  - 2509428347
AB  - This study presents the development of an analytical method for the simultaneous determination of multiclass illicit drugs (cocainoids, opiates, amphetamines, and cannabinoids) and psychoactive pharmaceuticals (anxiolytics, hypnotics, antipsychotics, antidepressants, and antiparkinsonian), in municipal wastewater. The analytical method was validated in terms of specificity, linearity, precision, and accuracy. The recoveries (%) for the majority of the analytes ranged between 70 and 120%, while the method showed good repeatability (2.4–29.2%). The limits of detection (LOD) of the method ranged between 0.8 and 9.4 ng L−1. The method was implemented on influent and effluent samples from Thessaloniki (N. Greece) wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), and it revealed the daily presence of benzoylecgonine (BEG) (84.0–202.2 ng L−1), methadone (12.3–17.5 ng L−1), 11-Nor-9-carboxy-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-COOH) (80.3–171.9 ng L−1), morphine (144.2–264.3 ng L−1), and 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM) (5.8–12.0 ng L−1) in the influent samples of WWTP. Clozapine (101.6–315.5 ng L−1), quetiapine (33.5–109.7 ng L−1), and fluoxetine (20.9–124.4 ng L−1) were pharmaceutical psychotics with the highest concentration in the influents. Back calculation estimated that the daily consumption of cocaine, heroin, cannabis, and methadone was 36–95, 86–164, 2300–5400, and 8–12 mg day−1 per 1000 inhabitants, respectively. The consumption was estimated between 7–16 and 15 mg day−1 per 1000 inhabitants for methyl diethanolamine (MDEA) and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), respectively.

T1  - Tidal Freshwater Zones as Hotspots for Biogeochemical Cycling: Sediment Organic Matter Decomposition in the Lower Reaches of Two South Texas Rivers
AN  - 2503048939
AB  - While organic and inorganic nutrient inputs from land are recognized as a major driver of primary production in estuaries, remarkably little is known about how processes within the tidal freshwater zones (TFZs) of rivers modify these inputs. This study quantifies organic matter (OM) decomposition rates in surface sediment layers in the lower reaches of two south Texas river channels and identifies key parameters that influence sediment decomposition rates. Sediment cores were collected from non-tidal and tidal freshwater sites in the Mission and Aransas rivers during two summers (June 2015 and June 2016) and two winters (February 2016, January 2017). We measured oxygen consumption rates, organic carbon and nitrogen content, stable isotope ratios (δ13C and δ15N of OM), and sediment porosity. O2 consumption rates in TFZ sediments were 385 ± 88 μmol O2 m−2 h−1 (summer) and 349 ± 87 μmol O2 m−2 h−1 (winter) in the Aransas River and 767 ± 153 μmol O2 m−2 h−1 (summer) and 691 ± 95 μmol O2 m−2 h−1 (winter) in the Mission River. These rates in TFZs were similar to rates in estuaries and higher than rates at non-tidal riverine sites. Rates of sediment O2 consumption were primarily controlled by OM content and temperature. Sediment OM was dominated by algal biomass from in situ production in both TFZs. We hypothesize that algal production and sinking within TFZs is a major pathway for translocation of watershed-derived nutrients from the water column to the sediments within TFZs. Further work is needed to quantify linkages between decomposition, nutrient remineralization, and potential removal through processes such as denitrification.

T1  - Ribbed Mussels Continue to Feed and Biodeposit in the Presence of Injured Conspecifics and Predators
AN  - 2503048452
AB  - Species interactions may mediate the ability of organisms and communities to provide valued services but are rarely considered in forecasting how service provisioning will change as restored communities mature and change in species composition. Bivalves are foundational species in many communities that contribute to services such as habitat provisioning, water filtration, and denitrification but that also may respond to predator presence by reducing activity. Filtering and biodeposition rates of ribbed mussels (Geukensia demissa) in the presence of predators (blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus), oyster drills (Urosalpinx cinerea)), injured conspecifics, or other local species (mud snails, Tritia obsoleta) were compared in laboratory experiments conducted in July–August 2019 in the Hudson River estuary (New York, USA). The effect of predator diet on ribbed mussel responses was also considered. Although mussels tended to be less active in the presence of predators and injured conspecifics, significant decreases were observed in few traits, and there was no evidence that predator diet influenced mussel responses. Variability in feeding rates and other factors such as water quality may play a larger role than predator presence in determining mussel activity. These results suggest that G. demissa will continue to provide positive impacts on water clarity and quality and increase denitrification rates via biodeposition even as restored communities attract predators.

T1  - Variable Oxygen Levels Lead to Variable Stoichiometry of Benthic Nutrient Fluxes in a Hypertrophic Estuary
AN  - 2503047780
AB  - Harmful blooms of cyanobacteria may extend over long time spans due to self-sustaining mechanisms. We hypothesized that settled blooms may increase redox-dependent P release and unbalance the stoichiometry of benthic nutrient regeneration (NH4+:SiO2:PO43− ratios). We tested this hypothesis in the hypertrophic Curonian Lagoon, the largest in Europe. During summer, at peak chlorophyll and water temperatures, sediment cores were collected over 19 stations representing all the lagoon sedimentary environments. Sediment organic content, granulometry, aerobic respiration, and oxic and anoxic fluxes of dissolved inorganic nutrients and metals—Fe2+ and Mn2+—were measured. Loads and stoichiometry of regenerated nutrients were compared with those from the watershed. Analyzed sediments had elevated oxygen demand (−1.90 to −5.66 mmol O2 m−2 h−1), generally uncoupled to their variable organic matter content (1–23%) and median particle size (30–300 μm). Under oxic conditions, summer internal recycling equaled (SiO2) or exceeded, by a factor of ~66 and ~ 2, external loads of NH4+ and PO43−, respectively. Transient anoxia produced a general decrease of NH4+ and SiO2 regeneration, likely due to decreased macrofauna activity or inefficient mineralization, whereas it doubled average PO43− fluxes. In sandy, well-flushed areas, anoxia had a minor effect on PO43−, but stimulated a large production of Mn2+. Muddy sediments in lagoon areas with slow water renewal displayed large redox-dependent PO43− mobility, coupled to Fe2+ release. Settled algal blooms and hypoxic conditions might unbalance benthic regeneration stoichiometry and sustain blooms. The sedimentary pool of Mn4+ may represent a natural buffer preventing iron reduction and PO43− mobility.

T1  - Forensics Meets Ecology – Environmental DNA Offers New Capabilities for Marine Ecosystem and Fisheries Research
AN  - 2518852257
AB  - Climatic changes and anthropogenic pressures affect biodiversity and community composition. These biodiversity shifts are recognized in marine ecosystems, but the underlying processes are barely understood so far. Importantly, human well-being highly relies on oceanic services, which are affected by anthropogenic pressures. Here, we review how interdisciplinary research approaches, with the incorporation of eDNA (environmental DNA) analyses, can help increase the understanding of complex ecosystem processes and dynamics, and how they affect ecosystem services. We discuss marine conservation issues in the light of life cycle aspects and conclude that eDNA can improve our ecological knowledge in some instances, for example, in tracking migration patterns. We also illustrate and discuss the application of eDNA analysis within the context of population genetics, epigenetics, geochemistry and oceanography. Embedded into an interdisciplinary context, eDNA can be exploited by a huge variety of methodological techniques, and can resolve spatio-temporal patterns of diversity, species, or even populations within ecological, evolutionary, and management frameworks.

T1  - The experimental range extension of guppies (<i>Poecilia reticulata</i>) influences the metabolic activity of tropical streams
AN  - 2513420479
AB  - The ecological consequences of biological range extensions reflect the interplay between the functional characteristics of the newly arrived species and their recipient ecosystems. Teasing apart the relative contribution of each component is difficult because most colonization events are studied retrospectively, i.e., after a species became established and its consequences apparent. We conducted a prospective experiment to study the ecosystem consequences of a consumer introduction, using whole-stream metabolism as our integrator of ecosystem activity. In four Trinidadian streams, we extended the range of a native fish, the guppy (Poecilia reticulata), by introducing it over barrier waterfalls that historically excluded it from these upper reaches. To assess the context dependence of these range extensions, we thinned the riparian forest canopy on two of these streams to increase benthic algal biomass and productivity. Guppy’s range extension into upper stream reaches significantly impacted stream metabolism but the effects depended upon the specific stream into which they had been introduced. Generally, increases in guppy biomass caused an increase in gross primary production (GPP) and community respiration (CR). The effects guppies had on GPP were similar to those induced by increased light level and were larger in strength than the effects stream stage had on CR. These results, combined with results from prior experiments, contribute to our growing understanding of how consumers impact stream ecosystem function when they expand their range into novel habitats. Further study will reveal whether local adaptation, known to occur rapidly in these guppy populations, modifies the ecological consequences of this species introduction.

T1  - Hydrodynamic interactions with coral topography and its impact on larval settlement
AN  - 2508023889
AB  - Many benthic larvae rely on ambient flow and turbulence for their dispersal to settlement sites. After reaching the seafloor, larvae must prevent predation as well as overcome flow forces which act to dislodge them in order to achieve successful settlement. Most oceanic benthic habitats are topographically complex and are characterized by a combination of tidally driven currents and wave-driven oscillatory flows, which can exert substantial forces along settlement surfaces. In this study, computational fluid dynamics was used to numerically model both wave-dominated and unidirectional flows over surfaces of varying topography designed to mimic the surface roughness of corals. Near-surface hydrodynamic parameters, including velocities, turbulence statistics, and surface shear stresses, were computed, along with forces on simulated larvae settled on surfaces. It was found that widely spaced surface roughness (characterized as a k-type roughness with roughness width/height > 1) yielded 50–100% higher surface shear stress than tightly spaced roughness (characterized as d-type with width/height < 1), owing to eddy vortex ejection from k-type topographies. Results also found that a larva experiences up to two orders of magnitude greater mean fluid forces when settled on top of a roughness element rather than between roughness elements. Maximum drag and lift forces on a larva were two to three times greater in wave conditions compared to unidirectional flows. Our findings demonstrate that larvae have a higher probability to remain attached to surfaces when in less wavy environments and sheltered within coral crevices of d-type roughness.

T1  - Different effects of Zn nanoparticles and ions on growth and cellular respiration in the earthworm <i>Eisenia andrei</i> after long-term exposure
AN  - 2504164084
AB  - In this study, the effects of zinc nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) and ions (ZnCl2) on the mortality, growth, maturation, and cellular respiration of the earthworm Eisenia andrei were assessed. Earthworms were individually exposed for 98 days, starting from the juvenile stage, to soils contaminated with either ZnO-NPs or ZnCl2 (125, 250, 500 and 1000 mg Zn kg−1 dry weight (dw)). Exposure to the highest-concentration ionic treatments (500 and 1000 mg kg−1) caused 100% mortality, while for other treatments, mortality did not exceed 15% at the end of exposure. Compared to the control treatment, both 125–1000 mg kg−1 ZnO-NPs and 125 or 250 mg kg−1 ZnCl2 stimulated earthworm growth, which might be due to a hormetic effect. ZnO-NPs and ZnCl2 caused different responses at medium Zn concentrations (250 and 500 mg kg−1): earthworms exposed to ionic treatment at 250 mg kg−1 were characterized by a significantly lower growth constant, lower cellular respiration rate, later inflection point, and higher final body weight than those exposed to ZnO-NPs treatments at the same (250 mg kg−1) or twice as high (500 mg kg−1) nominal Zn concentrations. However, differences were not observed in all examined parameters between the studied forms when the highest-concentration ZnO-NPs treatment was compared with the lowest-concentration ionic treatment, which was likely due to the same levels of available Zn concentrations in those treatments. Overall, different growth and maturation strategies accompanied by pronounced differences in cellular respiration were adopted by earthworms exposed to low and medium levels of either ZnO-NPs or ZnCl2.

T1  - Highlighting the promise of qPCR-based environmental monitoring: response of the ribosomal RNA:DNA ratio of calanoid copepods to toxic cyanobacteria
AN  - 2504161332
AB  - Calanoid copepods are integral to aquatic food webs and may drive the bioaccumulation of toxins and heavy metals, spread of infectious diseases, and occurrence of toxic cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (HABs) in freshwater aquatic systems. However, interrelationships between copepod and cyanobacterial population dynamics and ecophysiology remain unclear. Insights into these relationships are important to aquatic resource management, as they may help guide mitigation efforts. We developed a calanoid copepod qPCR assay to investigate how copepod abundance and physiological status relate to the abundance of cyanobacteria and the concentration of total microcystin in a HAB-prone freshwater multi-use eutrophic lake. Through in silico and in vitro validation of primers and analyses of time series, we demonstrate that our assay can be used as a reliable tool for environmental monitoring. Importantly, copepod RNA:DNA ratios on and shortly after the day when microcystin concentration was at its highest within the lake were not significantly lower (or higher) than before or after this period, suggesting that copepods may have been tolerant of microcystin levels observed and capable of perpetuating bloom events by consuming competitors of toxic cyanobacteria.

T1  - Biological feedback of unprecedented hydromorphological side channel restoration along the Upper Rhine (France)
AN  - 2503529365
AB  - In Europe, large rivers have been greatly impacted by engineering and hydraulic works. The Upper Rhine channelization has notably led to a disconnection between the main channel and its floodplain and side channels. Between 1998 and 2006, unprecedented restoration projects led to the reconnection of nine Rhine side channels to the main channel or the Rhine Drainage Canal. The structures of recolonizing macroinvertebrate communities observed in the restored side channels, either in 2009 or 2010, were compared to the ones of three reference side channels. The aims of the study were (i) to analyze the recolonizing macroinvertebrate communities and (ii) to identify the drivers of the community structure. The restored side channels exhibited macroinvertebrate community structures similar to those of the reference side channels. These communities were characterized by a high abundance of nonnative and invasive taxa and a structure not linked to either the time since restoration or the water and sediment chemistry. Significant correlations existed between the macroinvertebrate community structures and the mosaics of habitats, driven by the variations in side channel morphometry and discharge. Therefore, the diversity of habitat characteristics of the side channels might help conserve and increase macroinvertebrate biodiversity at the floodplain scale.

T1  - Response of green mussels (<i>Perna viridis</i>) subjected to chlorination: investigations by valve movement monitoring
AN  - 2503198430
AB  - Perna viridis Linnaeus (1758) is a major foulant in the cooling water systems of electric power stations located on the East coast of India. Though chlorination is considered an effective fouling control measure, the strategy may fail in the case of bivalve mussels, due to the ability of the mussels to close their shells and still survive for extended periods of time. In a given power station, continuous low dose (exomotive) chlorination (0.2 ± 0.1 mg l−1) is practiced to control biofouling. Laboratory experiments were carried out to assess the mortality and valve movement response of Perna viridis exposed to chlorine, using a Mosselmonitor®. All size groups tested showed progressive reduction in valve opening upon chlorination. However, continuous dosing of chlorine concentration as high as 1.0 mg l−1 was required for sustained and complete valve closure response in this mussel. At lower concentration (0.7 mg l−1), the mussels were able to open their shells and feed. Sustained valve closure resulted in physiological stress to the mussels due to reduced feeding, subsequently leading to death. Time to 100% mortality was dependent on the size of the mussels. At 1.0 mg l−1 chlorine residual, smaller size group (30–50 mm) mussels showed 100% mortality in 79.3 h, while larger groups (50–70 mm and 70–90 mm) took 152 h and 243 h, respectively. Frequency of valve opening was high in smaller size group mussels (30–50 mm), compared with larger groups (70–90 mm). Even though the time taken for killing was size-dependent, frequency of valve opening and time period between successive openings were found to be characteristic of individual mussels. The observations provide new insight into the response of bivalve mussels to continuous chlorination in the context of biofouling control and point to the need to adopt pragmatic strategies to prevent mussel spat settlement rather than killing of adult mussels, thereby reducing environmental burden due to chlorine residuals. Usage of target-specific biocidal strategies (intermittent/pulse dosing) or alternative biocides (chlorine dioxide) may help mitigate green mussel fouling in tropical cooling water systems.

T1  - Microbial characterization of a natural biofilm associated with Peruvian scallop (Argopecten purpuratus) larvae settlement on artificial collector by confocal imaging, microbiology, and metagenomic analysis
AN  - 2509034584
AB  - Biofilms strongly influence bivalve settlement patterns on artificial substrates; however, their structure and taxonomic composition remains a black box. We characterized a natural biofilm composition that exhibits a large settlement of larvae of the Peruvian scallop Argopecten purpuratus by culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. Thirty-two different strains, representing six genera (10 strains of Bacillus, 9 of Vibrio, 6 Acinetobacter, 4 Staphylococcus, 2 Photobacterium, and 1 Exiguobacterium) were isolated. Those strains represented only 1.09% of the relative abundance compared with the total microbiota obtained by 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing. The metagenomic analysis identified 441 species. Prokaryotes were predominant (93.4%) over eukaryotes (6.6%), with Pelobacter (13.4%), Lewinella (5.6%), Marinobacter (5.4%), Hoeflea (4.2%), and Microcystis (3.1%) being the most representative genera. Laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) imaging evidenced an irregular and heterogeneous biofilm with an average thickness of 35 pm, where the heterotrophic prokaryotic community (3.4×106 cell cm-2) dominate the photoautotrophic communities (2.3×105 cell cm-2). For the first time, an A. purpuratus settlement-related biofilm was described by the next generation sequencing tool (NGS) and compared with traditional methodologies.

T1  - Assessing the Nutrient Dynamics in a Himalayan Warm Monomictic Lake
AN  - 2496731100
AB  - Thermal stratification is considered to be the most important limnological feature of deep lake ecosystems affecting a water column’s chemical characteristics thereby directly connected with lake management. The lake is also attracting the attention of management authorities, being a growing tourist destination with sustainable environmental management plan. Lake Manasbal is only true warm monomictic urban lake in Kashmir and remains thermally stratified for 8–9 months, with separate layers of epilimnion, metalimnion and hypolimnion.We noticed that in the lower part of the hypolimnion, the process of stratification is characterized by an oxygen deficit (O2 < 1 mg/L). The rate of oxygen depletion reported in the lake’s bottom layers is indicative of the water body’s more eutrophic nature. A clinograde type of pH curve with a wide range of fluctuation from top to bottom layers of water was observed. Thermal stratification of the lake allows ammonium and phosphates to pool in the hypolimnion for much of the stratification period, resulting in concentrations higher than in the epilimnion. Consequently, the lake was characterized by a nutrient-enriched hypolimnion and an epilimnion deprived of nutrients. With the advent of the lake stratification, the thermocline was formed on 15th March between 2 and 3 m and on 7th April between 4 and 6 m, which gradually moved down to 10 m on 4th July and remained at that depth until circulation. The concentration of phosphorus and nitrogen in Lake Manasbal showed an increase towards the bottom, thus revealing an inverse clinograde depth distribution. Due to stratification phenomena in this lake, the internal release and subsequent distribution of nutrients throughout water column especially phosphorus from sediment water interface after mixing is a cause of concern for management authorities as it has the potential to diminish the ecological and aesthetics of the lake.Therefore, we argue that this study will provide some valuable insights on how stratification is affecting the nutrient dynamics and will offer inputs for better management accordingly both from ecological and economic perspectives.

T1  - The unreliable concept of native range as applied to the distribution of the rusty crayfish (<i>Faxonius rusticus</i>) in North America
AN  - 2495194572
AB  - The concept of native range in invasion biology is difficult to define since, in many cases, this type of range is unknown and cannot be determined. We investigate the uncertainties related to this concept by focusing on the distribution of Faxonius rusticus (Girard, 1852), also known as the rusty crayfish, which is perceived as possibly the worst invasive crayfish species in North America. In this study, we undertake a comprehensive literature review, which includes 430 studies published between 1852 and 2018, in order to analyze the native and introduced ranges of this species. The rusty crayfish was reported to occur in 33 states in the U.S.A. and 3 Canadian Provinces. Ten of these U.S. states and one Canadian Province have been included multiple times in both the native and the non-native ranges of this crayfish. The confusion regarding the limits and history of the native range of the rusty crayfish has implications for the conservation of this species in various jurisdictions. This review also demonstrates that even for intensely studied species perceived as invasive, we often do not have a clear understanding of essential concepts such as native and non-native range.

T1  - Spatial and temporal dynamics of fish assemblages in a desert reservoir over 38 years
AN  - 2495192797
AB  - Processes associated with reservoir aging threaten the capacity of systems to continue providing productive fisheries, and declining productivity might be exacerbated by decreasing water level associated with climate change and water abstraction. Despite their prevalence in riverscapes, we know little about long-term fish dynamics in reservoirs. Using a 38-year dataset from Lake Powell, USA, we tested for changes in assemblage structure and changes in fish condition for the most abundant species. The assemblage has undergone re-ordering of species relative abundance, but the same core species captured in 1981 were still present in 2018. Five species increased in relative abundance, while two declined, and seven remained unchanged. Walleye Sander vitreus and Smallmouth Bass Micropterus dolomieu were among those increasing over time, while Channel Catfish Ictalurus punctatus and Common Carp Cyprinus carpio declined. We were not able to attribute changes in fish assemblages with a suite of abiotic and biotic variables. Condition was low and declined over time for four of the six species. Although water level declined over time, we did not observe obvious declines in basal food resources. Declining water level has reduced availability of littoral habitat and likely contributed to declines in some species associated with this zone.

T1  - Characteristics of native predators are more important than those of alien prey in determining the success of biotic resistance in marine systems
AN  - 2490401475
AB  - Predator-driven biotic resistance is known to be more effective in marine systems than in terrestrial and freshwater environments. However, there is little consensus about when such resistance can be expected to succeed or fail. Here, we reviewed case studies that investigated interactions between native marine predators and alien prey, with the aim of establishing which characteristics are important in determining the outcome of such interactions. Four potential biotic resistance outcome scenarios were identified, with these scenarios progressing from a state of no resistance to successful resistance, i.e. when an alien species is successfully excluded from the native community. Characteristics of native predators and alien prey that likely affect the outcome of biotic resistance were identified, and their presence and absence were noted for each case study. The outcome of each native predator–alien prey interaction was assigned to one of the four biotic resistance outcome scenarios, based on the conclusion of the original study. Multivariate statistics were used to examine potential differences in the suites of characteristics typifying each outcome scenario. These characteristics were found to differ significantly among scenarios, with failure of predator-driven biotic resistance occurring in cases where the alien prey typically had high fecundity, high recruitment and substantial dispersal potential. Conversely, successful biotic resistance was related to the characteristics of native predators including high abundance, strong predation pressure on alien prey, coupled with high feeding rates. This research emphasises the need to integrate information from both trophic groups to strengthen predictions about the outcomes of novel predator–prey interactions.

T1  - The use of biomimetic tools for water quality monitoring: passive samplers versus sentinel organisms
AN  - 2486883879
AB  - To evaluate the performance of artificial and biological integrative sampling strategies, dissolved concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs) and metals (Cu and Mn) were measured with passive sampler devices (PSD) enclosing hydrophobic and chelating phases, and Asiatic clams were transplanted to a polluted area in the Rio de la Plata. Water concentrations based on PSD were compared with spot water samples collected at 0, 15, 32, and 63 days of exposition. PCBs and metals displayed linear accumulation kinetics both in PSDs and bivalves, but with different slopes. PCBs slopes were 2–27 times higher in bivalves (0.3–7.9 vs. 0.1–2.6 ng g−1 d−1 in PSDs) reflecting active filtration and uptake from particles, colloids, and dissolved phase, whereas metal slopes were 2.5–11 times lower in bivalves (0.04–0.18 vs. 0.10–2.00 μg g−1 d−1 in PSDs) suggesting metal bioregulation. Truly dissolved PCB concentrations from PSD (4.0–6.9 ng.l−1) represented average 13±4 % of PCB concentrations from filtered spot water samples reflecting the operational discrimination of the PSD diffusion membrane on competing dissolved and colloidal organic phases. In contrast, PSD dissolved Cu concentrations (2.3–8.2 μg l−1) were equivalent to the spot water values (3.2–3.8 μg l−1) suggesting that Cu speciation was adequately integrated by passive sampling. On the other hand, PSD-dissolved Mn concentrations (49±38 μg l−1) were higher (p<0.05) than those from spot water samples (7±11μg l−1) possibly due to phase changes of Mn distribution related to variable redox conditions in the water. Results evidenced that the PSDs are efficient accumulators of metals and organic compounds from the truly dissolved fraction.

T1  - Long-term primary production trends in the Laurentian Great Lakes: a comparison of geochemical methods
AN  - 2485941992
AB  - Sediment cores from 12 locations throughout the Laurentian Great Lakes basin were analyzed for geochemical indicators of primary production. Sediment analytes included organic and inorganic contents, carbonates, sediment accumulation rates, total organic carbon and nitrogen concentrations, carbon and nitrogen isotope composition, and trends in spectroscopically inferred chlorophyll a (and its main diagenetic products). When multiple indicators were considered, production records related to recent cultural eutrophication and catchment activities were clear in the paleorecords. Indicators derived from loss-on-ignition (organic and inorganic content) were strongly associated with periods of human settlement in the catchments that increased overall sediment loads to the lakes. The ratio of carbon to nitrogen tracked catchment inputs of carbon, especially during periods of watershed development in western Lake Superior. Sediment records such as chlorophyll a and δ13Corg appear to be reliable indicators of trends in past algal abundance, particularly in Lake Erie, which has a well-known history of higher production and cultural eutrophication. These analytes also correlated well with past measured water quality surrogates for lake primary productivity and stressor data such as human populations in adjacent watersheds. A comparison among indicators revealed that several show redundancy as good proxies of production or productivity, though context was important. For instance, heavier isotopes of carbon and nitrogen are often prescribed as sedimentary indicators of lake productivity, but these two analytes were negatively correlated in Lake Superior, possibly due to long-term increases in cyanobacteria or changes in the nitrogen source. An increase in sediment carbonates can indicate summer blooms of cyanobacteria (a phenomenon that was clearly apparent in Lake Ontario) or catchment erosion. To make convincing geochemical inferences of primary production in the Great Lakes, it is recommended that a weight of evidence be built through the use of multiple indicators.

T1  - The Importance of Marine Bivalves in Invasive Host–Parasite Introductions
AN  - 2493697097
AB  - Although research into the ecology and impacts of invasive species is prevalent, there are knowledge gaps relating to the role of invasive species in parasite transmission. This work synthesises invasive host-parasite interactions and impacts, using marine bivalves as a model group, to consider how global movement of shellfish consignments for aquaculture purposes facilitates the unintentional transfer of invasives. We discuss how invasive species can act as both hosts or parasitic organisms themselves, and introductions may lead to diseases within the bivalve aquaculture sector. This review highlights the importance of interdisciplinary research, with particular regard to the fields of parasitology and invasion ecology. We suggest that further integrating these fields will enhance critical knowledge of marine diseases, parasite-invasive-bivalve interplay dynamics, and potential mitigation strategies, including temperature-based disease surveillance models. We also address how climate change might impact invasive species, again with a focus on marine bivalves, and the potential outcomes for parasite transmission, including changes in host/parasite distribution, life-history and virulence. We acknowledge the importance of horizon scanning for future invasive host-parasite introductions and note that increased screening of invasive species, both in their native and invaded ranges, will provide clarity on invasion dynamics and potential impacts.

T1  - The effectiveness of Virkon® S disinfectant against an invasive insect and implications for Antarctic biosecurity practices
AN  - 2494191079
AB  - The flightless midge Eretmoptera murphyi is thought to be continuing its invasion of Signy Island via the treads of personnel boots. Current boot-wash biosecurity protocols in the Antarctic region rely on microbial biocides, primarily Virkon® S. As pesticides have limited approval for use in the Antarctic Treaty area, we investigated the efficacy of Virkon® S in controlling the spread of E. murphyi using boot-wash simulations and maximum threshold exposures. We found that E. murphyi tolerates over 8 h of submergence in 1% Virkon® S. Higher concentrations increased effectiveness, but larvae still exhibited > 50% survival after 5 h in 10% Virkon® S. Salt and hot water treatments (without Virkon® S) were explored as possible alternatives. Salt water proved ineffective, with mortality only in first-instar larvae across multi-day exposures. Larvae experienced 100% mortality when exposed for 10 s to 50°C water, but they showed complete survival at 45°C. Given that current boot-wash protocols alone are an ineffective control of this invasive insect, we advocate hot water (> 50°C) to remove soil, followed by Virkon® S as a microbial biocide on ‘clean’ boots. Implications for the spread of invasive invertebrates as a result of increased human activity in the Antarctic region are discussed.

T1  - Sex-specific plasticity in a trophic polymorphic aquatic predator: a modeling approach
AN  - 2489116976
AB  - Phenotypic plasticity is common among animal taxa. While there are clearly limits and likely costs to plasticity, these costs are unknown for most organisms. Further, as plasticity is partially genetically determined, the potential magnitude of exhibited plasticity may vary among individuals. In addition to phenotypic plasticity, various animal taxa also display sexual size dimorphism, a feature ultimately thought to arise due to differential size-dependent fitness costs and benefits between sexes. We hypothesized that differential selection acting on males and females can indirectly select for unequal genetically defined plasticity potential between the sexes. We evaluate this possibility for Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis), a species that displays modest sexual size dimorphism and habitat-related morphological plasticity. Using 500-year simulations of an ecogenetic agent-based model, we demonstrate that genetically determined morphological plasticity potential may evolve differently for males and females, leading to greater realized morphological variation between habitats for one sex over the other. Genetically determined potential for plasticity evolved differently between sexes across (a) various sex-specific life-history differences and (b) a variety of assumed costs of plasticity acting on both growth and survival. Morphological analyses of Eurasian perch collected in situ were consistent with model predictions: realized morphological variation between habitats was greater for females than males. We suggest that due to sex-specific selective pressures, differences in male and female genetically defined potential for plasticity may be a common feature across organisms.

T1  - The effects of food quantity, light, and temperature on clearance rates in freshwater bivalves (Cyrenidae and Unionidae)
AN  - 2479910641
AB  - Assessing the environmental variables that influence freshwater bivalve filtration activity is key to better understand the functioning of stream ecosystems. In the present study, the effects of light (0 ± 0 µmol m−2 s−1 and 19 ± 2 µmol m−2 s−1) and temperature (10, 15, 20 and 25°C) on the clearance rates of two bivalve species: the Asian clam Corbicula fluminea (Cyrenidae) and pocketbook Lampsilis ovata (Unionidae) were assessed under controlled laboratory conditions at two different concentrations of algal food (i.e., 10,000 cells ml−1 and 100,000 cells ml−1). Clearance rates for C. fluminea varied from 0 to 491 ml g−1 h−1, while the observed range for L. ovata was 0 to 905 ml g−1 h−1. We found that the relative contribution of the tested variables was species-dependent. While temperature plays a major role in the clearance rates of C. fluminea, food concentration was the most significant variable in the clearance rate of L. ovata. Our results confirm the complex interactions between abiotic and biotic factors in freshwater bivalve filtration activity. Overall, clearance rates are highly variable especially in C. fluminea and presumably regulated by other untested factors suggesting high plasticity in filtration.

T1  - Impacts of different monoculture types on stream benthic macroinvertebrate and fish communities
AN  - 2479909205
AB  - Agribusiness is one of the main economic activities in Brazil, which caused the removal of much of its natural vegetation for the expansion of monoculture areas. Once aquatic environments have a direct relationship with the surrounding terrestrial environment, it is essential to understand the monocultures’ impact on adjacent streams and, especially, how aquatic communities react to these impacts. Our aim was to verify the effects of different monoculture types on stream benthic macroinvertebrate and fish communities’ structure. We compared the environmental characteristics and these communities’ structure in four streams located in native vegetation areas and four in each of three monoculture types (sugarcane, citrus, and eucalyptus), all belonging to the Paranapanema River basin, Southeastern Brazil. We found lower pH and dissolved oxygen and higher total phosphorus and fine substrate values in monoculture streams and these variables were also related to the lower abundance of macroinvertebrate groups more sensitive to environmental impacts. However, we did not find differences in fish communities or in their relationship with the different environmental characteristics observed. We also did not observe differences between the monoculture types in all comparisons made, which demonstrate that these plantations, although have different cultivation characteristics, cause similar negative impacts in the streams. Our study demonstrates the physical and chemical impacts of monoculture development on stream headwater communities. Regulatory measures such as increased riparian vegetation and contour farming and terracing may be critical to protect and restore headwater streams from monoculture impacts.

T1  - Harnessing the Power of Community Science to Address Data Gaps in Arctic Observing: Invasive Species in Alaska as Case Examples
AN  - 2647408541
AB  - RÉSUMÉ. L'Arctique fait l'objet de changements de taille susceptibles de s'accélérer au cours des prochaines décennies, comme l'introduction et l'intensification d'espėces envahissantes. L'Arctique se trouve dans la position unique d'empecher les nouvelles introductions et la propagation des espėces envahissantes actuelles grâce å l'adoption de politiques et de mesures visant å en faire la détection précoce. Réagir aux menaces des espėces envahissantes afin de minimiser leurs incidences sur les écosystémes, les collectivités, la sécurité alimentaire et les économies nordiques nécessitera des activités d'observation et de surveillance d'envergure. Toutefois, les gestionnaires de ressources sont souvent tenus de prendre des décisions sans posséder de données et de ressources adéquates. Les programmes d'observation locaux, comme les programmes de science citoyenne et les programmes de surveillance communautaire, constituent des méthodes intéressantes d'augmentation de la capacité d'observation qui comportent des approches contributives et créées en collaboration tout en ayant pour effet de sensibiliser les parties prenantes aux enjeux. Bien que le modéle créé en collaboration ait été appliqué et encouragé å grande échelle dans le contexte de l'Arctique, les programmes de science citoyenne contributive offrent un outil supplémentaire pour s'attaquer aux besoins d'observation dans l'Arctique. Nous présentons trois programmes de science citoyenne contributive se rapportant å l'environnement d'eau douce, å l'environnement terrestre et å l'environnement marin, programmes qui s'inscrivent dans les objectifs du partenariat de l'Alaska en matiėre d'espėces envahissantes (Alaska Invasive Species Partnership). Nous discutons des critėres nécessaires å l'atteinte des mesures prioritaires de l'ARIAS å l'échelle du participant, soit en matiėre de motivation des participants et de leur compréhension de la valeur de leurs contributions, å l'échelle programmatique, par exemple en faisant la promotion d'un échange de connaissances accessible, reciproque et transparent, et å l'échelle des politiques et des sciences pour lesquelles les mesures de gestion sont fondees sur les données. La demarche vise l'intégration réussie de la science citoyenne dans l'élaboration des politiques touchant l'Arctique. Enfin, nous discutons des défis inhérents å la collecte générale des données globales et å l'orientation future de la science citoyenne contributive au sein des réseaux d'observation de l'Arctique.Alternate abstract:The Arctic is undergoing large-scale changes that are likely to accelerate in future decades such as introductions and expansions of invasive species. The Arctic is in a unique position to prevent new introductions and spread of existing invasive species by adopting policies and actions aimed at early detection. Responding to threats from invasive species to minimize impacts to ecosystems, communities, food security, and northern economies will necessitate extensive observations and monitoring, but resource managers often face decisions without having adequate data and resources at hand. Local observing programs such as citizen science and community-based monitoring programs present attractive methods for increasing observing capacity that span contributory and co-created approaches while raising awareness of an issue among stakeholders. While the co-created model has been widely applied and encouraged in the Arctic context, contributory citizen science programs offer an additional tool for addressing observing needs in the Arctic. We showcase three contributory citizen science programs related to freshwater, terrestrial, and marine environments that have supported the objectives of the Alaska Invasive Species Partnership. We discuss criteria for achieving ARIAS priority actions at the participant scale related to participants' motivation and participants' understanding of the value of their contributions, at the programmatic scale, for example promoting accessible, reciprocal, and transparent knowledge exchange, and at the policy and science scale where management action is data driven. The approach is aimed at successful integration of citizen science into Arctic policy making. Finally, we discuss challenges related to broader global data collection and future directions for contributory citizen science within Arctic observing networks.

T1  - Natural and Anthropogenic Factors Shaping the Shoreline of Klaipėda, Lithuania
AN  - 2612800164
AB  - Port of Klaipėda is situated in a complex hydrological system, between the Curonian Lagoon and the Baltic Sea, at the Klaipėda strait in the South-Eastern part of the Baltic Sea. It has almost 300 m of jetties separating the Curonian Spit and the mainland coast, interrupting the main path of sediment transport through the South-Eastern coast of the Baltic Sea. Due to the Port of Klaipėda reconstruction in 2002 and the beach nourishment project, which was started in 2014, the shoreline position change tendency was observed. Shoreline position measurements of various periods can be used to derive quantitative estimates of coastal process directions and intensities. These data can be used to further our understanding of the scale and timing of shoreline changes in a geological and socio-economic context. This study analyzes long- and short-term shoreline position changes before and after the Port of Klaipėda reconstruction in 2002. Positions of historical shorelines from various sources were used, and the rates (EPR, NSM, and SCE) of shoreline changes have been assessed using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS). An extension of ArcGIS K-means clustering was applied for shoreline classification into different coastal dynamic stretches. Coastal development has changed in the long-term (1984–2019) perspective: the eroded coast length increased from 1.5 to 4.2 km in the last decades. Coastal accumulation processes have been restored by the Port of Klaipėda executing the coastal zone nourishment project in 2014.

T1  - Iron, Phosphorus and Trace Elements in Mussels’ Shells, Water, and Bottom Sediments from the Severnaya Dvina and the Onega River Basins (Northwestern Russia)
AN  - 2602203186
AB  - Trace elements in freshwater bivalve shells are widely used for reconstructing long-term changes in the riverine environments. However, Northern Eurasian regions, notably the European Russian North, susceptible to strong environmental impact via both local pollution and climate warming, are poorly studied. This work reports new data on trace elements accumulation by widespread species of freshwater mussels Unio spp. and Anodonta anatina in the Severnaya Dvina and the Onega River Basin, the two largest subarctic river basins in the Northeastern Europe. We revealed that iron and phosphorous accumulation in Unio spp. and Anodonta anatina shells have a strong relationship with a distance from the mouth of the studied river (the Severnaya Dvina). Based on multiparametric statistics comprising chemical composition of shells, water, and sediments, we demonstrated that the accumulation of elements in the shell depends on the environment of the biotope. Differences in the elemental composition of shells between different taxa are associated with ecological preferences of certain species to the substrate. The results set new constraints for the use of freshwater mussels’ shells for monitoring riverine environments and performing paleo-reconstructions.

T1  - Main Threats in Mediterranean Coastal Wetlands. The Ebro Delta Case
AN  - 2602099970
AB  - Coastal wetlands are dynamic ecosystems that exist at the interface between land and sea. They represent environments with a great diversity of habitats and communities, high carbon sequestration capacity and a wide range of ecosystem services. In the Mediterranean, the largest coastal wetlands are found in deltaic areas like that of the Ebro River (Spain), which has a coastline length of approximately 50 km, occupying a total area of 325 km2. The Ebro Delta is included in different national and international frameworks for environmental conservation, despite which there are several risks that threaten it. The lack of sedimentary contributions due to the regulation of the Ebro riverbed (irrigation, reservoirs, and hydroelectric power generation) has caused erosion and the retreat of certain sections of its coastline. To this situation of sediment deficit must be added the threat posed by the effects of global change, such as the rise in sea level, the increase in temperature and in the frequency and intensity of storms. This study analyses the particularities of the coastal wetland of the Ebro Delta, identifying the main threats it faces, as well as possible adaptation and mitigation strategies to these changes.

T1  - Pilot Application of ‘Invasive Alien Species in Europe’ Smartphone App in the Danube Region
AN  - 2596058747
AB  - The present pilot study tested and validated the use of the ‘Invasive Alien Species in Europe’ smartphone app (IASapp) in the Lower Danube Region. The study was conducted in three stages: (1) Testing the effectiveness of the app in Bulgaria, Romania and Serbia by organizing information and field testing campaigns; (2) Improving and extending the functionality of the app and developing a list of the invasive alien species (IAS) of concern to the Danube River Basin (DRB); and (3) Testing the updated app during the Joint Danube Survey 4 campaign. Overall, 13 campaigns were carried out, during which seven aquatic IAS of EU concern and nine IAS relevant to the DRB were recorded. Currently, the developed new functionality of IASapp allows the recording of 64 IAS of DRB concern. The updated IASapp has an important role in increasing public awareness on IAS issues, as well as in enlarging the participation and output of citizen science in the IAS early detection, monitoring and reporting in the DRB. Therefore, the constant communication with existing stakeholder groups and establishment of new citizen science groups is crucial for increasing the effectiveness of using the IASapp in the Danube Region and tackling the IAS issues.

T1  - Impacts Analysis of Alien Macroinvertebrate Species in the Hydrographic System of a Subalpine Lake on the Italian–Swiss Border
AN  - 2596058641
AB  - The potential invasiveness of alien macroinvertebrate species in the Italian/Swiss hydrographic system of Lake Maggiore (NW Italy) was assessed through the Aquatic Species Invasiveness Screening Kit, a risk assessment tool developed for quantifying the impacts of alien species on the commercial, environmental, and species traits sectors. Data were collected using the databases provided by two regional environmental agencies in northern Italy (Lombardy and Piedmont regions) and by the governmental monitoring program of Switzerland, which were integrated with a systematic literature search on Google scholar and ISI Web of Science. In the assessment area, 16 macroinvertebrate invasive alien species were reported: nine mollusks, four decapods, and three amphipods. The species assessment indicated seven species with a high level of invasiveness: Procambarus clarkii, Faxonius limosus (formerly, Orconectes limosus) and Pacifastacus leniusculus, Dreissena polymorpha, Corbicula fluminea, Sinanodonta woodiana, and Pseudosuccinea columella. The results allow invasive species managers to understand which species to focus their monitoring on in the near future in order to track IAS movements and limit their spread within the hydrographic system and to provide the identification and refinement of concerted bilateral strategies aimed at limiting the impacts of these species. They also account for the implications of future climate change on the invasion potential of each species.

T1  - Status of Freshwater Mussels (Unionidae) in the French Creek Watershed, USA at the Onset of Invasion by Round Goby, <i>Neogobius melanostomus</i>
AN  - 2596058517
AB  - Freshwater mussels are an imperiled group of organisms that are vital to aquatic ecosystems. Services performed by freshwater mussels, coupled with their use for biomonitoring, make them an invaluable asset. Neogobius melanostomus (Round Goby), a recently introduced invasive species to the French Creek watershed, was once restricted to the watershed of Lake Erie in Pennsylvania. The Round Goby’s propensity to consume Dreissena polymorpha (Zebra Mussel) and Dreissena bugensis (Quagga Mussel) in their native habitat raises concerns about this recent introduction into Pennsylvania’s Allegheny River watershed. Since the discovery of their introduction within the watershed, we have followed the range expansion and dispersal rate of Round Gobies, which makes this study unique. The objectives of this study were to quantify baseline data on the contemporary diversity and abundance of unionid mussels in the upper French Creek watershed, and to explore potential habitat factors that influence or limit the size of the mussel populations. We gathered baseline data on freshwater mussel diversity and abundances across eight sites in the French Creek watershed and examined substrate particle size and host availability as potential limiting factors of the freshwater mussel distribution. Freshwater mussel surveys were conducted during the summer months (July–September) of 2017 using area-constrained surveys. Results showed a significant relationship between mussel diversity and substrate particle size (p < 0.05). From the data collected, we were able to calculate population estimates for the species found across the sample sites. Our results regarding the locations of native mussel populations and characteristics of their habitat provide the needed insight for establishing priority areas for the conservation of freshwater mussels, facilitating planning for protection, mitigation, and adaptation as the invasive Round Goby continues its spread.

T1  - Genotoxicity of Polystyrene (PS) Microspheres in Short-Term Exposure to Gametes of the Sand Dollar <i>Scaphechinus mirabilis</i> (Agassiz, 1864) (Echinodermata, Echinoidea)
AN  - 2584404727
AB  - Microplastic pollution appears to be one of the major environmental problems in the world today, and researchers have been paying special attention to the study of the impact of microplastics on biota. In this article, we studied the short-term effects of polystyrene micro-spheres on genome integrity using the gametes of the Scaphechinus mirabilis sand dollar with the comet assay method. This highly sensitive method allowed us to identify the level of genome damage in both gametes before and after short-term exposure to PS microparticles. It was shown that primary polystyrene microspheres at concentrations of 104, 105, and 106 particles/L had a genotoxic effect during short-term exposure to the sperm of the sand dollar S. mirabilis, which was expressed as a significant increase in sperm DNA damage. The highest percentage of DNA damage (more than 20%) was detected in spermatozoa exposed for 1 h in water containing 105 microspheres of plastic per 1 L. Additionally, at all concentrations of microplastic studied in the experiment, the genetic damage index (GDI) values in spermatozoa exceeded the control level. However, regardless of the level of DNA damage, spermatozoa retained the ability to fertilise eggs with up to 97% efficiency. We must acknowledge that the genotoxic property of microplastic against sperm to some extent predicts the development of long-term adverse effects of environmental significance.

T1  - Designing the Next Generation of Condition Tracking and Early Warning Systems for Shellfish Aquaculture
AN  - 2584402692
AB  - Early detection of environmental disturbances affecting shellfish stock condition is highly desirable for aquaculture activities. In this article, a new biophysical model-based early warning system (EWS) is described, that assesses bivalve stock condition by diagnosing signs of persistent physiological dysfunctioning. The biophysical model represents valve gape dynamics, controlled by active contractions of the adductor muscle countering the passive action of the hinge ligament; the dynamics combine continuous convergence to a steady-state interspersed with discrete closing events. A null simulation was introduced to describe undisturbed conditions. The diagnostic compares valve gape measurements and simulations. Indicators are inferred from the model parameters, and disturbances are assessed when their estimates deviate from their null distribution. Instead of focusing only on discrete events, our EWS exploits the complete observed dynamics within successive time intervals defined by the variation scales. When applied to a valvometry data series, collected in controlled conditions from scallops (Pecten maximus), the EWS indicated that one among four individuals exhibited signs its physiological condition was degrading. This was detected neither during experiments nor during the initial data analysis, suggesting the utility of an approach that quantifies physiological mechanisms underlying functional responses. Practical implementations of biological-EWS at farming sites are then discussed.

T1  - Open Lake Phosphorus Forcing of <i>Cladophora</i> Growth: Modeling the Dual Challenge in Great Lakes Trophic State Management
AN  - 2581042491
AB  - Stimulated by excess levels of phosphorus, the attached, filamentous green alga Cladophora grows to nuisance proportions in Lake Michigan, one of the Laurentian Great Lakes. While nearshore waters impacted by local sources of the nutrient continue to support nuisance conditions, offshore waters have undergone oligotrophication in response to reductions in phosphorus loading and benthification of phosphorus cycling by invasive dreissenid mussels. A concept termed the Dual Challenge recognizes that implementation of more stringent phosphorus-loading objectives (to control Cladophora in the nearshore) stands in conflict with a foreseen need to mitigate oligotrophication in the offshore (to sustain a healthy fishery). Attention to this nearshore–offshore dynamic calls into play the role of cross-margin phosphorus transport in mediating both endmembers of the conflict. We applied a biophysical model simulating soluble reactive (SRP) and particulate (PP) phosphorus, mussel biokinetics, and cross-margin mass transport in addressing the Dual Challenge. Pre- and post-dreissenid monitoring results suggest that a reduction in offshore PP levels (food web nutrition) in excess of 40% (2.4 to 1.4 mgP·m−3) has driven oligotrophication and attendant food web dysfunction. Yet, in the absence of local sources, model-predicted nearshore SRP levels remain at or below those required to prevent nuisance growth. These findings indicate that there is a margin of ~1 mgP·m−3 over which offshore PP levels could be increased (to the benefit of the food web and the fishery) without hindering efforts to reduce nuisance algal growth through local source control.

T1  - An Acoustic Treatment to Mitigate the Effects of the Apple Snail on Agriculture and Natural Ecosystems
AN  - 2576449014
AB  - Global change is the origin of increased occurrence of disturbance events in natural communities, with biological invasions constituting a major threat to ecosystem integrity and functioning. The apple snail (Pomacea maculata) is a freshwater gastropod mollusk from South America. Considered one of the 100 most harmful invasive species in the world, due to its voracity, resistance, and high reproductive rate, it has become a global problem for wetland crops. In Catalonia, it has affected the rice fields of the Ebre Delta since 2010 with significant negative impact on the local economy. As a gastropod mollusc it possesses statocysts consisting of a pair of sacs, one located on each side of the foot, that contain multiple calcium carbonate statoconia. This study shows the first ultrastructural images of pathological changes in the sensory epithelium of the statocyst of apple snail adults with an increase in the severity of the lesions over time after exposure to low frequency sounds. Sound-induced damage to the statocyst could likely result in an inhibition of its vital functions resulting in a potential reduction in the survival ability of the apple snail and lead to an effective mitigation method for reducing damage to rice fields.

T1  - Do Single-Component and Mixtures Selected Organic UV Filters Induce Embryotoxic Effects in Zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>)?
AN  - 2565720031
AB  - UVs are important ingredients in common cosmetic products (e.g., sunscreens, hairsprays, soap). After their use, they can enter the aquatic ecosystem and negatively affect non-target aquatic organisms. The aim of our study was to evaluate acute embryotoxicity of selected organic UVs 2-phenylbenzimidazole-5-sulfonic acid (PBSA), ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate (EHMC), octocrylene (OC), 4-methylbenzylidene camphor (4-MBC) and benzophenone-3 (BP-3). The chemicals were tested both as a single substance and their mixtures. The types of mixtures were chosen as follows: the combination of OC and 4-MBC; the combination of PBSA, EHMC and BP-3 and the combination of all five UV filters. The embryotoxicity was evaluated using a modified method of the Fish Embryo Acute Toxicity Test-OECD guideline 236 and zebrafish (Danio rerio) was selected as a suitable fish model organism. The toxic effects were studied by assessing mortality, hatching and the occurrence of malformations at 24, 48, 72 and 96 h post fertilization. The obtained results indicate that especially the mixture of OC and 4-MBC presents a potential risk of embryotoxicity for zebrafish due to a significant increase in mortality, which was 41.7% in the experimental group exposed to 10 μg/L at 96 h post fertilization. Based on our results, the most effected sub-lethal endpoints were hatching and malformation (e.g., edema of pericard, bent spine, yolk edema), but with no statistically significant effect. These results differ within groups with single UVs and with their mixtures, suggesting the interaction of these substances when they are exposed together.

There is a great diversity of enteric viruses and fecal bacteriophages, especially F-specific RNA bacteriophages (FRNAPHs), are commonly proposed as indicators of viral pollution due to a variety of characteristics such as their structural similarities to the main enteric viruses, their high concentrations in raw wastewater and their environmental survival rate, which is better than other cultivable enteric viruses. However, evaluating the viral contamination of water on the basis of FRNAPH concentration levels continues to present a challenge. This is because the quality of detection is strongly dependent on the quantity of viral particles, high spatio-temporal variabilities and the physico-chemical conditions of the water during sampling. To overcome these limitations, the present study aims to evaluate whether the bivalve mollusk Dreissena polymorpha (zebra mussel) could be considered a suitable experimental model for assessing the viral contamination of rivers. In order to determine this, the capacity of D. polymorpha to accumulate FRNAPHs and assimilate them into their soft tissue was studied. This provided a proof of concept for the use of D. polymorpha to evaluate the viral contamination of surface water. Two experiments were conducted: (1) an in situ experiment to confirm that zebra mussels naturally accumulated FRNAPHs and (2) a laboratory experiment to determine the accumulation and depuration kinetics of FRNAPHs in D. polymorpha tissue. The study highlights the capacity of the mussels to accumulate infectious FRNAPHs both on a laboratory scale under controlled conditions as well as in situ at different sites that are representative of different bodies of water. An analysis of the mussels’ soft tissue showed that they were capable of reflecting the water’s contamination level very quickly (within less than 24 h). Moreover, the soft tissue retained the viral load much longer than the water due to a low depuration rate. The analysis of FRNAPH concentrations in mussels exposed in situ suggested that there were differences in contamination levels between sites. These preliminary results underline the potential utility of zebra mussels in assessing viral contamination by measuring the accumulation of FRNAPHs in their tissue. This may ultimately enable stakeholders to use zebra mussels as a means of monitoring viral pollution in surface water.

AB  - We optimized a methodology for plankton environmental DNA detection of the invasive golden mussel and validated it in samples from a Southern Brazil reservoir. Limnoperna fortunei is a successful invasive alien species that causes significant impacts on freshwater ecosystems. We adjusted and validated the methodology to detect L. fortunei in plankton samples, with a SYBR Green assay. Based on the standard curve analysis, the observed theoretical minimal qPCR detection level was 0.0005625 ng.µL-1 (R2 = 0.99) at a PCR quantification cycle of 14.09-29.56. We also presented a practical guide to be used in monitoring and detection of L. fortunei. The optimized protocol was efficient in detecting L. fortunei and can be used to monitor already infested environments or invasions in new environments.Alternate abstract:Resumo: Nós otimizamos uma metodologia para detecção do mexilhão-dourado em amostras de DNA ambiental de plâncton e a validamos em amostras de um reservatório no sul do Brasil. Limnoperna fortunei é uma especie exótica invasora bem-sucedida que promove impactos significativos nos ecossistemas de água doce. Nós ajustamos e validamos a metodologia para detectar L. fortunei em amostras de plancton em reservatório, através de ensaios com SYBR Green. O nivel teórico mínimo de detecção de qPCR observado, com base na análise de curva padräo, foi de 0,0005625 ng.µL-1 (R2 = 0,99) em um ciclo de quantificaçâo de 14,09-29,56. Nós também apresentamos um guia prático a ser utilizado no monitoramento da invasão de L. fortunei em bacías hidrográficas. A metodologia ajustada foi eficiente na detecção de L. fortunei e, portanto, pode ser usada para monitorar ambientes já infestados ou invasões em novos ambientes em larga escala.

T1  - Lake Users’ Perceptions of Environmental Change: Ecosystem Services and Disservices Associated with Aquatic Plants
AN  - 2539998069
AB  - Lake Léman (Lake Geneva), Switzerland, is known to have undergone major environmental change over the last few decades, including changes in the abundance, distribution, and species composition of macrophytic plants (aquatic plants). In this study, questionnaires and key informant interviews were used to assess lake users’ perceptions of broad scale environmental change in the lake paying special attention tochanges in the abundance of aquatic plants and the perceived ecosystem services (ES) and ecosystem disservices (EDS) associated with them. In addition, we assessed whether users’ perceptions of aquatic plants had an impact on perceived management need. Most respondents (63%) perceived aquatic plant abundance to have increased over the last 10 years, primarily because of climate change. Aquatic plants were seen to benefit water quality through improved regulation and supporting services, and to provide important habitat and food for fauna. Most EDS associated with increased aquatic plant abundance were categorized as cultural or economic. User perceptions of the ES and EDS associated with aquatic plants affected support for management (60% of respondents supported some form of management), and such information is important for informing environmental decision making.

T1  - Effects of the Fragrance Galaxolide on the Biomarker Responses of the Clam <i>Ruditapes philippinarum</i>
AN  - 2532341789
AB  - The musk fragrance Galaxolide® (HHCB) is widely used in personal care and household products. Its large use leads to a continuous release of the compound into aquatic environments. Although some studies on the presence of HHCB in ecosystems and biota have been conducted, limited data about its effects on organism biomarkers are available. This study aimed at investigating both cellular and biochemical effects of HHCB in the clam Ruditapes philippinarum. Mussels were exposed for 7, 14 and 21 days to 100 ng/L and 500 ng/L of HHCB in seawater, and the effects on haemocyte parameters and antioxidant enzyme activities in the gills and digestive gland were evaluated. In addition, the neurotoxic potential of HHCB and its capacity to cause oxidative damage to proteins were assessed. Overall, our results demonstrated that exposure to HHCB was able to induce changes in biomarker responses of mussels, mainly at the cellular level.

T1  - Decoupling salinity and carbonate chemistry: low calcium ion concentration rather than salinity limits calcification in Baltic Sea mussels
AN  - 2516163345
AB  - The Baltic Sea has a salinity gradient decreasing from fully marine (> 25) in the west to below 7 in the central Baltic Proper. Habitat-forming and ecologically dominant mytilid mussels exhibit decreasing growth when salinity < 11; however, the mechanisms underlying reduced calcification rates in dilute seawater are not fully understood. Both [HCO3-] and [Ca2+] also decrease with salinity, challenging calcifying organisms through CaCO3 undersaturation (Ω≤1) and unfavourable ratios of calcification substrates ([Ca2+] and [HCO3-]) to the inhibitor (H+), expressed as the extended substrate–inhibitor ratio (ESIR). This study combined in situ monitoring of three southwest Baltic mussel reefs with two laboratory experiments to assess how various environmental conditions and isolated abiotic factors (salinity, [Ca2+], [HCO3-] and pH) impact calcification in mytilid mussels along the Baltic salinity gradient. Laboratory experiments rearing juvenile Baltic Mytilus at a range of salinities (6, 11 and 16), HCO3- concentrations (300–2100 µmol kg-1) and Ca2+ concentrations (0.5–4 mmol kg-1) reveal that as individual factors, low [HCO3-], pH and salinity cannot explain low calcification rates in the Baltic Sea. Calcification rates are impeded when Ωaragonite ≤ 1 or ESIR ≤ 0.7 primarily due to [Ca2+] limitation which becomes relevant at a salinity of ca. 11 in the Baltic Sea. Field monitoring of carbonate chemistry and calcification rates suggest increased food availability may be able to mask the negative impacts of periodic sub-optimal carbonate chemistry, but not when seawater conditions are permanently adverse, as observed in two Baltic reefs at salinities < 11. Regional climate models predict a rapid desalination of the southwest and central Baltic over the next century and potentially a reduction in [Ca2+] which may shift the distribution of marine calcifiers westward. It is therefore vital to understand the mechanisms by which the ionic composition of seawater impacts bivalve calcification for better predicting the future of benthic Baltic ecosystems.

T1  - Cyanobacteria blooms in the Baltic Sea: a review of models and facts
AN  - 2511821682
AB  - The ecosystem of the Baltic Sea is endangered by eutrophication. This has triggered expensive international management efforts. Some of these efforts are impeded by natural processes such as nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria blooms that add bioavailable nitrogen to the already over-fertilized system and thereby enhance primary production, export of organic matter to depth, and associated oxygen consumption. Controls of cyanobacteria blooms are not comprehensively understood, and this adds to the uncertainty of model-based projections into the warming future of the Baltic Sea. Here we review our current understanding of cyanobacteria bloom dynamics. We summarize published field studies and laboratory experiments and dissect the basic principles ingrained in state-of-the-art coupled ocean–circulation biogeochemical models.

T1  - First report of detection of microcystins in farmed mediterranean mussels <i>Mytilus galloprovincialis</i> in Thermaikos gulf in Greece
AN  - 2502601072
AB  - Background
Microcystins are emerging marine biotoxins, produced by potentially toxic cyanobacteria. Their presence has been reported in aquatic animals in Greek freshwater, while data are few in marine environments. Since the climate change induces eutrophication and harmful algal blooms in coastal marine ecosystems affecting the public health, further research on microcystins’ presence in marine waters is required. The aim of this study was to examine the potential presence of microcystins in mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis in the largest farming areas in Thermaikos gulf, in Northern Greece, and to investigate their temporal and spatial distribution, adding to the knowledge of microcystins presence in Greek Mediterranean mussels.
Results
A 4-year microcystins’ assessment was conducted from 2013 to 2016, in farmed Mediterranean mussels M. galloprovincialis, in five sampling areas in Thermaikos gulf, in northern Greece, where the 90% of the Greek mussels’ farming activities is located. The isolation of potentially toxic cyanobacteria was confirmed by molecular methods. An initial screening was performed with a qualitative and quantitative direct monoclonal (DM) ELISA and results above 1 ng g−1 were confirmed for the occurrence of the most common microcystins-RR, -LR and -YR, by Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC) coupled with a high- resolution mass spectrometer (HRMS) (Orbitrap analyzer). Microcystin-RR and microcystin-LR were detected, while the intensity of microcystin-YR was below the method detection limit. Most samples that exhibited concentrations above 1 ng g-1 were detected during the warm seasons of the year and especially in spring. Results indicated an overestimation of the ELISA method, since concentrations ranged between 0.70 ± 0.15 ng g−1 and 53.90 ± 3.18 ng g−1, while the confirmation denoted that the levels of microcystins were 6 to 22 times lower.
Conclusions
Microcystin-RR and microcystin-LR were detected for the first time in mussel M. galloprovincialis, harvested from farms in Thermaikos gulf, in Central Macedonia, Greece. Their presence was linked to potentially toxic cyanobacteria. Bioaccumulation was observed in digestive gland, while the concentrations in muscles were found extremely low. Samples with levels above 1 ng g−1 were observed mostly during spring, confirming the seasonal distribution of microcystins. The comparison of the results by the ELISA and the LC-Orbitrap MS method indicated an overestimation of concentration by the ELISA method.

T1  - Effects of the Marine Biotoxins Okadaic Acid and Dinophysistoxins on Fish
AN  - 2500632359
AB  - Natural high proliferations of toxin-producing microorganisms in marine and freshwater environments result in dreadful consequences at the socioeconomically and environmental level due to water and seafood contamination. Monitoring programs and scientific evidence point to harmful algal blooms (HABs) increasing in frequency and intensity as a result of global climate alterations. Among marine toxins, the okadaic acid (OA) and the related dinophysistoxins (DTX) are the most frequently reported in EU waters, mainly in shellfish species. These toxins are responsible for human syndrome diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP). Fish, like other marine species, are also exposed to HABs and their toxins. However, reduced attention has been given to exposure, accumulation, and effects on fish of DSP toxins, such as OA. The present review intends to summarize the current knowledge of the impact of DSP toxins and to identify the main issues needing further research. From data reviewed in this work, it is clear that exposure of fish to DSP toxins causes a range of negative effects, from behavioral and morphological alterations to death. However, there is still much to be investigated about the ecological and food safety risks related to contamination of fish with DSP toxins.

T1  - Lake thermal structure drives interannual variability in summer anoxia dynamics in a eutrophic lake over 37 years
AN  - 2492849481
AB  - The concentration of oxygen is fundamental to lake water quality and ecosystem functioning through its control over habitat availability for organisms, redox reactions, and recycling of organic material. In many eutrophic lakes, oxygen depletion in the bottom layer (hypolimnion) occurs annually during summer stratification. The temporal and spatial extent of summer hypolimnetic anoxia is determined by interactions between the lake and its external drivers (e.g., catchment characteristics, nutrient loads, meteorology) as well as internal feedback mechanisms (e.g., organic matter recycling, phytoplankton blooms). How these drivers interact to control the evolution of lake anoxia over decadal timescales will determine, in part, the future lake water quality. In this study, we used a vertical one-dimensional hydrodynamic–ecological model (GLM-AED2) coupled with a calibrated hydrological catchment model (PIHM-Lake) to simulate the thermal and water quality dynamics of the eutrophic Lake Mendota (USA) over a 37 year period. The calibration and validation of the lake model consisted of a global sensitivity evaluation as well as the application of an optimization algorithm to improve the fit between observed and simulated data. We calculated stability indices (Schmidt stability, Birgean work, stored internal heat), identified spring mixing and summer stratification periods, and quantified the energy required for stratification and mixing. To qualify which external and internal factors were most important in driving the interannual variation in summer anoxia, we applied a random-forest classifier and multiple linear regressions to modeled ecosystem variables (e.g., stratification onset and offset, ice duration, gross primary production). Lake Mendota exhibited prolonged hypolimnetic anoxia each summer, lasting between 50–60 d. The summer heat budget, the timing of thermal stratification, and the gross primary production in the epilimnion prior to summer stratification were the most important predictors of the spatial and temporal extent of summer anoxia periods in Lake Mendota. Interannual variability in anoxia was largely driven by physical factors: earlier onset of thermal stratification in combination with a higher vertical stability strongly affected the duration and spatial extent of summer anoxia. A measured step change upward in summer anoxia in 2010 was unexplained by the GLM-AED2 model. Although the cause remains unknown, possible factors include invasion by the predacious zooplankton Bythotrephes longimanus. As the heat budget depended primarily on external meteorological conditions, the spatial and temporal extent of summer anoxia in Lake Mendota is likely to increase in the near future as a result of projected climate change in the region.

T1  - Diversity and Structure of Pelagic Zooplankton (Crustacea, Rotifera) in NE Poland
AN  - 2489135583
AB  - This study presents the diversity and structure of pelagic zooplankton in north-eastern Poland. The research was conducted in 47 lakes with different trophic conditions in the middle of summer. Samples were collected close to the deepest part of the lakes to avoid the diverse benthic and littoral zones. We found 119 zooplankton species of which 32 were Cladocera, 16 were Cyclopoida, 4 were Calanoida, and 67 were Rotifera. We determined which species occurred most frequently in the region, as well as the species that were characteristic of different trophic conditions. We also recorded the presence of eight cold-adapted species which some of them are considered as glacial relicts (e.g., Eurytemora lacustris, Heterocope appendiculata, Cyclops lacustris). Our research revealed potential glacial refugia for planktonic species in 14 lakes of NE Poland. Our study suggests that the presence of stenotherm species may be an excellent indicator of the ecological status of deep lakes and could be considered in lake monitoring programs. Furthermore, we did not find Bythotrephes longimanus which has been reported from Poland. Instead, we found that B. brevimanus was the most common representative of the genus in the study area.

T1  - Use of the Zebra Mussel Dreissena polymorpha (Mollusca, Bivalvia) as a Bioindicator of Microplastics Pollution in Freshwater Ecosystems: A Case Study from Lake Iseo (North Italy)
AN  - 2488510820
AB  - The monitoring of microplastics pollution in freshwater environments trails behind its practice in marine ecosystems. We evaluated the use of the invasive zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) as a potential bioindicator of microplastic litter in freshwater lakes. Samples were collected from three sites (Lovere, Costa Volpino, Castro) at the northern end of Lake Iseo (one of the major subalpine lakes in north Italy) and compared for water physicochemical parameters, biometrical features of zebra mussels, and microplastics items/specimens (color, shape, size, and chemical composition). We hypothesized that since a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) on the Oglio River discharges into this area of the lake, the microplastics in D.polymorpha could be measured and compared in samples from the three sites at different distances from the WWTP. There was no difference in the physicochemical water parameters and biometric features between the samples from the three sites, whereas there was a significant difference in items/specimen between the sites in decreasing order (mean ± standard deviation): Costa Volpino (0.23 ± 0.43) > Lovere (0.07 ± 0.25) > Castro (0.03 ± 0.18). The chi-square test showed a significant difference in shape, color, and chemical composition frequency in the samples from the three sites. The chemical composition of the microplastics was polyethylene terephthalate (45%), nylon (20%), polypropylene (20%), polyamide resin (10%), and polyvinyl chloride (5%). Our data show that the amount of microplastics the zebra mussel accumulated was greater the closer the sampling site to the WWTP. Our findings suggest that the zebra mussel may provide a useful tool to monitor microplastics pollution in lakes.

T1  - Multi-Biomarker Responses of Asian Clam Corbicula fluminea (Bivalvia, Corbiculidea) to Cadmium and Microplastics Pollutants
AN  - 2487097491
AB  - One of the most widespread aquatic organisms in the rivers and estuarine ecosystems, in the world, is Asian clam Corbiculafluminea. This clam, that can adapt to environmental changes, is an invasive species in several areas and it was adopted as a model for toxicity tests. This study evaluated the effects of the exposure to cadmium (Cd), to microplastics (MPs) and their mixtures on C. fluminea. The oxidative stress responses, lipid peroxidation (LPO), changes in the activity of energy-related enzymes and neurotoxicity were assessed on the gill, digestive gland and gonad. The results show that Cd, MPs and their mixtures cause oxidative stress, damage and neurotoxicity. The enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and the LPO levels could be chosen as biomarkers of Cd pollution. Exposure to MPs induced an increase in reduced/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) ratio and increased AChE activity. The combined exposure to Cd and MPs caused a synergetic effect in gill and gonad, while an antagonism response was recorded in the digestive gland. The results provide new insights for unveiling the biologic effects of heavy metal, microplastics and their mixtures on C. fluminea. Besides, we demonstrated that the Asian clam is a good bioindicator of microplastic pollution that can occur in aquatic environments.

T1  - Management of the Phosphorus–Cladophora Dynamic at a Site on Lake Ontario Using a Multi-Module Bioavailable P Model
AN  - 2486399528
AB  - The filamentous green alga Cladophora grows to nuisance proportions in Lake Ontario. Stimulated by high phosphorus concentrations, nuisance growth results in the degradation of beaches and clogging of industrial water intakes with attendant loss of beneficial uses. We develop a multi-module bioavailable phosphorus model to examine the efficacy of phosphorus management strategies in mitigating nuisance algal growth. The model platform includes modules simulating hydrodynamics (FVCOM), phosphorus-phytoplankton dynamics (GEM) and Cladophora growth (GLCMv3). The model is applied along a 25 km stretch of the Lake Ontario nearshore, extending east from Toronto, ON and receiving effluent from three wastewater treatment plants. Simulation results identify the Duffin Creek wastewater treatment plant effluent as a driving force for nuisance conditions of Cladophora growth, as reflected in effluent bioavailable phosphorus concentrations and the dimensions of the plant’s phosphorus footprint. Simulation results demonstrate that phosphorus removal by chemically enhanced secondary treatment is insufficient to provide relief from nuisance conditions. Tertiary treatment (chemically enhanced secondary treatment with ballasted flocculation) is shown to eliminate phosphorus-saturated conditions associated with the Duffin Creek wastewater treatment plant effluent, providing local relief from nuisance conditions. Management guidance presented here has wider application at sites along the highly urbanized Canadian nearshore of Lake Ontario.

T1  - Adsorption characteristics of ammonium onto biochar from an aqueous solution
AN  - 2486132852
AB  - Ammonium contamination in water is a major concern worldwide. This study focuses on the removal of ammonium from aqueous solution by batch adsorption experiments using biochar derived from a combination of various wood chips (spruce, pine, and fir). Adsorption characteristics of ammonium onto biochar were evaluated as a function of biochar dosages, initial concentrations of ammonium, contact time and pH. Results demonstrated that ammonium removal increased with the increase of biochar dosage. The percentage of ammonium removal reached a value of 80% at a biochar dosage of 100 g/L. Ammonium removal decreased by 15% with the increase of initial ammonium concentration by 50 mg/L. The optimum pH for ammonium removal was considered in the range from 6 to 8. Ammonium removal reached its stable value within 3 days. The maximum adsorption capacity of ammonium was 0.96 mg/g for 80 mg/L of initial ammonium concentration. The adsorption isotherm followed both the Langmuir and Freundich models for ammonium adsorption onto biochar. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy results indicated the presence of amine, amide and nitrile functional groups on the surface of biochar which could contribute to the adsorption of ammonium onto biochar. Thus, biochar derived from various wood chips showed the potential to remove ammonium from aqueous solution.

T1  - Effectiveness of peracetic acid and EarthTec QZ for controlling zebra and quagga mussels in drinking water treatment plants on Lake Ontario
AN  - 2486132604
AB  - Prechlorination is the most common strategy for zebra and quagga mussel control in drinking water treatment plant intakes in the Great Lakes region. Although effective and inexpensive, chlorine can form regulated disinfection byproducts. Two potential alternatives to prechlorination were evaluated for mussel control: peracetic acid (PAA) and EarthTec QZ, a copper-based product. Pilot-scale experiments were conducted to test EarthTec QZ for veliger control and to evaluate the efficiency of PAA and EarthTec QZ for adult mussel control. EarthTec QZ doses of 30, 60, and 120 μg/L as copper ions demonstrated dose-dependent veliger control at 12 °C. PAA doses of 5, 10, and 25 mg/L were effective for adult mussel control at the low water temperatures tested (4 °C). Results from this study indicate that PAA and EarthTec QZ may be an alternative to prechlorination.

T1  - Physiological, Developmental, and Biomarker Responses of Zebrafish Embryos to Sub-Lethal Exposure of Bendiocarb
AN  - 2479378267
AB  - Bendiocarb is a broad-spectrum insecticide recommended for malaria control by the World Health Organization (WHO). Still, bendiocarb poses a toxic risk to populations of nontargeted aquatic organisms. Thus, our study was aimed to evaluate the sub-lethal effects of bendiocarb exposure on zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos by assessing of physiological, developmental, and biochemical parameters. Bendiocarb-induced adverse effects on embryonic development, larval growth, heart rate, changes in phase II detoxifying enzyme glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity, oxidative stress-related enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT)), and the damage-linked biomarker lipid peroxidation (LPO) in early life stage zebrafish were investigated. Our results highlight that the selected nonlethal concentrations (96 h median lethal concentration in this study was 32.52 mg/L−1) of bendiocarb inflicted adverse effects resulting in embryo deformities (96 h EC50 = 2.30 mg L−1), reduced body- and notochord length (above 0.75 and 0.39 mg L−1 bendiocarb concentrations at 96 hpf, respectively), oxidative stress, and altered heart rate (above 0.4 mg L−1 at 48 hpf) in the studied model system.

T1  - Phytoplankton and anthropogenic changes in pelagic environments
AN  - 2473395125
AB  - “Phytoplankton” is a loosely defined functional term, indicating a group of organisms distributed into several taxonomic groups ranging from oxygenic photosynthetic bacteria to a number of eukaryotic classes included in protists. The range of specializations and adaptations of phytoplankton to a wide variety of environmental conditions is astounding. This demonstrates the susceptibility of highly different populations to react rapidly to environmental changes generated by natural stressors and anthropogenic impacts. The aim of this work is to critically review the state of the art of knowledge about the impact of anthropogenic stress factors on phytoplankton composition and structure. At present, the two most important environmental stressors are represented by climate change and eutrophication, which act globally and at regional/local scales, respectively. Along with effects mediated by many other legacy and emerging stressors (briefly reviewed), the effects of these two main changes have been analysed at different levels of phytoplankton organization, i.e. individuals, populations and communities. It is stressed that a better knowledge will be obtained by extending the focus of studies from organisms detectable by light microscopy to the whole range of protists and microbial populations detected with the use of “omics” technologies, including e.g. next generation sequencing and ecological metabolomics.

T1  - What Colin Reynolds could tell us about nutrient limitation, N:P ratios and eutrophication control
AN  - 2473383944
AB  - Colin Reynolds exquisitely consolidated our understanding of driving forces shaping phytoplankton communities and those setting the upper limit to biomass yield, with limitation typically shifting from light in winter to phosphorus in spring. Nonetheless, co-limitation is frequently postulated from enhanced growth responses to enrichments with both N and P or from N:P ranging around the Redfield ratio, concluding a need to reduce both N and P in order to mitigate eutrophication. Here, we review the current understanding of limitation through N and P and of co-limitation. We conclude that Reynolds is still correct: (i) Liebig’s law of the minimum holds and reducing P is sufficient, provided concentrations achieved are low enough; (ii) analyses of nutrient limitation need to exclude evidently non-limiting situations, i.e. where soluble P exceeds 3–10 µg/l, dissolved N exceeds 100–130 µg/l and total P and N support high biomass levels with self-shading causing light limitation; (iii) additionally decreasing N to limiting concentrations may be useful in specific situations (e.g. shallow waterbodies with high internal P and pronounced denitrification); (iv) management decisions require local, situation-specific assessments. The value of research on stoichiometry and co-limitation lies in promoting our understanding of phytoplankton ecophysiology and community ecology.

T1  - High connectivity and migration potentiate the invasion of <i>Limnoperna fortunei</i> (Mollusca: Mytilidae) in South America
AN  - 2473252743
AB  - Even after almost 30 years of Limnoperna fortunei introduction into South America, it is still unclear how the source and propagules are connected. Here, we present genetic evidence of population connectivity and gene flow of L. fortunei propagules from Asia into South America, proposing the main invasion routes into South America. To achieve that we expanded the sampling effort to cover all occurrence points of L. fortunei in South America. We sequenced the mtDNA COI gene and genotyped eight microsatellite loci (ML), and we evaluated the genetic source of the recently introduced population in Sobradinho hydroelectric power plant reservoir in Northeast Brazil. Our results revealed that China is the main genetic source of propagules for the Sobradinho population. We also found COI haplotypes and ML genotypes unique to South American populations, demonstrating a bridgehead effect likely caused by local mutation, adaptation, and admixture patterns that are maintained by high levels of gene flow among them. However, two genetic barriers were also detected. We concluded that L. fortunei is a well-established invader and is still rapidly expanding in Brazil, and the Amazon hydrographic basin is under an alarming threat of invasion.

T1  - Bioaccumulation and toxic potencies of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in freshwater biota from the Ogbese River, Nigeria
AN  - 2473218783
AB  - Samples of fish and shellfish (periwinkles, mussel, and snail) collected from the rapidly contaminated Ogbese River, Ondo State, Nigeria, were analyzed for their polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) levels by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry after cleanup using solid-phase extraction. The rank order of concentration of ΣPAHs in fish follows: gills >> eggs >>> muscle. The dry weight concentrations (μg/g) of total PAHs ranged from < 0.001 to 2.06, 0.01 to 18.67, 0.01 to 9.56, and 0.01 to 8.28 in fish muscle, periwinkle, snail, and mussel respectively. Accumulation levels of PAHs in the biota were used to calculate biota–sediment (or porewater) accumulation factors (BSAF (BPwAF)) and bioaccumulation factor (BAF). The lower molecular weight PAHs constitute major components (≥ 87% in each case) of PAH congener profiles. Bioaccumulation was greatest for PAHs with log Kow values between 5.0 and 5.6. However, the study did not show a good correlation between log Kow of individual PAH and the corresponding BSAFs/BPwAF for the biota. The study indicates that significantly greater (p < 0.05) BSAFs for ΣPAHs were observed in the three bottom dwellers than in fish muscle which suggests that the sediment-feeding behavior largely affected the extent of PAH bioaccumulation in the aquatic organisms. The calculated potency equivalent concentration (PEC) of total PAHs was above the recommended screening value (SV) in US EPA guidelines, suggesting great concern for human consumption. However, estimated excess cancer risk (ECR) induced by dietary exposure only suggests potential cancer risk. The study suggests urgent remediation of the river to safeguard public health.

T1  - Effects of Diclofenac on the embryonic development of freshwater crayfish
AN  - 2623485258
AB  - In recent years, there has been increasing concern about the ecotoxicological consequences of the drug Diclofenac on freshwater organisms. Influences on the largest freshwater invertebrates, the freshwater crayfish, are especially interesting in the context of cascading effects due to their important role as keystone species. In this study, lethality, influences on body weight, embryonic development and histological changes in embryos of marbled crayfish (Procambarus virginalis) as well as noble crayfish (Astacus astacus) were investigated in response to their exposure to different concentrations of Diclofenac. Additionally, the suitability of marbled crayfish as a model organism for endemic freshwater crayfish was established when studying the effects of Diclofenac. For both species, lethal effects started at concentrations of 10.24 mg/L Diclofenac, weight was not affected, embryonic development slowed down from concentrations of 0.16 mg/L and histological changes were visible from concentrations of 0.64 mg/L. The similarity of LOEC (Lowest Observed Effect Concentrations) between the two species showed that marbled crayfish can serve as a model for native crayfish when investigating the effects of exposure to Diclofenac.

T1  - Evidence of a Dietary Shift in Female Barbour's Map Turtle (Graptemys barbouri) to Exploit an Exotic Mollusk
AN  - 2477277507
AB  - Barbour's map turtle (Graptemys barbouri) is the species of map turtle with the highest degree of sexual dimorphism, with females attaining larger body sizes and having much greater head widths than males. Accordingly, females and males also feed on different riverine prey, with females historically feeding on native gastropods and bivalves and males predominantly feeding on soft-bodied macroinvertebrates. Here, we report on a diet shift in female Barbour's map turtle from native prey to an invasive mollusk, the Asian clam (Corbicula fluminea), in southwestern Georgia.

T1  - An assessment of the potential impacts of climate change on freshwater habitats and biota of Indiana, USA
AN  - 2474980868
AB  - Recent climate-driven, physico-chemical changes documented in aquatic systems throughout the world are expected to intensify in the future. Specifically, changes in key environmental attributes of aquatic systems, such as water quantity, clarity, temperatures, ice cover, seasonal flow regimes, external loading, and oxygen content, will undoubtedly have a broad set of direct and indirect ecological consequences. Some anticipated impacts may be similar across different aquatic ecosystems, while others may be system-specific. Here, we review the potential effects of climatic changes for different freshwater habitats within the state of Indiana, USA, a Midwestern state with diverse land and water features. Given this heterogeneity and that the state is among the southernmost states of the US Midwest, evaluation of freshwater habitats of Indiana provides a useful perspective on potential impacts of climate change. In our study, we first review expected or anticipated changes to physico-chemical and habitat conditions in wetlands, lotic systems, small glacial lakes and Lake Michigan. We then highlight anticipated responses of select aquatic biota to these changes. We describe how climatic changes may interact with other anthropogenic stressors affecting freshwater habitats and consider the potential for evolutionary adaptation of freshwater aquatic organisms to mediate any responses. Given anticipated changes, we suggest aquatic ecosystem managers take a precautionary approach broadly applicable in temperate regions to (a) conserve a diversity of aquatic habitats, (b) enhance species diversity and both inter- and intra-population genetic variation, and (c) limit stressors which may exacerbate the risk of decline for aquatic biota.

T1  - Mitigating eutrophication nuisance: in-lake measures are becoming inevitable in eutrophic waters in the Netherlands
AN  - 2473387740
AB  - In the Netherlands, legacies and diffuse nutrient pollution continue to fuel recurrent cyanobacterial blooms in mostly shallow and relatively small surface waters. A survey in peer-reviewed literature and Dutch grey-literature was performed to gain insight into the physical-, chemical- and biological in-lake interventions used to bring these waters towards their desired state. A critical overview is presented on efficacy of different measures to counteract cyanobacterial blooms directly via targeting the cyanobacteria or indirectly via reduction of nutrient availability. Many actions have no or limited effects on minimising cyanobacterial blooms (air-bubble- or oil screens, surface mixers, low-energy ultrasound, effective micro-organisms, fish introduction), while others are more effective, but may vary in longevity and costs (dams, excavation or dredging, hydrogen peroxide, phosphorus inactivation agents), meet legislation restrictions (copper-based algaecides, herbicides, dreissenids), or are not currently implemented (hypolimnetic withdrawal). The selection of promising interventions requires a proper diagnosis of each problem lake, based on water- and nutrient fluxes, the biology of the lake (plants, fish), the function of the lake and the characteristics of the method, such as efficacy, costs, safety and ease of implementation. In the Netherlands, ongoing diffuse loads and legacies necessitate repetitive in-lake interventions.

T1  - Mitigating eutrophication and toxic cyanobacterial blooms in large lakes: The evolution of a dual nutrient (N and P) reduction paradigm
AN  - 2473386543
AB  - Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CyanoHABs) are an increasingly common feature of large, eutrophic lakes. Non-N2-fixing CyanoHABs (e.g., Microcystis) appear to be proliferating relative to N2-fixing CyanoHABs in systems receiving increasing nutrient loads. This shift reflects increasing external nitrogen (N) inputs, and a > 50-year legacy of excessive phosphorus (P) and N loading. Phosphorus is effectively retained in legacy-impacted systems, while N may be retained or lost to the atmosphere in gaseous forms (e.g., N2, NH3, N2O). Biological control on N inputs versus outputs, or the balance between N2 fixation versus denitrification, favors the latter, especially in lakes undergoing accelerating eutrophication, although denitrification removal efficiency is inhibited by increasing external N loads. Phytoplankton in eutrophic lakes have become more responsive to N inputs relative to P, despite sustained increases in N loading. From a nutrient management perspective, this suggests a need to change the freshwater nutrient limitation and input reduction paradigms; a shift from an exclusive focus on P limitation to a dual N and P co-limitation and management strategy. The recent proliferation of toxic non-N2-fixing CyanoHABs, and ever-increasing N and P legacy stores, argues for such a strategy if we are to mitigate eutrophication and CyanoHAB expansion globally.

T1  - Decades needed for ecosystem components to respond to a sharp and drastic phosphorus load reduction
AN  - 2473384002
AB  - Lake Tegel is an extreme case of restoration: inflow treatment reduced its main external phosphorus (TP) load 40-fold, sharply focused in time, and low-P water flushed the lake volume ≈ 4 times per year. We analysed 35 years of data for the time TP concentrations took to decline from ≈ 700 to 20–30 µg/l, biota to respond and cyanobacteria to become negligible. The internal load proved of minor relevance. After 10 years, TP reached 35–40 µg/l, phytoplankton biomass abruptly declined by 50% and cyanobacteria no longer dominated; yet 10 years later at TP < 20–30 µg/l they were below quantifiable levels. 20–25 years after load reduction, the lake was stably mesotrophic, macrophytes had returned down to 6–8 m, and vivianite now forms, binding P insolubly in the sediment. Bottom-up control of phytoplankton through TP proved decisive. Five intermittent years with a higher external P load caused some ‘re-eutrophication’, delaying recovery by 5 years. While some restoration responses required undercutting thresholds, particularly that of phytoplankton biomass to TP, resilience and hysteresis proved irrelevant. Future research needs to focus on the littoral zone, and for predicting time spans for recovery more generally, meta-analyses should address P load reduction in combination with flushing rates.

T1  - Mercury exposure in songbird communities along an elevational gradient on Whiteface Mountain, Adirondack Park (New York, USA)
AN  - 2471635492
AB  - Mercury (Hg) is a potent neurotoxin that biomagnifies within food webs. Adverse effects have been documented for avian species related to exposure of elevated Hg levels. High elevation, boreal forests generally receive higher atmospheric Hg deposition and regional studies have subsequently identified elevated blood Hg concentrations in songbird species inhabiting these montane habitats. The overall goal of this study was to investigate spatial and seasonal Hg exposure patterns in songbird species along an elevational gradient on Whiteface Mountain in the Adirondack Park of New York State. Songbird blood samples were collected from June–July in 2009 and 2010 along an elevational gradient at 13 study plots (450–1400 m) with a focus on Catharus thrushes, including the hermit thrush, Swainson’s thrush, and Bicknell’s thrush. The main results of this study documented: (1) an overall linear pattern of increasing blood Hg concentrations with increasing elevation, with additional analysis suggesting a nonlinear elevational pattern of increasing blood Hg concentrations to 1075 m, followed by decreasing concentrations thereafter, for all Catharus thrush species across the elevational gradient; and (2) an overall nonlinear seasonal pattern of increasing, followed by decreasing blood Hg concentrations across target species. Avian exposure patterns appear driven by elevated atmospheric Hg deposition and increased methylmercury bioavailability within high elevation habitats as compared with low elevation forests. Seasonal patterns are likely influenced by a combination of complex and dynamic variables related to dietary selection and annual molting cycles. Considering that few high elevation analyses have been conducted within the context of regional songbird research, this project complements the results from similar studies and highlights the need for further monitoring efforts to investigate environmental Hg contamination within avian communities.

T1  - Mercury concentrations in fish and invertebrates of the Finger Lakes in central New York, USA
AN  - 2471635011
AB  - Deleterious health effects in humans and wildlife are associated with the consumption of fish contaminated by mercury (Hg). This study was conducted to assess Hg concentrations in biota of the Finger Lakes (New York, USA), a region where fisheries are important for the economy but where no assessment of the drivers of food web Hg dynamics exists to date. Additionally, this region is of interest for the study of Hg bioaccumulation because of the importance of agricultural land cover, which can affect lake trophic status and thus the bioavailability of methyl Hg (MeHg). The study objectives were to (1) assess if fish Hg concentrations were of concern to humans and wildlife, (2) determine if differences in biota Hg concentrations exist among lakes, and (3) assess models developed for New York State as predictors of present day Finger Lakes fish Hg concentrations. Exploratory analyses were also conducted to assess predictors of fish Hg concentrations using lower trophic level MeHg concentrations, water quality, and lake and land cover characteristics. Fish concentrations were above the EPA criterion (300 ng/g wet weight, ww) in 24% of fish, but only Walleye (Sander vitreus) from Owasco Lake exceeded New York State Department of Health consumption guidelines (1000 ng/g ww). The threshold indicating biological changes within fish (500 ng/g ww) was exceeded in 11% of the individuals sampled. Significant differences were found among lakes for all fish species except Largemouth Bass (Micropterus salmoides). Notably, Lake Trout (Salvelinus namaycush) had significantly lower Hg concentrations in Cayuga Lake compared to other Finger Lakes. This trend was not mirrored in the lower food web, as benthic invertebrates had higher MeHg concentrations in Cayuga Lake. Using models developed for New York State in 2003–2005, observed concentrations in 90% of fish were different (±200 ng/g ww) than expected. Findings from this study suggest Hg dynamics in the Finger Lakes require consideration of fish age, growth rates, and food web structure to accurately predict fish Hg concentrations among lakes.

T1  - Mercury exposure in songbird communities within <i>Sphagnum</i> bog and upland forest ecosystems in the Adirondack Park (New York, USA)
AN  - 2471634994
AB  - Mercury (Hg) is a potent neurotoxin that biomagnifies within both aquatic and terrestrial food webs resulting in adverse physiological and reproductive effects on impacted wildlife populations, including songbird communities. Due to reducing conditions, wetland ecosystems promote the formation of methylmercury. Regional studies have documented elevated blood mercury concentrations in songbird species within these habitat types. The overall goal of this research was to examine spatial and seasonal patterns of Hg exposure for targeted songbird species within Sphagnum bog wetland systems and compare these patterns with adjacent upland forests in the Adirondack Park of New York State. Project sampling was conducted at study plots within four Sphagnum bog and associated upland forest sites from May - August during the 2008, 2009, and 2011 field seasons. The overall results documented: (1) blood Hg concentrations were elevated in songbird species inhabiting Sphagnum bog habitats as compared to nearby upland forest species; (2) target species within each habitat type exhibited consistent species-level patterns in blood Hg concentrations at each study site; and (3) no seasonal change in blood Hg concentrations within Sphagnum bog habitats was documented, but an increasing, followed by a decreasing seasonal pattern in mercury exposure was detected for upland forest species. Habitat type was demonstrated to influence avian Hg exposure levels. Moreover, Sphagnum bog ecosystems may be contributing to elevated Hg concentrations in biota within the surrounding environment. Seasonal patterns for blood Hg concentrations were found to vary between habitat type and are likely related to a combination of variables including habitat-driven Hg concentrations in prey items, seasonal dietary shifts, and annual molting cycles. This project emphasizes the importance of prioritizing future research efforts within identified high Hg habitat types, specifically wetland systems, to better characterize associated avian exposure levels, estimate the spatial extent of wetland systems on the surrounding environment, and identify locations of potential biological hotspots across the Adirondack Park.

T1  - Mercury in the fish of New Yorkʼs Great Lakes: A quarter century of near stability
AN  - 2471634001
AB  - We collected 849 fish of 16 species from New York portions of Lake Erie, Lake Ontario and the intervening Niagara River and its tributary Cayuga Creek, and analyzed fillets from individual fish for total mercury. Concentrations ranged from 0.029 to 1.090 ppm wet weight, with 92% below the EPA tissue residue criterion of 0.3 ppm, and thus not posing an undue risk from human consumption. We compared these 2010–2017 results to historical data spanning 40 years to assess temporal changes. The temporal pattern was generally consistent among water bodies and species: Mercury concentrations differed little between the most recent collections and fish taken from 1999–2008 and 1988–1996, while concentrations in all three of these periods were generally lower than in 1970. Smallmouth Bass from Lake Ontario were an exception with a continued decline, likely due to diet change following the introduction of exotic prey. Overall, though, fish tissue mercury concentrations from these large water bodies, which integrate regional influences, appear to have changed little in the last quarter century. We also report a consistent spatial pattern for multiple species having lower mercury concentrations in Lake Erie than in Lake Ontario over the period of record.

T1  - An assessment of temporal trends in mercury concentrations in fish
AN  - 2471633959
AB  - The importance of fish consumption as the primary pathway of human exposure to mercury and the establishment of fish consumption advisories to protect human health have led to large fish tissue monitoring programs worldwide. Data on fish tissue mercury concentrations collected by state, tribal, and provincial governments via contaminant monitoring programs have been compiled into large data bases by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Great Lakes National Monitoring Program Office (GLNPO), the Ontario Ministry of the Environment’s Fish Contaminants Monitoring and Surveillance Program (FMSP), and many others. These data have been used by a wide range of governmental and academic investigators worldwide to examine long-term and recent trends in fish tissue mercury concentrations. The largest component of the trend literature is for North American freshwater species important in recreational fisheries. This review of temporal trends in fish tissue mercury concentrations focused on published results from freshwater fisheries of North America as well as marine fisheries worldwide. Trends in fish tissue mercury concentrations in North American lakes with marked overall decreases were reported over the period 1972–2016. These trends are consistent with reported mercury emission declines as well as trends in wet deposition across the U.S. and Canada. More recently, a leveling-off in the rate of decreases or increases in fish tissue mercury concentrations has been reported. Increased emissions of mercury from global sources beginning between 1990 and 1995, despite a decrease in North American emissions, have been advanced as an explanation for the observed changes in fish tissue trends. In addition to increased atmospheric deposition, the other factors identified to explain the observed mercury increases in the affected fish species include a systematic shift in the food-web structure with the introduction of non-native species, creating a new or expanding role for sediments as a net source for mercury. The influences of climate change have also been identified as contributing factors, including considerations such as increases in temperature (resulting in metabolic changes and higher uptake rates of methylmercury), increased rainfall intensity and runoff (hydrologic export of organic matter carrying HgII from watersheds to surface water), and water level fluctuations that alter either the methylation of mercury or the mobilization of monomethylmercury. The primary source of mercury exposure in the human diet in North America is from the commercial fish and seafood market which is dominated (>90%) by marine species. However, very little information is available on mercury trends in marine fisheries. Most of the data used in the published marine trend studies are assembled from earlier reports. The data collection efforts are generally intermittent, and the spatial and fish-size distribution of the target species vary widely. As a result, convincing evidence for the existence of fish tissue mercury trends in marine fish is generally lacking. However, there is some evidence from sampling of large, long-lived commercially-important fish showing both lower mercury concentrations in the North Atlantic in response to reduced anthropogenic mercury emission rates in North America and increases in fish tissue mercury concentrations over time in the North Pacific in response to increased mercury loading.

T1  - Mercury in fish from streams and rivers in New York State: Spatial patterns, temporal changes, and environmental drivers
AN  - 2471633887
AB  - Mercury (Hg) concentrations in freshwater fish across the state of New York frequently exceed guidelines considered harmful to humans and wildlife, but statewide distribution and temporal changes are not well known for the state’s streams and rivers. We analyzed existing data to describe recent spatial patterns, identify key environmental drivers, and assess temporal changes. Size classes within sportfishes and prey fishes formed ‘functional taxa’ (FT), and standardized scores were generated from 2007–2016 data for 218 sites. Muscle Hg in ≥1 sportfish FT exceeded human-health guidelines of 50 ng/g (sensitive populations) and 300 ng/g (general population, GP) at 93 and 56% of sites, respectively, but exceeded 1000 ng/g (a state threshold) at only 10% of sites. Whole-body Hg in ≥1 prey fish FT exceeded wildlife thresholds of 40 ng/g and 100 ng/g at 91 and 51% of sites, respectively. Environmental drivers of recent spatial patterns include extent of forest cover and storage, the latter an indicator of wetlands. Standardized Hg scores increased with increasing atmospheric Hg deposition and storage across rural ‘upland’ regions of New York. However, scores were not related to atmospheric deposition in more-developed ‘lowland’ regions due to the limited methylation potential of urban landscapes. Comparisons of 2010–2015 sportfish Hg concentrations with those of 1998 and 2000–2005 showed inconsistent temporal changes both among and within eight sites examined. Some recent stream and river fish Hg spatial patterns differed from those of lake-based studies, highlighting the importance of New York’s flowing waters to future Hg monitoring and risk assessment.

T1  - Clearance rates of freshwater bivalves <i>Corbicula fluminea</i> and <i>Utterbackia imbecillis</i> in the presence and absence of light
AN  - 2471471125
AB  - Light affects bivalve behavior and gaping activity, but its potential effects on bivalve filtration remain poorly investigated. In this study, clearance rates of two bivalve species: the Asian clam, Corbicula fluminea and the paper pondshell, Utterbackia imbecillis, were assessed in light (6.5 ± 0.5 µmol m−2 s−1) and dark (0.0 µmol m−2 s−1) conditions. We found that clearance rates remained similar between C. fluminea (50 ± 18 mL g−1 h−1) and U. imbecillis (41 ± 10 mL g−1 h−1) during light conditions. However, C. fluminea (110 ± 15 mL g−1 h−1) filtered significantly faster than U. imbecillis (24 ± 6 mL g−1 h−1) in the dark condition (p < 0.05). The results indicated that light might affect the filtration activity in freshwater bivalves differently, depending on species.

T1  - Detecting a spreading non-indigenous species using multiple methodologies
AN  - 2466209969
AB  - Johansson ML, Lavigne SY, Ramcharan CW, Heath DD, MacIsaac HJ. Detecting a spreading non-indigenous species using multiple methodologies. Lake Reserv Manage. 36:432–443. Non-indigenous species (NIS) are often introduced to novel environments at very low population abundance. Detecting the presence of such an NIS can be very challenging, particularly as it spreads from the initial establishment site. This provides an opportunity to test detection limits using different approaches. This study tested the detection capability of 3 methods as zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) spread from south to north through Lake Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Zebra mussel veliger larvae were detected using cross-polarized light microscopy (CPLM), flow cytometry and microscopy (FlowCam), and conventional polymerase chain reaction (cPCR) analysis of environmental DNA (eDNA) on the same samples. Abundance generally declined from south to north in the lake but was lowest at Calder’s Dock (central). Although abundances could be quite low (i.e., <1 veliger/m3, Calder’s Dock) CPLM prevalence—the percentage of samples with at least one veliger—was high throughout the lake (99–100% of samples). Prevalence was lower for cPCR and FlowCam but was statistically associated with veliger abundance. Using standardized 3 mL subsamples (0.06–0.18 m3 of lake water sampled), all 3 methods had a high probability of veliger detection if large numbers of samples were processed. FlowCam was the most expensive method to process these 3 mL subsamples, while cPCR was least expensive and fastest. eDNA combined with intensive sampling is the most practical method for wide-scale monitoring programs for early detection. However, all 3 methods are complementary and could be deployed sequentially, with rapid initial sample processing using PCR, confirmation and density estimation with FlowCam, and detailed veliger counts using CPLM.

T1  - Megafauna in Salt Marshes
AN  - 2460181735
AB  - Megafauna shape ecosystems globally through trophic interactions, ecology of fear, and ecosystem engineering. Highly productive salt marshes at the interface of terrestrial and marine systems have the potential to support megafauna species, but a recent global meta-analysis of consumer-plant interactions in marshes found few studies investigated impacts of wild megafauna. We conducted a literature review to document the variety of megafauna in salt marshes and found that 34 species utilize salt marshes, including sharks, manatees, pinnipeds, crocodilians, sea otters, hippos, and large terrestrial animals, such as lions, bears and water buffalo. The use of salt marsh habitats by a variety of megafauna may have implications for both the conservation of these large consumers and for the resilience of coastal wetlands through stabilizing feedbacks on plant ecosystems. Future studies should quantify the occurrence and impacts of megafauna in salt marshes, and how their conservation can help restore these valuable ecosystems.

T1  - LAKE HURON IN 2018: AN OVERVIEW 24
AN  - 2717905101
AB  - The fish community of Lake Huron was dominated by invasive species, including Sea Lamprey, Alewife, and Rainbow Smelt. Lake Trout had been extirpated from all but two remote bays while two forms of deepwater ciscoes were extirpated and five others were reduced to a hybrid swarm resulting in a much-reduced commercial and recreational yield. Here, Riley et al discuss the most-recent changes in the ecology of Lake Huron and impacts on fisheries.

AB  - There is no specific fish community objective for lower trophic levels in Lake Huron. Here, Rudstam et al provide a compilation of the information on lower trophic levels with a focus on offshore data for the two most-recent reporting periods (2005-2010 and 2011-2017). They also review the changes that have occurred in the lake since 1983, 1997, or 2001 depending on the variable, and speculate on the changes that have occurred over the past several decades.

T1  - STATUS OF HABITAT IN LAKE HURON IN 2018 22
AN  - 2717889985
AB  - The Lake Huron Environmental Objectives (EOs) and the Lake Huron Biodiversity Conservation Strategy have been helpful in providing a habitat framework, strategy, and actions that are still relevant. More recently, the Lake Huron Lakewide Action and Management Plan (LAMP) updated the status of terrestrial and aquatic habitat and actions necessary to address key environmental threats. The LAMP should be viewed as the principle mechanism for coordinating the implementation strategies to restore habitat in Lake Huron that are being developed by the EO and the Biodiversity Conservation Strategy. Here, Liskauskas et al examine the status of habitat in Lake Huron in 2018.

T1  - Modelling the habitat preferences of the swan mussel (<i>Anodonta cygnea</i>) using data-driven model
AN  - 2473354020
AB  - The Anzali wetland (located in northern Iran) and many parts of its catchment are considered important habitats for the swan mussel (Anodonta cygnea). The habitat of this native bioindicator mussel is being threatened in many locations of the catchment due to various anthropogenic activities. The present study aimed to apply a classification tree model (J48 algorithm) to predict the habitat preferences of A. cygnea in 12 sampling sites based on various water quality and physical-habitat variables. The species was present in 50% of sampling sites, while it was absent in the remaining of the sampling sites. In total, 144 samples of A. cygnea (72 presence and 72 absence instances) were monthly measured together with the abiotic variables during 1-year study period (2017–2018). For the CT model, two-thirds of datasets (96 instances) served as a training and the remainder was employed for the validation set (48 instances). Among 25 environmental variables introduced to the model (with pruning confidence factor = 0.10, threefold cross-validation and 5 times randomization effort), the validity of 6 variables was confirmed by the model in all three subsets. Water salinity, flow velocity, water depth and water turbidity were jointly predicted by the model in three subsets. The model predicted that the absence of A. cygnea might be associated with increasing flow velocity, total phosphate and water turbidity. In contrast, the presence of A. cygnea might be related to decreased water depth and increased calcium concentration. The model also confirmed that all predicted variables for the species might be completely dependent on the water salinity. According to the chi-square test (x2 = 26.53, p < 0.05), the habitat condition of A. cygnea is influenced by significant variations in the spatio-temporal patterns.

T1  - Potential environmental toxicity of sewage effluent with pharmaceuticals
AN  - 2471587473
AB  - Sewage effluent effects on the biochemical parameters of Astyanax bimaculatus organs were investigateted. Treated sewage was collected in a treatment plant; 43 compounds, among them, pharmaceuticals and hormones, were investigated. Caffeine, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, ofloxacin, oxytetracycline, paracetamol, sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole, sulfathiazole and tylosin waste was detected in the collected material. Fish were divided into four groups: control, TSE (treated sewage effluent), TSE + P (TSE with increased concentration of five pharmaceuticals) and PTSE (TSE + P post-treated with O3/H2O2/UV). Biochemical parameters were evaluated in different organs after 14-day exposure. TBARS levels increased significantly in the brain of animals in the TSE and TSE + P groups in comparison to the control. There was significant reduction in TBARS levels recorded for the liver, muscle and gills of animals in the PTSE group in comparison to those of animals in the other groups. AChE activity reduced in the muscle of animals in the groups showing the highest pharmaceutical concentrations. CAT activity in the liver of animals in groups exposed to pharmaceutical effluent was inhibited. GST activity increased in brain of animals in the TSE + P and PTSE groups, whereas reduced levels of this activity were observed in liver of animals in the TSE group. Increased GST activity was observed in the brain of animals in TSE + P and PTSE groups. Based on integrated biomarker response values, the TSE + P group presented greater changes in the analyzed parameters. Results point out that pharmaceutical waste can cause oxidative stress, as well as affect biochemical and enzymatic parameters in Astyanax sp. Post-treatment can also reduce damages caused to fish, even in case of the likely formation of metabolites. Based on these results, these metabolites can be less toxic than the original compounds; however, they were not able to fully degrade the pharmaceutical waste found in the sewage, which can interfere in fish metabolism.

T1  - Combined effects of exposure to sub-lethal concentration of the insecticide chlorpyrifos and the herbicide glyphosate on the biochemical changes in the freshwater crayfish <i>Pontastacus leptodactylus</i>
AN  - 2471586854
AB  - Glyphosate is an herbicide that inhibits the growth of weed plants, while chlorpyrifos is an insecticide commonly applied to control the pests’ population. This study aimed to investigate the combined effects of chlorpyrifos and glyphosate on biochemical, immunological parameters, and oxidative stress biomarkers in freshwater crayfish Pontastacus leptodactylus for 21 days. The experimental design of this study was factorial (3 × 3), including 0.0, 0.4, and 0.8 mg L−1 glyphosate and 0.0, 2.5, and 5 µg L−1 chlorpyrifos. The exposure to chlorpyrifos, glyphosate alone and a mixture of them significantly decreased acetylcholinesterase, alkaline phosphatase, phenoloxidase activities, and total protein levels. The lactate dehydrogenase, glutamic-pyruvic-transaminase, and catalase activities, the contents of glucose, and malondialdehyde levels were increased in the crayfish. No significant changes were detected in glutamic-oxaloacetic-transaminase (SGOT) activity, triglyceride, and total antioxidant (TAO) levels in the crayfish treated with 0.4 mg L−1 glyphosate and the control group. Co-exposure of crayfish to chlorpyrifos and glyphosate increased SGOT activity and TAO levels. Although chlorpyrifos combined with glyphosate decreased the γ-Glutamyltransferase (GGT) activity, the GGT activity was significantly increased in the P. leptodactylus exposed during 21 days to 5 µg L−1 chlorpyrifos alone and 0.8 mg L−1 glyphosate alone. In comparison with the reference group, no significant changes were evidenced in the cholesterol levels in the P. leptodactylus treated with 2.5 µg L−1 chlorpyrifos, but its levels were significantly increased in the other treatment groups. In conclusion, the mix of glyphosate and chlorpyrifos exhibited synergic effects on the different toxicological biomarkers in the narrow-clawed crayfish. Co-exposure to pesticides may result in disruption of homeostasis in the crayfish by altering the biochemical and immunological parameters.

T1  - Evaluation of hemolymph biochemical properties, clearance rate, bacterial microbiota and expression of HSP genes of gulf pearl oyster <i>Pinctada radiata</i> in response to salinity changes
AN  - 2471545038
AB  - Hypo-salinity exposure is a serious concern for bivalve aquaculture, with profound effects on the animals’ physiological condition. The present study aimed to evaluate the influence of low-salinity exposure on the clearance rate, total heterotrophic marine bacteria and total Vibrio count in flesh, as well as the biochemical parameters of hemolymph and heat shock protein (HSP) gene expression, in Pinctada radiata. To this end, the oysters were reared for 14 days at salinities of 40 (control group), 35, 30, 25 and 20 PSU. Results indicated that low salinity led to a significantly lower clearance rate, with the lowest clearance rate observed at 20 PSU. However, no significant differences were found among the groups in the total heterotrophic marine bacteria, calcium concentration, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels. In addition, the results demonstrated that the total Vibrio count increased significantly in oysters exposed to the hypoosmotic condition. A reduction in glucose concentration was observed in the 25 and 20 PSU groups compared to the other experimental groups. In addition, the highest survival rate was found in the 40 and 35 PSU groups. Based on q-RT-PCR results, HSP70 and HSP90 mRNA levels were significantly up-regulated by low-salinity exposure, while the expression of HSP20 mRNA was remarkably down-regulated in the 35 and 30 PSU salinity groups. The present study shows that pearl oysters tolerate a wide range of salinities (40–20 PSU), whereas optimal salinity for oyster culture ranges from 30 to 40 PSU. These results also provide a better understanding of the feeding behavior and physiological changes of P. radiata in response to salinity changes.

T1  - Microplastic Pollution in Deep-Sea Sediments From the Great Australian Bight
AN  - 2448478075
AB  - Interest in understanding the extent of plastic and specifically microplastic pollution has increased on a global scale. Still one large piece of the overall puzzle currently lacks: how much plastic pollution has found its way into the deeper areas of the world’s oceans? The extent of microplastic pollution in deep-sea sediments remains poorly quantified, but this knowledge is imperative for predicting the distribution and potential impacts of global plastic pollution. We quantified microplastics in deep-sea sediments from the Great Australian Bight using an adapted density separation and dye fluorescence technique. We analyzed sediment cores from six locations ranging in ocean depths from 1,655 to 3,062 m and offshore distances ranging from 288 to 356 km from the Australian coastline. Microplastic counts ranged from 0 to 13.6 fragments g-1 dry sediment (mean of 1.26 ± 0.68; n = 51). We found higher microplastic counts than recorded in other microplastic analyses of deep-sea sediments. Sample fragments were identified as polyisoprene, polyurethane, polyester, and polypropylene. A statistical analysis detected a relationship between sediment microplastic counts and the amount of plastic floating on the ocean surface above, as well as with the angle of the seafloor slope. The number of microplastic fragments in the sediment increased as surface plastic counts increased, and as the seafloor slope angle increased. Overall, however, the microplastic counts were highly variable, with variation between sediment cores at the same location being greater than the variation across the sampling sites. Our findings of microplastics in deep-sea sediment from the Great Australian Bight contributes to understanding where some of the ‘hidden’ oceanic plastic pollution is distributed.

T1  - FISH COMMUNITY OBJECTIVES FOR THE LAKE ERIE BASIN
AN  - 2486868513
AB  - Herein, the Lake Erie Committee (LEC) of the Great Lakes Fishery Commission presents its goal, vision, mission, and objectives for the fish community of the Lake Erie basin (i.e., Lake St. Clair, Lake Erie, and associated connecting waters). This document updates the LEC's original goals and objectives from 2003 informed by periodic assessments of progress toward achievement. The new goal and vision re-affirm the commitments of fishery-management agencies from Michigan, New York, Ohio, Ontario, and Pennsylvania to cooperatively attain shared objectives that support fish communities and desired fisheries of societal benefit and a healthy ecosystem in accordance with A Joint Strategic Plan for Management of Great Lakes Fisheries (Joint Plan) (GLFC 2007). The mission advocates the use of the best available science to make decisions and inform fishery management by these five agencies following tenets of the Joint Plan and eleven guiding principles, including support from key partner and stakeholder groups. Presented are eleven fish community objectives with their associated targets that guide LEC decisions involving intensively managed species (fish populations that support broadly distributed fisheries and the invasive Sea Lamprey) (Table 1), other managed species (fish populations that support localized fisheries), rehabilitation species (important species that lack self-sustaining populations), and prey fish (largely unfished and unmanaged populations of ecological importance to the fish community). Measures to facilitate evaluation of progress for each objective every five years through state-of-the-lake conferences and reports are identified. The fish community objectives in this document explicitly focus on species that contribute to a functional food web for a healthy and resilient Lake Erie ecosystem and that sustain desired fisheries.

T1  - Eutrophication and water quality policy discourse in Lake Erie Basin
AN  - 2451134419
AB  - Watershed-based approaches to addressing water quality issues often involve a diverse set of actors working collaboratively to develop policy. Such an approach is currently underway in the Western Lake Erie Basin, where the province of Ontario and the state of Ohio have embarked on a 40% phosphorus run-off reduction target to address eutrophication problems in the lake. In this study, we adopt the concept of discourse to inform our understanding of the collaborative process undertaken to develop domestic action plans (DAPs) to guide efforts by various stakeholders. We find that in both cases there were distinct groups of actors who shared and promoted a particular narrative or storyline. These storylines provided varying accounts of the science and policy aspects of the eutrophication problem in Lake Erie, and there was variation as well in the specific actors to whom they attributed responsibility. We illustrate how the storylines shaped the nature and form of the action plans. We provide a discussion of the policy implications of unequal capacities among different actor coalitions to influence trajectories and outcomes in the context of governance for water quality. It is shown that the potential of discourse coalitions to influence policy raises important questions as to whose voice is considered legitimate enough to be included in the policy process.

T1  - Invasive coral <i>Tubastraea</i> spp. population growth in artificial habitats and its consequences to the diversity of benthic organisms
AN  - 2427188307
AB  - Marinas create physical and biotic conditions distinct from those in natural habitats which can facilitate the establishment of non-indigenous species (NIS) in coastal ecosystems. Using a series of images spanning nine years, we detected the introduction and followed the expansion of the NIS Tubastraea coccinea and T. tagusensis populations at a recreational marina in a region of Southeastern Brazil where sun-corals are rarely found on natural substrates. Because sun corals are known to reduce diversity in natural invaded environments, we evaluated how different densities of sun-corals affected the benthic community. Overall, the NIS populations have grown exponentially from 2010 to 2019 inside the marina, occupying up to 60% of the available space. However, the population growth in the breakwater stopped in 2016. Local variation in the population growth across the marina might be associated with the high phytoplankton biomass and larval retention inside the marina, which are results of the lower hydrodynamics. The expansion of sun-coral coverage did not significantly affect the richness of benthic communities but was associated with a reduction of the native bryozoan Amathia brasiliensis, the overall abundance of mobile crustaceans, and an increase in the area covered by the exotic bryozoan S. errata. The fast substitution of a native ecosystem engineer for a NIS suggests signs of invasion meltdown associated with the expansion of Tubastraea spp.

T1  - Trophic ecology and metabolism of two species of nonnative freshwater stingray (Chondrichthyes: Potamotrygonidae)
AN  - 2411432226
AB  - The stingrays Potamotrygon amandae and Potamotrygon falkneri are nonnative species established in the Upper Paraná basin. Although they are widely distributed, few studies on their diets or respective metabolic responses exist. Therefore, the aim was to evaluate the dietary composition, trophic niche breadth and lipid/protein concentrations in muscle and hepatic tissues of these two species, as well as the interrelationships between them. The individuals were collected in two areas on the Upper Paraná River. The stomachs and samples of muscle and liver tissues were taken for analysis. A broad dietary spectrum was observed for both species, along with differences in dietary composition, with a higher consumption of detritus by P. amandae and Baetidae by P. falkneri. No differences were observed in the trophic niche breadth. Regarding the metabolic variables, differences were only found in the hepatic protein, with a higher content observed in P. falkneri. A significant positive correlation was observed between items of animal origin and detritus with muscle protein for this species. This shows that such feeding habits, which are characteristic of a generalist, influenced the metabolism of the species and possibly contributed to the successful adjustment of the species to new habitats in the Upper Paraná River.

T1  - Modelling risks posed by wind turbines and power lines to soaring birds: the black stork (<i>Ciconia nigra</i>) in Italy as a case study
AN  - 2384692381
AB  - Recent growth of investments in wind energy and power industries has increased concerns about the associated adverse impacts on wildlife. In particular, flying vertebrates are especially at risk, both directly, through an extra mortality rate due to collision with turbines and electrocution, and indirectly through habitat loss or fragmentation. In this study, we propose a modelling approach that combines species distribution models and data managed in geographic information systems to predict and quantify the effects of wind turbines and power lines on the breeding habitat of a soaring migratory bird, the black stork Ciconia nigra, in Italy. The species is recolonizing the country, where it had been driven to extinction in the Middle Age by human persecution. Today, infrastructures such as those considered in our study might in fact hamper this recolonization. Our results show a high probability of presence of the species in several areas in Italy. The most important variables in influencing habitat suitability for C. nigra are the mean temperature of May followed by the distance from urban areas, inland wetlands and hydrographic network. Exposure to wind turbine collision and electrocution resulted to be potentially high. In particular, in Northern Italy the main potential risk of mortality for C. nigra is posed by power lines, whereas in southern regions the species might be mostly threatened by wind turbines. Our approach makes it possible to detect suitable areas that, although not yet colonized by the species, would imply a high mortality risk should the species colonize them in the future. The tool we provide may therefore prove useful to conservationists and landscape planners in order to mitigate the impact of human infrastructures on this species and encourage a more sustainable planning.

T1  - Better off dead: assessment of aquatic disinfectants and thermal shock treatments to prevent the spread of invasive freshwater bivalves
AN  - 2402242155
AB  - Biosecurity protocols designed to prevent further spread of invasive alien species have become a key component of invader management strategies. Yet, the species-specific efficacy of many biosecurity treatments are frequently unclear or unknown. Invasive quagga, Dreissena bugensis, and zebra mussels, D. polymorpha, are a serious threat to freshwater ecosystems worldwide. Here, we examine the effectiveness of immersion (≤ 90 min) within 2% or 4% solutions for two commonly used disinfectants (Virasure® Aquatic and Virkon® Aquatic) to cause mortality of adult Dreissena bivalves. Further, we assessed the effectiveness of thermal treatments: steam spray (≥ 100 °C; ≤ 120 s); hot air (− 500 °C; ≤ 60 s); and dry ice exposure (− 78 °C; ≤ 300 g; 15 min). Complete mortality of D. polymorpha was observed following exposure to both disinfectants for 90 min, at both concentrations. However, high but incomplete mortality (40–90%) was recorded for D. bugensis across disinfectant treatments. For both species, complete mortality was achieved following 30 s of steam. In addition, 10 s of hot air and 15 min exposure to 300 g of dry ice can both completely killed groups of D. polymorpha. Overall, although the disinfectants did not cause complete mortality, it appears that relatively brief exposure to thermal treatments could be used to curtail the further spread of Dreissena species.

T1  - Invasion impacts on functions and services of aquatic ecosystems
AN  - 2377707509
AB  - Non-native species can simultaneously affect ecological structures, functions, and services of the invaded ecosystem. In this paper, we report that the study of non-native species impacts on ecosystem function is an emerging topic in aquatic ecology, though studies measuring functions remain relatively uncommon. We hypothesized that study of ecosystem function can reveal emergent effects of non-native species when community structure appears to be unimpacted and the study of multiple functions has the potential to identify impacts masked by food-web complexity. We compiled information from Web of Science to create a pool of papers (n = 199) addressing ecosystem functions and services that we surveyed to evaluate our hypotheses. The number of publications referencing ecosystem function has increased since 2002, but only 10% of papers measured ecosystem functions as defined in our work. Additionally, 80% of publications reporting functional metrics addressed primary production and nutrient fluxes, while a low number of manuscripts (6%) directly linked the impact of non-native species on ecosystem functions to ecosystem services. We recommend future work focus on less-studied functions (e.g., bioturbation, decay rate, biomagnification), assess multiple functional metrics, link functions to services, and use networks to understand impacts from multiple dimensions of an invaders ecology.

T1  - Paleo-environmental evidence of ecosystem change in Lake St. Clair region of Laurentian Great Lakes basin: contrasting responses to land-use change and invasive mussels
AN  - 2352895230
AB  - The Laurentian Great Lakes have been subject to substantial modification from diverse anthropogenic stressors, including nutrient enrichment, climate change, chemical and biological pollutants, and invasive species, yet little is known of the relative historical influence of these factors. Here we analyze diverse fossil metrics from vibracores at two sites, a bay area (Anchor Bay) and a tributary (Clinton River) in the Lake St. Clair ecosystem to determine the ecological responses from land-use practices and invasive mussel invasions. Sediment cores spanning over 100 years indicated that the expansion of non-native Dreissena polymorpha and Dreissena rostriformis (dreissenid mussels) into Anchor Bay site after the mid-1990s was associated with ~ 60 to 95% reduction in algal and cyanobacterial abundances and twofold increase in sedimentary organic matter (SOM) and bioavailable phosphorus. These increases in SOM and bioavailable phosphorus are relatively similar to increases inferred from the late nineteenth century when large portions of the watershed were cleared and drained for agriculture. In contrast, the Clinton River site experienced a continuous increase in the influx of nutrients, organic matter, and elevated sedimentary phototrophic pigments during the twentieth century and into the twenty-first century. Site comparisons suggest different mechanisms inducing changes in primary production varied, where Anchor Bay was mainly affected by the comparatively recent (since ca. mid-1990s) endogenous influence of invasive species, while the Clinton River site was primarily influenced by the input of exogenous anthropogenic nutrients over the past 100 years. These new findings illustrate that watershed management and policies within large lakes with multi-jurisdictional (national) Area of Concerns should consider site-specific regulatory mechanisms.

T1  - Carbon and nitrogen recycling during cyanoHABs in dreissenid-invaded and non-invaded US midwestern lakes and reservoirs
AN  - 2343255113
AB  - Lakes and reservoirs play key roles in global carbon cycling, especially as a carbon sink. Enrichment of nutrients in lakes and reservoirs (eutrophication) and rising global temperatures favors the proliferation of bloom-forming cyanobacteria. Harmful blooms of cyanobacteria (cyanoHABs) alter carbon and nutrient cycling in freshwater ecosystems. Some evidence suggests the introduction or establishment of invasive mussel species (i.e., Dreissena spp.) also favor cyanoHAB formation through selective filter feeding, a process through which they may also impact biogeochemical processes including carbon cycling and sequestration. However, few studies have considered the combined effects of invasive mussels and cyanoHABs on carbon and nitrogen cycling in freshwater ecosystems. Here, we examined microbial community composition and biogeochemical attributes (including carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes) in eutrophic lakes, reservoirs, and rivers in western Ohio, eastern Indiana, and northern Kentucky during the cyanobacterial bloom period of the summer of 2015. Our samples include both sites impacted by invasive mussels and those where invasive mussels have not yet been observed. Based on 16S and 18S rRNA gene sequence analysis, we found that cyanobacterial and algal communities varied across sites and were most closely related to habitat (sediment or water column sample) and site, regardless of the presence of invasive mussels or other environmental factors. However, we did find evidence that invasive mussels may influence both carbon and nitrogen cycling. While the results are based on a single time point sampling, they highlight the interactions of multiple environmental stressors in aquatic ecosystems and the critical need for more temporally intensive studies of carbon and nutrient cycling in bloom- and mussel-impacted waters.

T1  - On the environmental background of aquatic organisms for ecological niche modeling: a call for caution
AN  - 2263020570
AB  - Ecological niche modeling (ENM) is a technique widely used in many disciplines of science. Recently, the extent of using the environmental background for ENM calibration has been pointed out as playing a crucial role in determining model outcomes. However, when modeling freshwater species, the need for a background refinement has been ignored and its consideration possesses important implications not taken into account before. Here, using Maxent algorithm and global occurrence data characterizing the distribution of the invasive freshwater turtle, Trachemys scripta, we performed ENM transfer and compared native and invasive niche estimates for the species in the environmental space. We used two environmental backgrounds: (a) a traditional area, based on the current distribution and dispersal capacity of the species, and (b) a more restricted area, which corresponds exclusively to freshwater bodies. Our analysis revealed strong differences between the traditional and the restricted backgrounds in niche transferability, with differences in Maxent probability values ranging from − 0.59 to 0.41. Also, during comparisons between native and invasive niches, the niches were more similar when the traditional approach was used, compared to the restricted approach. Our results highlight the importance of considering the biological restriction of the species when establishing the extent of the background in ecological niche modeling; in this case, a more restricted area represented by freshwater environments.

T1  - Rethinking restoration targets for American chestnut using species distribution modeling
AN  - 2250841025
AB  - Given the scale and speed of contemporary environmental changes, intensive conservation interventions are increasingly being proposed that would assist the evolution of adaptive traits in threatened species. The ambition of these projects is tempered by a number of concerns, including the potential maladaptation of manipulated organisms for contemporary and future climatic conditions in their historical ranges. Following the guidelines of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, we use a species distribution model (SDM) to consider the potential impact of climate change on the distribution and quantity of suitable habitat for American chestnut (Castanea dentata), a functionally extinct forest species that has been the focus of various restoration efforts for over 100 years. Consistent with other SDMs for North American trees, our model shows contraction of climatically suitable habitat for American chestnut within the species’ historical range and the expansion of climatically suitable habitat in regions to the north of it by 2080. These broad changes have significant implications for restoration practice. In particular, they highlight the importance of germplasm conservation, local adaptation, and addressing knowledge gaps about the interspecific interactions of American chestnut. More generally, this model demonstrates that the goals of assisted evolution projects, which often aim to maintain species in their native ranges, need to account for the uncertainty and novelty of future environmental conditions.

T1  - Ecological-social-economic assessment of zebra-mussel cultivation scenarios for the Oder (Szczecin) Lagoon
AN  - 2100938064
AB  - The Systems Approach Framework with an integrated Ecological-Social-Economic assessment was applied to address the issue of zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) farming in the large Oder (Szczecin) Lagoon, southern Baltic Sea. Heavy eutrophication hampers the use of the lagoon and zebra mussel farming is considered as new use and potential measure to improve water quality. Three alternative scenarios were developed in interaction with local stakeholders: 1) the production of mussels as fresh feed and meal on a commercial basis seemed not profitable, because of a limited market for fresh mussels (zoos, aquaculture) and low prices for organic feed. 2) Mussel cultivation to improve transparency and attractiveness of bathing waters near beaches had only a limited potential (0.2 m improvement of Secchi depth). A higher mussel biomass would increase the risk of temporary hypoxia. 3) Mussels farms for improving the environmental status (according to EU Water Framework Directive) by supporting macrophyte restoration were considered as the most promising scenario. Our model simulations suggested that as soon as a compensation for nutrient removal is considered, all mussel farm scenarios could cover the costs. Experiments and literature confirm that the conditions for an environmental friendly farming approach in the lagoon are suitable. Steps towards and problems associated with an implementation, e.g. invasion of Dreissena bugensis (quagga mussel), are discussed. Each step of the Ecological-Social-Economic assessment and major lessons learnt are documented in detail. Altogether, the approach turned out to be very suitable for this issue.

AB  - The objective of the study was to define the primary environmental factors affecting the composition of the macrobenthic community in an abandoned open cast sulphur mine pit lake that had been filled with water from a nearby river. We investigated habitats at various depths and the macrobenthic communities; samples were collected by scuba divers. Although rush and submerged vegetation in the subsaline pit lake was abundant and provided potentially good habitat conditions for mayflies, caddisflies, coleopterans, or damselflies, the native insects were scarce. The taxa do not have many representatives in waters with elevated salinity, so those present in the Machów pit lake were mainly euryhaline species. Chironomids were the most abundant macroinvertebrates in shallower zones, whereas non-native zebra mussels were the quantitatively dominant taxon in deep-water zones. Moreover, these non-native mussels were the dominant biomass of invertebrates at all sites in all seasons. The current composition of the invertebrate assemblage was probably primarily determined by the salinated water, which limited the abundance of native species and gave non-native species an edge.Alternate abstract:Ziel der Untersuchung war die Definition primärer Umweltfaktoren die die Zusammensetzung der makrobenthischen Gemeinschaft in einem Bergbaufolgesee eines aufgegebenen Schwefeltagbaus, der mit Wasser aus einem nahegelegenen Fluß aufgefüllt worden ist. Wir untersuchten Lebensräume in unterschiedlichen Tiefen und die makrobenthischen Gemeinschaften. Proben wurden von zertifizierten Tauchern gezogen. Obwohl die üppige Ufer- und Unterwasservegetation im Brackwasser des Bergbaufolgesees einen potentiell günstigen Lebensraum für Eintagsfliegen, Köcherfliegen, Käfer oder Libellen gewährleistet, waren heimischen Insekten selten. Das biologische System hat nicht viele Vertreter in Wasser mit erhöhtem Salzgehalt, die im Machówer Bergbaufolgesee sind hauptsächlich Euryhaline-Arten. Chironomidenlarven sind die, in den seichteren Zonen überwiegend vorhandenen Wirbellosen, während die nicht heimische Zebramuschel die mengenmäßig dominante biologische Gruppe im Tiefwasserbereich darstellt. Zudem stellt diese nicht heimische Muschel überall und zu allen Jahreszeiten den dominaten Anteil des wirbellosen Biomassebestands. Die aktuelle Zusammensetzung der wirbellosen Gruppe war möglicherweise primär vom Brackwasser bestimmt, welches den bodenständigen Artenreichtum begrenzt und nicht heimischen Arten bevorzugt.Alternate abstract:El objetivo del estudio fue definir los principales factores ambientales que afectan la composición de la comunidad macrobentónica de un lago en el hoyo de una mina de azufre a cielo abierto abandonada que se había llenado con agua de un río cercano.

Aunque la vegetación sumergida en el lago subsalino era abundante y proporcionaba condiciones de hábitat potencialmente buenas para las efímeras, los tricópteros, los coleópteros o las damiselas, los insectos nativos eran escasos. Los taxones no tienen muchos representantes en aguas con salinidad elevada, por lo que los que se encuentran en el lago Machów fueron principalmente especies de Eurihalina. Los quironómidos fueron los macroinvertebrados más abundantes en las zonas menos profundas, mientras que los mejillones cebra no nativos fueron el taxón cuantitativamente dominante en las zonas de aguas profundas. Además, estos mejillones no nativos fueron la biomasa dominante de invertebrados en todos los sitios en todas las estaciones. La composición actual del conjunto de invertebrados probablemente fue principalmente determinada por el agua salina que limitó la abundancia de especies nativas y dio una ventaja a las especies no nativas.Alternate abstract:抽象露天硫磺矿矿坑湖由周边河水汇入而成。研究旨在确定影响矿坑湖大型底栖生物群落组成的主要环境因素。研究了不同深度的生境和大型底栖生物群落;样本由潜水员采集; 虽然半咸矿坑湖丰富的草丛和淹没植为蜉蝣、毛翅蝇、鞘翅目昆虫和豆娘(一种蜻蜓)提供了良好的潜在栖息环境,但本地昆虫物种很少。高盐度水域没有太多代表性类群,因而Machów 矿坑湖主要为广盐类物种。摇蚊是浅水区数量最多的大型无脊椎动物,非本地斑马贝是深水区数量占优的类群。这些非本地贻贝在整个季节和所有地点组成无脊椎动物的优势生物量。目前,无脊椎动物组成主要由湖水碱度决定;限制了本地物种数量,同时也使非本地物种占一定优势。

T1  - Biological effects of water velocity and other hydrodynamic characteristics of flow on dreissenid mussels
AN  - 2227634705
AB  - The invasion of dreissenid mussels into inland waters of the Northern Hemisphere has received considerable attention and, both zebra mussels and quagga mussels continue to spread westward. Despite studies aimed at understanding the biology of dreissenid mussels, relatively few studies have focused on water velocity and other hydrodynamic characteristics of water flow. The objective of this review was to identify, through a search of online databases, the papers that have been made available that directly have assessed the influence of hydrodynamic characteristics of water flow on dreissenid mussel biology. Using Thompson Reuters Web of Science, Google Scholar, and other resources, 46 papers were identified. These papers detailed that metrics associated with hydrodynamics of water flow, including current, wave action, velocity, flow rate, and discharge, can influence the biology of dreissenid mussels (primarily zebra mussel, which were studied far more than quagga mussel). Hydrodynamic characteristics influenced external fertilization, larval development and settlement, juvenile recruitment and attachment, and suspension feeding, growth and abundance of adults. In most cases, the impact of higher flow rates were locally negative and may present an opportunity for applications of water flow to control the spread or establishment of dreissenid mussels. Several knowledge gaps have been identified.

T1  - Two Non-indigenous Dreissenids (Dreissena polymorpha and D. rostriformis bugensis) in a Southern Baltic Coastal Lagoon: Variability in Populations of the “Old” and a “New” Immigrant
AN  - 2308162837
AB  - Dreissena polymorpha and D. rostriformis bugensis are freshwater Ponto-Caspian bivalve species, at present widely distributed in Europe and North America. In the Szczecin Lagoon (a southern Baltic coastal lagoon), the quagga was recorded for the first time in 2014 and found to co-occur with the zebra mussel, a long-time resident of the Lagoon. As the two species are suspected of being competitors where they co-occur, their population dynamics was followed at a site the new immigrant was discovered (station ZS6, northern part of the Lagoon) by collecting monthly samples in 2015-2017. The abundance and biomass of the two congeners showed wide fluctuations, significant differences being recorded between months within a year and between years. The abundance and biomass proportions between the two congeners changed from an initial domination of the newcomer quagga until mid-2015 to a persistent domination of the zebra mussel throughout the remainder of the study period. Both the abundance and biomass of the two dreissenids showed a number of significant associations with environmental variables, notably with salinity, chlorophyll a content, and temperature. The co-occurrence of the two dreissenids in the Lagoon is discussed in the context of their invasion stage; it is concluded that while the quagga seems to have achieved the “outbreak” stage, the zebra mussel, an “accommodated” invader present prior to the quagga immigration, reverted to that stage.

T1  - Estimate zebra mussel veliger density from the riverbanks, lotic stretch and reservoir, in two Mediterranean rivers (E Spain)
AN  - 2582791523
AB  - Larval detection is the most commonly used procedure for monitoring the presence of Zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorha. Different filtering techniques carried out on the banks of the Ebro (EB) and Júcar (JU) rivers (Eastern Spain) in different water conditions are compared. Low volume water filtration from the banks is a method sensitive enough to detect variations in larval density due to water temperature and flow rates. The EB densities were lower and related to the temperature of the water. In JU, different spawning strategies and a much extended period of larval releasing into the water occurred in two consecutive years. The presence of larvae in both rivers was constant for many months of the year, during which various reproductive cycles occurred, facilitated by high water temperatures during mid-spring to late fall. Shoreline surveys can be easily used for allowing the early warning of the presence of this dangerous invasive species, mitigating damages and preventing its spread into new areas. However, it is important to choose a suitable location for capturing the larvae on the banks of reservoirs and in flowing rivers.Alternate abstract: La détection larvaire est la procédure la plus couramment utilisée pour surveiller la présence de la moule zébrée, Dreissena polymorha. Différentes techniques de filtrage réalisées sur les rives de l'Èbre et du Júcar (Est de l'Espagne) dans différentes conditions de rivière et d'eau stagnante (réservoirs) sont comparées. La filtration de l'eau à faible volume à partir des berges est une méthode suffisamment sensible pour détecter les variations de densité larvaire dues à la température de l'eau et aux débits. La présence de larves dans les deux rivières a été constante pendant de nombreux mois de l'année, au cours desquels divers cycles de reproduction se sont produits, facilités par les températures élevées de l'eau du milieu du printemps à la fin de l'automne. Les relevés littoraux peuvent être facilement utilisés pour permettre l'alerte précoce de la présence de cette espèce envahissante dangereuse, atténuant ainsi les dommages et empêchant sa propagation dans de nouvelles zones. Cependant, il est important de choisir un endroit approprié pour capturer les larves sur les rives des réservoirs et dans les cours d'eau.

T1  - Distribution and recent status of freshwater mussels of family Unionidae (Bivalvia) in the Czech Republic
AN  - 2582791414
AB  - This study is devoted mainly to the distribution and its changes, inhabited and preferable habitats of bivalves from family Unionidae in the territory of the Czech Republic and the discussion of major threats and conservation measures. Altogether 6 autochthonous (Unio crassus, Unio pictorum, Unio tumidus, Anodonta anatina, Anodonta cygnea, Pseudanodonta complanata) and 1 allochthonous species (Sinanodonta woodiana) has been known in the Czech Republic. All these species occurred in all three river basins (Labe, Odra, Danube) and watersheds (North, Baltic and Black seas). A. anatina is the most widespread and common unionid while P. complanata is an autochthonous bivalve with the most restricted area of distribution. U. crassus has been a significantly disappearing species. As in most European countries, pollution and habitat loss including fragmentation and degradation, together with other factors such as water abstraction, invasive species and loss of fish hosts are the main threats affecting their populations.Alternate abstract: Cette étude est principalement consacrée à la répartition et à ses changements, aux habitats occupés et préférés des bivalves de la famille des Unionidae sur le territoire de la République Tchèque et à la discussion des principales menaces et mesures de conservation. Au total, 6 espèces autochtones (Unio crassus, Unio pictorum, Unio tumidus, Anodonta anatina, Anodonta cygnea, Pseudanodonta complanata) et 1'espèce allochtone (Sinanodonta woodiana) sont connues en République Tchèque. Toutes ces espèces étaient présentes dans les trois bassins hydrographiques (Labe, Odra, Danube) et bassins versants (Mer du Nord, Mer Baltique et Mer Noire). A. anatina est l'unionidé le plus répandu et le plus commun tandis que P. complanata est un bivalve autochtone dont la répartition est la plus restreinte. U. crassus est une espèce en voie de disparition. Comme dans la plupart des pays européens, la pollution et la perte d'habitat, y compris la fragmentation et la dégradation, ainsi que d'autres facteurs tels que les prélèvements d'eau, les espèces envahissantes et la perte de poissons hôtes sont les principales menaces qui pèsent sur leurs populations.

T1  - Analysis of Macrobenthic Communities in a Post-Mining Sulphur Pit Lake (Poland)
AN  - 2278090886
AB  - The objective of the study was to define the primary environmental factors affecting the composition of the macrobenthic community in an abandoned open cast sulphur mine pit lake that had been filled with water from a nearby river. We investigated habitats at various depths and the macrobenthic communities; samples were collected by scuba divers. Although rush and submerged vegetation in the subsaline pit lake was abundant and provided potentially good habitat conditions for mayflies, caddisflies, coleopterans, or damselflies, the native insects were scarce. The taxa do not have many representatives in waters with elevated salinity, so those present in the Machów pit lake were mainly euryhaline species. Chironomids were the most abundant macroinvertebrates in shallower zones, whereas non-native zebra mussels were the quantitatively dominant taxon in deep-water zones. Moreover, these non-native mussels were the dominant biomass of invertebrates at all sites in all seasons. The current composition of the invertebrate assemblage was probably primarily determined by the salinated water, which limited the abundance of native species and gave non-native species an edge.

T1  - Erodibility and transport behavior of dreissenid mussel deposits in an annular flume
AN  - 2041056585
AB  - PurposeZebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) alter the transport dynamics and fate of particulate matter in aquatic systems by intercepting, retaining, and recycling suspended materials. This study examines the effect of particle processing by dressenids on the nature (grain size distribution, settling velocity, porosity  and density) and transport properties (critical shear stress for erosion, erosion rates, and bed stability) of suspended particulate matter in lakes.Materials and methodsThe bed stability, erosion rate, and critical shear stress for erosion of dreissenid biodeposits were measured in an annular flume. The particle size distribution, settling rate, density, and porosity were measured to characterize the physical nature of the biodeposits. Materials studied in the flume include (1) a combination of biodeposits and surface sediments collected from dreissenid beds and (2) biodeposits harvested in a weir box populated with dreissenids.Results and discussionThe settling rates of both biodeposit/sediment mixtures and pure biodeposits were lower than natural sediment in lacustrine environments. Erosion characteristics and transport properties of biodeposits were strongly influenced by bed age and the presence of mussels. Bed stability increased after 7 days, with a τcrit of 0.26 Pa compared to the 2- and 14-day consolidation periods (τcrit = 0.13 and 0.15 Pa), respectively. The observed changes in bed stability with bed age will modify the transfer of particulate materials to the offshore profundal zone as well as the rates and magnitudes of sediment-associated nutrients in the near shore zone.ConclusionsBiostabilization of surficial lake-bottom sediments impacted by mussel biodeposits may increase bed stability and reduce the export of particulate matter to the offshore environment. Further, well-developed communities of dreissedid mussels have an armoring effect on deposited sediment, which reduces remobilization of sediment and biodeposits. However, once eroded, the dreissedid modified deposits will likely be transported further due to their low-settling velocity.

T1  - Effects of zebra mussels on cladoceran communities under eutrophic conditions
AN  - 2063107209
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine how zebra mussels affected cladoceran community structure under eutrophic conditions. We conducted a mesocosm study where we manipulated the presence of zebra mussels and the presence of large-bodied Daphnia (Daphnia magna and Daphnia pulicaria). We also conducted a complimentary life-table experiment to determine how water from the zebra mussel treatment affected the life history characteristics of the cladoceran species. We anticipated that small- and large-bodied cladoceran species would respond differently to changes in algal quality and quantity under the effects of zebra mussels. Large-bodied Daphnia successfully established in the zebra mussel treatment but failed to grow in the control. We did not observe positive relationships between food concentrations and cladoceran abundances. However, the phosphorus content in the seston indicated that food quality was below the threshold level for large-bodied cladocerans at the beginning of the experiment. We believe that zebra mussels quickly enhanced the phosphorus content in the seston due to the excretion of inorganic phosphorus, thus facilitating the development of large-bodied Daphnia. In conclusion, our results suggest that zebra mussels can alter the phosphorus content of seston in lakes and this can affect the dynamics of crustacean zooplankton.

T1  - The food web positioning and trophic niche of the non-indigenous round goby: a comparison between two Baltic Sea populations
AN  - 2048816388
AB  - The food web positioning of the non-native round goby (Neogobius melanostomus Pallas, 1814) was studied in a new invasive population in Mariehamn, Åland Islands (northern Baltic Sea). The trophic position and isotopic niche space was compared to other benthic-feeding fish species in the same habitat. The trophic position (TP) was estimated based on stable isotope analysis of carbon (13C:12C) and nitrogen (15N:14N) ratios and compared to that of an established invasive population in Hel, Gulf of Gdansk (southern Baltic Sea). Ontogenetic changes in isotope signatures were evaluated with a regression analysis and compared between the two populations. The round goby positioned as a second-order consumer on the third trophic level among other benthic-feeding fish. It showed a similar trophic position and significant isotopic niche overlap with large perch. The trophic position of round gobies in Mariehamn is significantly higher than in Hel, likely due to different prey items. Furthermore, the ontogenetic patterns differ between the two invasive populations, also suggesting differing resource and habitat availability and levels of intraspecific competition between areas.

T1  - Long-term trends in seasonal plankton dynamics in Lake Mead (Nevada-Arizona, USA) and implications for climate change
AN  - 2036586332
AB  - Over the past few decades, Lake Mead (Nevada-Arizona, USA) has experienced multiple ecosystem stressors including drought, increased water demand, and establishment of invasive species (quagga mussels, gizzard shad). Despite these potential stressors, zooplankton and phytoplankton community dynamics in the pelagic regions of Lake Mead have generally followed consistent seasonal patterns. Long-term monitoring results (2007–2015) show that zooplankton and phytoplankton communities remain relatively stable in Lake Mead on an inter-annual basis, but are susceptible to shifts caused by extreme climate fluctuations and alterations in mixing regimes. A warm winter characterized by low snowpack in 2014/2015 preceded a large bloom of toxic cyanobacteria (Microcystis aeruginosa Kützing) in Las Vegas Bay the following summer. Large bloom events are rare in Lake Mead; however, under future climate scenarios, these types of events may become more frequent. Because of the consistency of plankton community dynamics over an extended period of time, Lake Mead offers an ideal system for the study of future climate change impacts. This study aims to characterize the response of plankton communities in Lake Mead to both linear and dynamic environmental changes.

T1  - Cyanobacteria reduce quagga mussel (<i>Dreissena rostriformis bugensis</i>) spawning and fertilization success
AN  - 2407606413
AB  - Quagga mussels (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) are highly fecund broadcast spawners invasive to freshwaters of North America and western Europe. We hypothesized that environmental cues from phytoplankton can trigger gamete release in quagga mussels. Nutritious algae may stimulate dreissenid spawning, but less palatable food, such as bloom-forming cyanobacteria, could be a hindrance. The objective of our study was to test whether exposure to cyanobacteria can inhibit quagga mussel spawning and fertilization. We assessed spawning in the presence of serotonin, a known spawning inducer, where adult quagga mussels placed in individual vials were exposed to 13 cyanobacteria cultures and purified algal toxin (microcystin-LR) with artificial lake water as the control. Fertilization success was evaluated by combining eggs with sperm in conjunction with cyanobacteria, and enumerating zygote formation marked by cellular cleavage. Several cyanobacterial strains reduced spawning and fertilization success, but microcystin-LR had no effect. Fertilization was more sensitive to cyanobacteria than gamete release. Only 1 culture, Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, inhibited spawning, whereas 6 cultures consisting of Anabaena flos-aquae, Dolichospermum lemmermanii, Gloeotrichia echinulata, Lyngbya wollei, and 2 Microcystis aeruginosa isolates reduced fertilization rates by up to 44%. The effects of cyanobacteria on reproduction in invasive freshwater mussels in the wild have not yet been identified. However, our laboratory studies show that concentrations of cyanobacteria that are possible during bloom conditions probably limit reproduction. Reproductive consequences on wild populations may become more prevalent as cyanobacteria blooms occur earlier in the year, making overlap between blooms and mussel spawning more common. Describing the mechanism by which cyanobacteria inhibit spawning and fertilization could reveal novel control methods to limit reproduction of this invasive species.

T1  - Western Painted Turtles (Chrysemys picta bellii) in a Highly Urbanized System: Unexpected Variation in Resource Use Among Age Classes and Sexes
AN  - 2109283603
AB  - Understanding patterns of resource use is an important aspect of the conservation and management of animal populations. We used stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen from nail samples of Western Painted Turtles (Chrysemys picta bellii) to examine isotopic niches for individuals in an urban population. Western Painted Turtles are omnivorous, so we predicted that there would be little isotopic niche variation by sex, location, or age class. In contrast to our prediction, isotopic niche size varied up to three times among groups; females inhabiting marsh habitat had the largest niche, whereas females inhabiting creek habitat had the smallest. Isotopic niches overlapped 26-77%, with the least overlap between adult males and females, indicating niche partitioning by sex. Body size and location also contributed to the diversity of resource use. Isotopic mixing models indicated that all turtles consumed low proportions of a variety of prey items, but there were differences among groups. Turtles inhabiting creek habitat consumed higher proportions of chironomid larvae, whereas those in marsh habitat consumed higher proportions of crayfish and amphipods. Our findings indicate that urban turtles take advantage of a wide range of prey, and that aquatic systems with high productivity and diversity are well suited for maintaining turtle populations.

T1  - Transmission and terrestrial dispersal of non-native ectosymbionts on invasive crayfish
AN  - 2041231492
AB  - Symbionts are a fundamental component of biological systems, and their survival is highly dependent on transmission and host movement. Ectosymbionts of amphibious animals face the added challenge of having to survive dramatic environmental changes as their hosts cross ecosystem boundaries. Within freshwaters, crayfish are amongst the most widespread invasive species that readily disperse overland and are host to a wide range of ectosymbionts. Relatively little is known about the transmission of these ectosymbionts, including their ability to survive overland host migration. Here, we assessed terrestrial emigration and both inter- and intra-specific transmissions of Xironogiton victoriensis, a non-native branchiobdellidan (Annelida: Clitellata) recently found on invasive signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) in the UK. These branchiobdellidans tolerated desiccation and did not alter host terrestrial behaviour. Transmission was rapid between natural signal and novel virile (Orconectes cf. virilis) crayfish hosts, with host interactions facilitating transmission. Thus, branchiobdellidans can disperse via amphibious host behaviour and readily infect novel hosts. These traits facilitate symbionts’ survival and provide access to additional dispersal pathways that are likely to aid transmission.

T1  - Niche differentiation among invasive Ponto-Caspian <i>Chelicorophium</i> species (Crustacea, Amphipoda, Corophiidae) by food particle size
AN  - 2022073926
AB  - After Chelicorophium curvispinum, two other Ponto-Caspian tube-dwelling, filter-feeding amphipod species (Chelicorophium robustum and Chelicorophium sowinskyi) have colonized several catchments in Central and Western Europe in recent decades. To reveal the mechanism of niche differentiation among them, we measured the mesh sizes of their filtering apparatus and analyzed multi-habitat sampling data from the River Danube using RDA-based variance partitioning between environmental and spatial explanatory variables. Morphometric data showed a clear differentiation among the species by filter mesh size (C. curvispinum > C. robustum > C. sowinskyi). Field data also indicated the relevance of suspended matter; however, the mere quantity of suspended solids included in the analysis could not explain the abundance patterns effectively. Current velocity, substrate types, and total nitrogen content also had a non-negligible effect; however, their role in the niche differentiation of the species is not evident. In summary, differences in their filter mesh sizes indicate a niche differentiation by food particle size among the invasive Chelicorophium species, allowing their stable coexistence given sufficient size variability in their food source. Consequently, the two recent invaders increase the effectiveness of resource utilization, resulting in a more intensive benthic–pelagic coupling in the colonized ecosystems.

T1  - Ignoring seasonal changes in the ecological niche of non-migratory species may lead to biases in potential distribution models: lessons from bats
AN  - 2024667745
AB  - Phenology is a key feature in the description of species niches to capture seasonality in resource use and climate requirements. Species distribution models (SDMs) are widespread tools to evaluate a species’ potential distribution and identify its large-scale habitat preferences. Despite its chief importance, data phenology is often neglected in SDM development. Non-migratory bats of temperate regions are good model species to test the effect of data seasonality on SDM outputs because of their different roosting preferences between hibernation and reproduction. We hypothesized that (1) the output of SDMs developed for six non-migratory European bat species will differ between hibernation and reproduction; (2) models built from datasets encompassing both ecological stages will perform better than seasonal models. We employed a dataset of 470 independent occurrences of bat hibernacula and 400 independent records of nursery roosts of selected species and for each species we developed separate winter, summer and mixed (i.e. generated from both winter and summer occurrences) models. Seasonal and mixed potential ranges differed from each other and the direction of this difference was species-specific. Mixed models outperformed seasonal models in representing species niches. Our work highlights the importance of considering data seasonality in the development of SDMs for bats as well as many other organisms, including non-migratory species, otherwise the analysis will lead to significant biases whose consequences for conservation planning and landscape management may be detrimental.

T1  - Pathways and places associated with nonindigenous aquatic species introductions in the Laurentian Great Lakes
AN  - 2009849277
AB  - Propagule pressure (i.e., the frequency and abundance of introductions) is a common indicator of the likelihood of nonindigenous aquatic species (NAS) establishment success. Evaluating propagule pressure associated with multiple introduction pathways relative to present NAS distribution patterns may identify which pathway presents the greatest risk. Our objective was to develop and evaluate three geospatial metrics for the Laurentian Great Lakes as proxies of propagule pressure associated with three major introduction pathways: maritime commerce, organisms in trade, and water recreation. Logistic and linear regression analyses were conducted between NAS presence and introduction pathway intensity (e.g., number of vessel trips received by a port) for 23 NAS over a five-decade period (1970–2013). Notably, city population size was the best predictor of NAS presence, even for NAS introduced through ballast water discharge. Moreover, through time, city population size was an increasingly significant predictor of the presence of organisms in trade, signaling a change in both the types of organisms introduced and places where introductions are occurring. Nonetheless, all three metrics are reasonable proxies for propagule pressure and as such are applicable for risk assessment, monitoring, and control strategies.

T1  - The invasive potential of tilapias (Osteichthyes, Cichlidae) in the Americas
AN  - 1979063513
AB  - The invasion of tilapia can result in substantial impacts on native communities. Thus, understanding the spatial dynamics of invasions may help prevent future introductions and mitigate impacts. This study estimated the environmentally suitable areas for occurrence of eight tilapia species (genera Coptodon, Oreochromis, Pelmatolapia, and Sarotherodon) in the Americas and their invasive potential using Ecological Niche Models (ENMs). The United States is the most invaded country, receiving all tilapia species. In South America, the southeast and south regions of Brazil are highlighted as the areas where two species are concentrated. The ENMs predicted that all tilapia species have high invasive potential in the Americas, and despite having more tilapias in North America, South and Central Americas are more susceptible to tilapia invasion. All South American basins were predicted to harbor tilapia species that have not yet arrived on the subcontinent. Our study evidences the need to implement management measures and governmental policies in the Americas to deal with problems caused by tilapia introductions. In North America, the focus is on the control of tilapia populations and in Central and South America priority should be given to contention of introduction processes.

T1  - Non-native species in reservoirs: how are we doing in Brazil?
AN  - 1969424265
AB  - The Brazilian Environmental Ministry (MMA) released a report in 2016 listing 163 non-native species into Brazilian inland waters. Reservoirs are among the freshwater habitats most frequently associated with the release of non-native species. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the occurrence and distribution of the non-native species listed by the MMA, in large Brazilian reservoirs (≥ 30 km2). Further, we have tested the hypothesis that beta diversity of non-native species within reservoirs from the same basin is lower than those among reservoirs from distinct basins. A literature search was performed for 70 Brazilian reservoirs, resulting in the records of 91 non-native species. Reservoirs from the Paraná basin showed the highest number of occurrences, with 33 non-native species recorded only in the Itaipu reservoir. Beta diversity of non-native species showed higher variability among reservoirs from different basins than those within the same basin. Some basins were also distinguished by their composition of non-native species, as supported by the IndVal index. Non-native species were widespread along Brazilian reservoirs, and their distribution can be even higher than reported.

T1  - Regulation of plankton and nutrient dynamics by profundal quagga mussels in Lake Michigan: a one-dimensional model
AN  - 2006662885
AB  - Invasive dreissenid mussels have altered plankton abundance and nutrient cycling in the Great Lakes. In this study, a 1-D hydrodynamic-biogeochemical coupled model is developed to investigate their effects at a mid-depth offshore site in Lake Michigan. Model simulation shows that water surface temperature and vertical thermal structure can be well reproduced. Driven by the simulated vertical mixing, the biological model solves the transport and transformation of nutrients, plankton and detritus in the water column. Mussel grazing and excretion are added at the bottom boundary. The biological model predicts a notable decline of phytoplankton biomass and considerable increase of dissolved phosphorus (DP) in the entire water column at the end of spring. However, the reduction of phytoplankton and the increase of DP are limited to the bottom 20 m in summer as a result of the strong stratification. Model results also show that mussels can maximize particle delivery to the benthos, as the modeled benthic diffusive flux of particulate phosphorus exceeds the passive settling rate by 4.2× on average. Model simulation over a 10-month period indicates that profundal mussels have the potential to significantly change the distribution of energy and nutrients in the water column, even in a deep and stratified environment.

T1  - Feeding patterns of the black-striped pipefish <i>Syngnathus abaster</i> in an invaded freshwater habitat
AN  - 2002589630
AB  - Syngnathus abaster is an euryhaline species, which has penetrated freshwaters in Europe and its range is expanding. The goal was to investigate the feeding patterns of this species in an invaded freshwater habitat, where it first appeared at the beginning of 1990s, with implications for assessing its possible effects on invaded ecosystems. In total, 36 prey items were identified in the diet of S. abaster. The most important prey were zooplanktonic organisms, among which copepods predominated significantly. The second most important prey were cladocerans, represented by 20 species/genera. The diet composition of this species showed clear seasonal dynamics but copepods remained the predominant prey item throughout the year. Significant positive relationships between the abundance of zooplanktonic organisms in the gut contents of S. abaster and their abundance in zooplankton samples were found for copepods and Ceriodaphnia sp. S. abaster showed a significant positive electivity for copepods throughout all months. It also positively selected some large cladocerans, which probably shared the same habitat. S. abaster also consumed fish items including gobiid larvae and its own juveniles, when they were abundant in May and especially in June. The possible effect of S. abaster on native ecosystems may include the shaping of zooplanktonic communities through selective predation on copepods. This species is unlikely to be a serious food competitor for native fish inhabiting European freshwaters, the majority of which are cyprinids. Nevertheless, it can have effects on some native fish through predation on their juveniles, which might share the same habitats.

T1  - Detachment rates of dreissenid mussels after boat hull-mediated overland dispersal
AN  - 2002400165
AB  - Introductions of the invasive zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) and quagga mussel (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) into hydrologically isolated water bodies have been attributed to overland transport via (recreational) boat hulls. Before a boat becomes a successful vector, mussels must (1) attach to the hull, (2) survive air exposure during overland transport and (3) establish a viable population either after detachment or release of spat during launching or sailing. This study mimics these dispersal barriers and assesses the potential of boat hull-mediated release into a recipient environment for both species. Individuals were allowed to attach to aluminium and fibreglass plates. Hereafter, attached individuals were exposed to air and subsequently submerged again. Zebra mussels had a significantly higher attachment rate than quagga mussels. The percentage of attached dreissenid mussels that detached alive during rewetting ranged between 7.9 and 21.8%. No significant difference was found between species and hull materials. However, alive detachment during rewetting was significantly higher after 24 h compared to 48 h of air exposure. Our data allow modelling introduction pressure of lakes if quantitative data on overland boat movement and the density of attached mussels are available.

T1  - Sonar technology and underwater imagery analysis can enhance invasive <i>Dreissena</i> distribution assessment in large rivers
AN  - 2002400163
AB  - Dreissena spp. are aggressive invaders of many waterbodies worldwide. However, the accurate assessment of their spatial distribution in large rivers is difficult using traditional sampling techniques such as Ponar grabs or SCUBA diving. The aim of this study was to use sonar technologies and underwater imagery (videos, still images) in tandem with traditional Ponar sampling to predict Dreissena presence, and produce a habitat suitability map to enhance our understanding of its spatial distribution in the lower Niagara River, New York, USA. Geo-referenced maps of environmental variables were generated using three sonar technologies: side scan sonar, multibeam sonar, and an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler. Dreissena presence/absence was determined at 102 sites along a 10 km stretch using Ponar grabs supplemented by an underwater imagery. Substrate and near-bottom flow were the most important variables affecting Dreissena distribution. Habitats with coarse substrate and near-bottom flow of 0.6–0.80 m/s were predicted to be most often occupied. The habitat suitability model indicates that almost 90% of the stream bed in the river can be considered highly- or moderately suitable habitat. Our results demonstrate that supplementing traditional sampling with sonar technologies and underwater imagery can greatly improve Dreissena distribution assessment at the ecosystem scale.

T1  - Sedentary prey facing an acute predation risk: testing the hypothesis of inducible metabolite emission suppression in zebra mussels, <i>Dreissena polymorpha</i>
AN  - 2002399933
AB  - It takes time before a defensive phenotype can be effectively developed, which handicaps sessile bivalves exposed to acute predation risks. In a laboratory experiment, we examined whether predation threats induce zebra mussels to limit metabolic rates, serving as a fast-response defence that reduces the chances of chemical detection by predators. We measured the respiration rate of mussels exposed to predation treatments (fish fed zebra mussels, fish fed chironomids, crushed zebra mussels) and to predation-free conditions, and we tested the effect of these treatments on attachment strength and aggregation. Compared with the predation-free controls, all mussels in the predation treatments tended to initially have suppressed metabolic rates. The rate of metabolism increased over time in all treatments, but only in the presence of fish fed chironomids was the increase significantly greater than in the control. Attachment strengths and aggregation rates were similar for all treatments after 7 days. Our results provide the first evidence of predation-induced changes in zebra mussel metabolic rates. We suggest that mussels respond differently to different types of predation threats. Immediately after receiving predation cues, they react promptly by lowering their production of metabolites, but over time, they re-adjust their response to the actual predation threat present.

T1  - Trends in Unionidae (Mollusca, Bivalvia) communities in Romania: an analysis of environmental gradients and temporal changes
AN  - 2002399715
AB  - Freshwaters are among the most imperilled habitats worldwide and Unionidae species are recognised as one of the most important and endangered parts of the communities they shelter. Understanding the changes in the structure of Unionidae communities and their responses to environmental variables are issues insufficiently studied and understood. We evaluated 35 naiad communities along geographical and ecological gradients in Romania, and measured 10 environmental factors at each sampling location. Using constrained ordination analysis, we learned that the most significant variables explaining the variance in species composition were flow, human impact and elevation. Among the levels of the habitat factorial variable the most explicative were the lower Danube habitats, which shelter the richest naiad assemblages. Unionids diversity decreases significantly with increases in elevation and human impact. By comparing some communities with those of two decades ago, a contrasting image emerges. In some rivers where the former heavy pollution has been greatly reduced, the naiads are recovering. However, the average diversity of the communities that we compared is statistically lower at present than two decades ago, indicating that in some areas the ecological state of the freshwater systems is slightly worsening. Main causes are pollution, hydrotechnical constructions, invasive species and climatic changes.

T1  - Predicting habitat suitability for eleven imperiled fluvial freshwater mussels
AN  - 1979063518
AB  - Understanding patterns in freshwater mussel distributions and habitat use, particularly for imperiled species, is critical for their conservation. To aid in management of imperiled mussels, and to demonstrate the utility using both landscape-based and biotic predictors in assessing species habitat suitability, we modeled 11 imperiled mussels in rivers of Michigan, USA. Models were developed with MaxEnt using a combination of host fish richness, natural abiotic reach variables, and landscape-based natural and anthropogenic variables. Because potential host fishes are important biological determinants of mussel distributions, fluvial host fish distributions (n = 37) were modeled and integrated as a predictor in mussel models. Key predictors determining habitat suitability for mussels included host fish richness, a strong positive predictor for 8 of 11 mussel species, stream discharge, urban land use, and upstream dam density. Models predicted 853 to 10,138 stream km of suitable habitat (1.1 to 13.6% of the state’s stream length) for the 11 mussel species, with 54 to 1,382 km (0.1 to 1.8%) being considered highly suitable habitat. Mapping of suitable habitats identified streams with available habitat for multiple listed species, allowing for more informed decisions in conservation planning and management of Michigan’s listed freshwater mussels and their fish hosts.

T1  - Indicators of Ventenata (Ventenata dubia) Invasion in Sagebrush Steppe Rangelands
AN  - 2056018645
AB  - Ventenata [Ventenata dubia (Leers) Coss.], an invasive winter annual grass, significantly reduces forage production in grassland systems and displaces species within both perennialand annual-dominated grasslands within the Inland Northwest. The range of V. dubia is expanding into sagebrush steppe communities, an expansive habitat critical for forage production, wildlife, and recreation. Currently, there is limited knowledge of V. dubia's distribution and abundance within sagebrush steppe communities. We performed field surveys at 15 locations in sagebrush steppe rangelands in southern Idaho and eastern Oregon to assess where V. dubia occurs, with the aim of providing insight about its niche in this new habitat. Specifically, we evaluated biotic and abiotic factors of the plant community as indicators of V. dubia presence. We also correlated species diversity measures with no, low (<12.5%), and high (>12.5%) V. dubia cover. Though widely distributed throughout the study region, V. dubia only appeared in 45% of the 225 plots, and foliar cover was typically less than 50%. It was primarily found in ephemerally wet microhabitats. Species richness and the Shannon diversity index were lowest in plots with high V. dubia cover. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis revealed that V. dubia and medusahead [Taeniatherum caput-medusae (L.) Nevski] were closely associated. Furthermore, chi-square indicator analysis showed that T. caput-medusae was more prevalent, while mountain big sagebrush [Artemisia tridentata Nutt. spp. vaseyana (Rydb.) Beetle] was less prevalent, in plots containing V. dubia. Abiotic factors that explained variation in V. dubia abundance included rock cover, soil depth, and a north/south aspect. Higher V. dubia cover also correlated with higher clay content and lower phosphorus and potassium concentrations in the soil. We suggest that at this point, detection survey efforts to locate incipient infestations of V. dubia in sagebrush steppe communities should focus on moist areas and sites susceptible to invasion by T. caput-medusae.

T1  - Towards a ground pattern reconstruction of bivalve nervous systems: neurogenesis in the zebra mussel <i>Dreissena polymorpha</i>
AN  - 1993165580
AB  - Bivalvia is a taxon of aquatic mollusks that includes clams, oysters, mussels, and scallops. Within heterodont bivalves, Dreissena polymorpha is a small, mytiliform, freshwater mussel that develops indirectly via a planktotrophic veliger larva. Currently, only a few studies on bivalve neurogenesis are available, impeding the reconstruction of a ground pattern in Bivalvia. In order to inject novel data into this discussion, we describe herein the development of the serotonin-like and α-tubulin-like immunoreactive (lir) neuronal components of D. polymorpha from the early trochophore to the late veliger stage. Neurogenesis starts in the early trochophore stage at the apical pole with the appearance of one flask-shaped serotonin-lir cell. When larvae reach the veliger stage, four flask-shaped serotonin-lir cells are present in the apical organ. At the same time, the anlagen of the cerebral ganglia start to form at the base of the apical organ. From the apical organ, one pair of cerebro-visceral connectives projects posteriorly and connects to a posterior larval sensory organ that contains serotonin- and α-tubulin-like flask-shaped cells. Additional, paired serotonin-lir neurites originate from the apical organ and project into the velum. One unpaired stomatogastric serotonin-lir cell develops ventrally to the stomach at the veliger stage. The low number of serotonin-lir cells in the apical organ of bivalve veligers is shared with larvae of basally branching gastropods and scaphopods and is thus considered a feature of the last common ancestor of Conchifera, while the overall simplicity of the larval neural architecture appears to be a specific trait of Bivalvia.

T1  - Effects of turbulence exposure on zebra mussel (<i>Dreissena polymorpha</i>) larval survival
AN  - 1985053023
AB  - To more accurately predict recruitment of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) in waterbodies downstream of a source population, factors that control the successful transport of zebra mussel larvae need to be quantified. Turbulence has been identified in previous studies as a likely factor in larval morality in rivers and streams where turbulent energy dissipation can be orders of magnitude greater than in lakes. To investigate the impact of turbulent energy dissipation on zebra mussel larval mortality, we conducted a series of experiments using lake water collected from Lake Minnetonka, Minnesota containing veligers in a jar test device. Results indicate that zebra mussel larval mortality is a function of veliger size, turbulent energy dissipation, and exposure time. The mortality at 24 h of turbulence exposure was fit to a function of d*, the ratio of shell size to Kolmogorov length scale, to develop a dose–response curve. Mortality rate constants were estimated by fitting mortality data from specified turbulence regimes to a first-order model. The mortality rates ranged from 0.09 to 1.71 day−1 and were correlated to energy dissipation.

T1  - Comments on restricted distribution of <i>Mytilopsis adamsi</i> Morrison, 1946, a non-native false mussel in the Songkhla Lagoon System, southern Thailand
AN  - 1981649659
AB  - The establishment of Mytilopsis adamsi Morrison, 1946 populations in areas around the mouth of the Songkhla Lagoon System, southern Thailand, was first reported in 2008. A recent survey has revealed they now have a wider distribution range. However, this distribution is surprisingly restricted to only within a number of the rivers running into the lower part of the Thale Sap Songkhla Lake, the southernmost part of the system. Moreover, these populations were not found within the lake itself. Effects of the fluctuation in salinity and the local dynamics of water current within the system on the mussels’ ability to disperse as possible causes of restricted distribution are discussed.

T1  - Seasonal effect of zebra mussel colonies on benthic processes in the temperate mesotrophic Plateliai Lake, Lithuania
AN  - 1938800246
AB  - Sparse colonies of zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) create net heterotrophic sediment patches via respiration, excretion, and biodeposition activities, but their effect as biogeochemical hotspots is scarcely investigated in nutrient-limited ecosystems. We analyzed the seasonal effect of zebra mussel colonies on benthic respiration (O2, TCO2, N2, and CH4) and nutrient fluxes (NH4 +, NO
 
   x −
  , SRP, and SiO2) in a macrophyte-dominated mesotrophic temperate lake. Intact sediments with and without zebra mussel aggregates were collected in winter, summer, and autumn, and incubated to measure fluxes. The contribution of mussel colonies alone to benthic metabolism was also quantified. Sediments with mussels always had higher rates of respiration (O2 and TCO2) and nutrient recycling (NH4 + and SRP) as compared to bare sediments, while there was no effect on CH4, NO3 −, and SiO2 fluxes. Mussel colonies stimulated nitrogen removal via denitrification, but only in the summer. The effect of colonies was particularly evident in warmer periods, due to mussel respiration and excretion and to biodeposits that increased microbial activity in sediments. In this mesotrophic lake, mussel aggregates contribute to alleviate nutrient (N and P) limitation, but their heterotrophic activity is likely buffered by nutrient uptake and oxygen production by submersed vegetation.

T1  - ENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTIVES AND HABITAT 8
AN  - 2717341589
AB  - The Lake Erie Committee (LEC) established three fish community objectives that address habitat--nearshore habitat, riverine and estuarine habitat, and fish habitat--and an objective to address contaminants. Through 2004, the LEC addressed Habitat and Contaminant Objectives through position statements; support and participation in initiatives, such as the Lake Erie Lakewide Management Plan; and habitat work by individual member agencies. Here, Gorman and MacDougall discuss the environmental objectives of the LEC.

T1  - Are long-term fish assemblage changes in a large US river related to the Asian Carp invasion? Test of the hostile take-over and opportunistic dispersal hypotheses
AN  - 1910236797
AB  - Gizzard shad is a dominant planktivore/detritivore in the Wabash River, and populations crashed in the early 1990s. Previous work (1974-2008) identified a substantial shift in body-size structure and functional trait composition in the Wabash River fish assemblage between 1989 and 1996. Invasive Asian Carp appeared in the Ohio River basin including the Wabash River in the 1990s. Our goal was to test for temporal changes in assemblage composition and trophic structure relative to the invasion of Asian carp from the early 1990s. We hypothesized that establishment of Asian Carp was a contributor to the assemblage composition shift, and that their presence altered the trophic pathways and food sources of native fishes including Gizzard Shad (hostile takeover hypothesis). Alternatively, Asian Carp may have found success through capitalizing on an empty niche, likely left vacant by the decline in Gizzard Shad, or abundance changes in other trophic groups (opportunistic hypothesis). We utilized archival fish and mussel collections to test for trophic changes in the ecosystem using δ13C and δ15N stable isotope analyses. We examined stomach contents of the dominant planktivore/detritivore consumer, Gizzard Shad, from archival and recent collections to test for changes in the phytoplankton community. Stable isotopes indicated a community reliance on other, more deplete, carbon sources than indicated by the algae, and a slight increase between the δ13C time periods. Although all functional feeding groups of fishes indicated some reduction in δ15N, the differences were only significant for omnivores, mussels, and planktivore/detritivores. Although Asian Carp may have contributed to the collapse of Gizzard Shad populations, other stressors were likely more important drivers of their decline. This is the first, albeit indirect, evidence of opportunistic "invasion" as opposed to the historically presumed hostile takeover model.

T1  - Climate change as a long-term stressor for the fisheries of the Laurentian Great Lakes of North America
AN  - 1910235070
AB  - The Laurentian Great Lakes of North America provide valuable ecosystem services, including fisheries, to the surrounding population. Given the prevalence of other anthropogenic stressors that have historically affected the fisheries of the Great Lakes (e.g., eutrophication, invasive species, overfishing), climate change is often viewed as a long-term stressor and, subsequently, may not always be prioritized by managers and researchers. However, climate change has the potential to negatively affect fish and fisheries in the Great Lakes through its influence on habitat. In this paper, we (1) summarize projected changes in climate and fish habitat in the Great Lakes; (2) summarize fish responses to climate change in the Great Lakes; (3) describe key interactions between climate change and other stressors relevant to Great Lakes fish, and (4) summarize how climate change can be incorporated into fisheries management. In general, fish habitat is projected to be characterized by warmer temperatures throughout the water column, less ice cover, longer periods of stratification, and more frequent and widespread periods of bottom hypoxia in productive areas of the Great Lakes. Based solely on thermal habitat, fish populations theoretically could experience prolonged optimal growth environment within a changing climate, however, models that assess physical habitat influences at specific life stages convey a more complex picture. Looking at specific interactions with other stressors, climate change may exacerbate the negative impacts of both eutrophication and invasive species for fish habitat in the Great Lakes. Although expanding monitoring and research to consider climate change interactions with currently studied stressors, may offer managers the best opportunity to keep the valuable Great Lakes fisheries sustainable, this expansion is globally applicable for large lake ecosystem dealing with multiple stressors in the face of continued human-driven changes.

T1  - The role of environmental factors in the induction of oxidative stress in zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha)
AN  - 1899808738
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of specific environmental factors, such as temperature, pH, oxygen concentration, and phosphate, nitrate, chloride, sodium, potassium, sulphate, magnesium and calcium ions concentration, as well as microcystins, on the seasonal variations in the activity of the antioxidant system of the zebra mussel. We examined changes in lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels, glutathione content and the catalase activity of mussels inhabiting the two ecosystems, which differ due to their trophic structure and the presence of toxic cyanobacteria. The results show a relationship between the activity of the antioxidant system of zebra mussels and the seasonal fluctuations of environmental parameters: the symptoms of oxidative stress were generally the highest during spring and the lowest during summer in both ecosystems. Our study also revealed that regardless of the study area the most important factors determining the activity of the antioxidant defences of mussels were the mineral composition (particularly magnesium and calcium ions concentrations) and physical parameters of the water (oxygen concentration and pH). However, factors resulting from the trophic status of studied ecosystems, such as limitations in food resources or high concentration of microcystins during cyanobacterial blooms, were periodically responsible for increased level of LPO in the tissues of zebra mussel. These findings may indicate a limited tolerance of the zebra mussel to the local environmental conditions.

T1  - No effect of recent sympatry with invasive zebra mussel on the oviposition decisions and reproductive success of the bitterling fish, a brood parasite of unionid mussels
AN  - 1899721095
AB  - The presence of non-native species can affect coevolved relationships. However, rapid reciprocal changes in coevolutionary associations provide the potential to quickly respond to a new situation. We studied a system where bitterling fish (Rhodeus amarus) parasitize unionid mussels by laying their eggs onto their gills. This association is affected by the infestation of unionid shells by the non-native zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha). In a series of experiments under experimental, semi-natural and natural conditions, we compared the behavioural response to zebra mussel infestation of unionid shells, its effect on oviposition decisions and their population consequences between bitterling populations naïve to zebra mussels and those recently sympatric with zebra mussels. We found no effect of recent sympatry on bitterling preoviposition behaviour and oviposition decisions and only a weak effect on their reproductive success. Bitterling from both populations inspected infested and non-infested mussels at the same rate but preferred to oviposit into non-infested unionid hosts. However, neither bitterling population completely avoided oviposition into infested unionids and three ovipositions into zebra mussels were observed. Overall, there was a clear negative relationship between the number of zebra mussels on unionid host shells and the number of juvenile bitterling emerging from the mussels. Our study demonstrated a lack of rapid evolutionary response to adaptively modulate oviposition choice after recent zebra mussel invasion.

T1  - Identifying critical habitat for freshwater turtles: integrating long-term monitoring tools to enhance conservation and management
AN  - 1899695979
AB  - The effective conservation and management of threatened species requires comprehensive knowledge about resource utilisation. Here we integrated tissue stable isotope analysis and biotelemetry to identify the predominant dietary resources of two sympatric species of freshwater turtle, and locate where those items were acquired. We deployed an array of underwater acoustic telemetry receivers to autonomously, simultaneously, and continuously, monitor the movements of the threatened Elseya albagula and Elusor macrurus, over a 12-month period. Stable isotope (SI) values (δ13C and δ15N) were measured within the carapace of each species, and compared with SI values within potential food items. The integration of movement information and carapace SI data revealed that whilst these species had overlapping home ranges, there was less than 5% probability of inter-species dietary niche overlap. E. macrurus acquired food items consisting of bivalves, gastropods and aquatic insects within rocky riffles whilst E. albagula fed on filamentous algae and crustaceans foraged from the muddy and vegetated shallow margins of deep water pools. Our findings differ from stomach content analysis and mark-recapture studies, which reported these species to have similar habitat and resource requirements. We argue that the observed disparity is because our methods provided a weighted measure of an individual's dietary preference and habitat utilisation over a broad time-scale, whilst stomach content analysis and mark-recapture studies offer only a single observation of an individual's dietary preference. The research demonstrates the utility of integrating passive acoustic telemetry and carapace stable isotope analysis for identifying critical habitat for freshwater turtles.

T1  - Zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) affects the feeding ecology of early stage striped bass (Morone saxatilis) in the Hudson River estuary
AN  - 1889309085
AB  - Variability in the feeding ecology of young fishes over short and long time scales in estuaries is likely to affect population dynamics. We studied 14 years of early stage Striped Bass feeding ecology in the Hudson River Estuary over a 25-year time span, including years in which invasive zebra mussels markedly altered energy flow within the estuary. We predicted that feeding success would be low and that diet composition would be altered during years of high zebra mussel impact, particularly in upriver locations where mussels occur. Feeding success in the short term was indicated by volume of gut contents and in the long term by dry mass at length, i.e. condition; these measures were positively intercorrelated and varied significantly year to year. We tested for associations between condition and multiple biotic and abiotic environmental variables. There was a strong negative effect of zebra mussel grazing rate on condition in upriver locations and a weak positive effect in downriver locations. In upriver locations, condition was 33% higher when local salinity was high and zebra mussel grazing rates were low, whereas in downriver locations, condition was 35% higher when zebra mussel grazing rates and copepod abundance were high and local dissolved oxygen was low. Copepods, amphipods, mysids, and Leptodora constituted the highest prey-specific index of relative importance throughout the estuary. There was no evident effect of the zebra mussel invasion on diet composition. This long-term study corroborates the inferences of earlier studies that zebra mussels reduced early-stage striped bass growth rate.

T1  - Early detection monitoring for larval dreissenid mussels: how much plankton sampling is enough?
AN  - 1867930758
AB  - The development of quagga and zebra mussel (dreissenids) monitoring programs in the Pacific Northwest provides a unique opportunity to evaluate a regional invasive species detection effort early in its development. Recent studies suggest that the ecological and economic costs of a dreissenid infestation in the Pacific Northwest of the USA would be significant. Consequently, efforts are underway to monitor for the presence of dreissenids. However, assessments of whether these efforts provide for early detection are lacking. We use information collected from 2012 to 2014 to characterize the development of larval dreissenid monitoring programs in the states of Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington in the context of introduction and establishment risk. We also estimate the effort needed for high-probability detection of rare planktonic taxa in four Columbia and Snake River reservoirs and assess whether the current level of effort provides for early detection. We found that the effort expended to monitor for dreissenid mussels increased substantially from 2012 to 2014, that efforts were distributed across risk categories ranging from high to very low, and that substantial gaps in our knowledge of both introduction and establishment risk exist. The estimated volume of filtered water required to fully census planktonic taxa or to provide high-probability detection of rare taxa was high for the four reservoirs examined. We conclude that the current level of effort expended does not provide for high-probability detection of larval dreissenids or other planktonic taxa when they are rare in these reservoirs. We discuss options to improve early detection capabilities.

T1  - Zoochorous dispersal of freshwater bivalves: an overlooked vector in biological invasions?
AN  - 2056757019
AB  - Vectors that underpin the natural dispersal of invasive alien species are frequently unknown. In particular, the passive dispersal (zoochory) of one organism (or propagule) by another, usually more mobile animal, remains poorly understood. Field observations of the adherence of invasive freshwater bivalves to other organisms have prompted us to assess the importance of zoochory in the spread of three prolific invaders: zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha; quagga mussel Dreissena bugensis; and Asian clam Corbicula fluminea. An extensive, systematic search of the literature was conducted across multiple on-line scientific databases using various search terms and associated synonyms. In total, only five publications fully satisfied the search criteria. It appears that some fish species can internally transport viable adult D. polymorpha and C. fluminea specimens. Additionally, literature indicates that veligers and juvenile D. polymorpha can adhere to the external surfaces of waterbirds. Overall, literature suggests that zoochorous dispersal of invasive bivalves is possible, but likely a rare occurrence. However, even the establishment of a few individuals (or a single self-fertilising C. fluminea specimen) can, over-time, result in a substantial population. Here, we highlight knowledge gaps, identify realistic opportunities for data collection, and suggest management protocols to mitigate the spread of invasive alien species.
Les vecteurs qui sous-tendent la dispersion naturelle des espèces exotiques envahissantes sont souvent inconnus. En particulier, la dispersion passive (zoochorie) d'un organisme (ou propagule) par un autre, habituellement plus mobile, reste mal comprise. Les observations sur le terrain de l'adhésion des bivalves d'eau douce envahissants à d'autres organismes nous ont incité à évaluer l'importance de la zoochorie dans la propagation de trois envahisseurs prolifiques  : la moule zébrée Dreissena polymorpha ; Moule Quagga Dreissena bugensis ; et la palourde asiatique Corbicula fluminea. Une recherche approfondie et systématique de la littérature a été menée dans de multiples bases de données scientifiques en ligne utilisant différents termes de recherche et synonymes associés. Au total, seulement cinq publications ont pleinement satisfait les critères de recherche. Il semble que certaines espèces de poissons puissent transporter intérieurement des spécimens adultes viables de D. polymorpha et C. fluminea. En outre, la littérature indique que les véligères et les D. polymorpha juvéniles peuvent adhérer aux surfaces externes des oiseaux d'eau. Dans l'ensemble, la littérature suggère que la dispersion par zoochorie des bivalves invasifs est possible, mais probablement une occurrence rare. Cependant, même l'établissement de quelques individus (ou un seul spécimen autofécondant de C. fluminea) peut, au fil du temps, entraîner une population importante. Ici, nous mettons en évidence les lacunes en matière de connaissances, identifions des opportunités réalistes pour la collecte de données et proposons des protocoles de gestion pour atténuer la propagation d'espèces exotiques envahissantes.

T1  - Genetic characterization of the invasive zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) in the Iberian Peninsula
AN  - 1812120315
AB  - The zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas, 1771), is a successful invasive bivalve native to the brackish and freshwaters systems of the Ponto-Caspian regions. It is considered one of the world's 100 worst invasive alien species and has high ecological and economic impacts. Over the past 200 years, it has expanded across the European and North American continents. Since the recent invasion of the Iberian Peninsula in 2001, D. polymorpha has expanded along the Ebro River basin and colonized adjacent basins in Northeastern Iberia. Using 9 microsatellite markers, we analyzed one population from the low Danube and several European and North American introduced locations, including a large number of Iberian sites, to genetically characterize the zebra mussel invasion and to identify putative routes of colonization. Our results reflect a high homogeneity of the Iberian samples, indicating that D. polymorpha colonized the Iberian Peninsula via a single invasion event. The genetic singularity of the populations observed in this region (including 9 unique alleles and significant genetic distances with the rest of analyzed samples) indicates that additional sites from the native and introduced range must be sampled to identify the source of the Iberian invasion.

T1  - Biodiversity in Marine Ecosystems—European Developments toward Robust Assessments
AN  - 2307431442
AB  - Sustainability of marine ecosystems and their services are dependent on marine biodiversity, which is threatened worldwide. Biodiversity protection is a major target of the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive, requiring assessment of the status of biodiversity on the level of species, habitats, and ecosystems including genetic diversity and the role of biodiversity in food web functioning and structure. This paper provides a summary of the development of new indicators and refinement of existing ones in order to address some of the observed gaps in indicator availability for marine biodiversity assessments considering genetic, species, habitat, and ecosystem levels. Promising new indicators are available addressing genetic diversity of microbial and benthic communities. Novel indicators to assess biodiversity and food webs associated with habitats formed by keystone species (such as macroalgae) as well as to map benthic habitats (such as biogenic reefs) using high resolution habitat characterization were developed. We also discuss the advances made on indicators for detecting impacts of non-native invasive species and assessing the structure and functioning of marine food-webs. The latter are based on indicators showing the effects of fishing on trophic level and size distribution of fish and elasmobranch communities well as phytoplankton and zooplankton community structure as food web indicators. New and refined indicators are ranked based on quality criteria). Their applicability for various EU and global biodiversity assessments and the need for further development of new indicators and refinement of the existing ones is discussed.

T1  - Assessing filtration rates of exotic bivalves: dependence on algae concentration and seasonal factors
AN  - 1808732972; PQ0003389972
AB  - Due to their high filtration rates, exotic freshwater bivalves remove suspended organic matter from the water column, transferring resources to the sediment and increasing water clarity, which alters ecosystems. While there is a considerable amount of data on filtration rate of exotic bivalves, comparison between species is often invalid due to the utilization of different protocols for assessing filtration in experimental conditions. In this study, we quantified and compared for the first time the filtration rates of the zebra and quagga mussels and of two invasive Corbicula lineages (forms R and S) as a function of chlorophyll a concentration and season. The highest filtration rate observed was for the zebra mussel in fall and at high algal biomass. The incipient limiting level (ILL), defined as the chlorophyll a concentration at which the maximum filtration rate is observed, was observed in spring and summer in Corbicula species, and in summer and fall in Dreissena species. Overall, filtration rates presented a large range of variation, depending on chlorophyll a and season. Overall, Corbicula form S was observed as the best adapted to low food concentration. Moreover, Corbicula can switch to pedal feeding which gives them a competitive advantage at low chlorophyll a concentrations.

T1  - The effects of invasive rainbow trout on habitat use and diel locomotor activity in the South American Creole perch: an experimental approach
AN  - 1800073332
AB  - The effects of the introduced rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) on both habitat use and diel locomotor activity of the native Creole perch (Percichthys trucha) were assessed. Experiments were performed with juveniles of both species during a 24-h period. Habitat use was measured in channels with different habitat categories, and diel locomotor activity was registered with an infrared sensor. Both species used mainly cobbles. In the absence of O. mykiss, P. trucha used macrophytes and gravel secondarily, during dusk and midnight, respectively. Oncorhynchus mykiss used gravel and macrophytes secondarily, during midday. In the presence of O. mykiss, P. trucha increased its use of macrophytes and decreased its use of less structured habitats. Percichthys trucha juveniles were more active during night. This pattern did not change in the presence of O. mykiss, nor was the intensity of movement affected. These results reveal the importance of structured environments for juveniles of both species. In particular, substrates of large size with interstitial spaces in between serve as shelter and reduce visual detection between individuals. Both the association of P. trucha juveniles with structured habitats and their nocturnal activity reduce predation risk.

T1  - Seasonal and size-related variation of subcellular biomarkers in quagga mussels (Dreissena bugensis) inhabiting sites affected by moderate contamination with complex mixtures of pollutants
AN  - 1798621164
AB  - The size-related differences in subcellular biomarker responses were assessed in Dreissena bugensis mussels inhabiting harbours moderately affected by pollution with complex mixtures of heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Adult D. bugensis samples were collected from three harbours of Lake Balaton (Hungary) characterized by moderate shipping activity, and as reference site, from a highly protected remote area of the lake. Biomarkers of exposure (metallothioneins (MTs), ethoxyresorufin-o-deethylase (EROD)), oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation (LPO), DNA strand breaks (DNAsb)) and possible endocrine disruption (vitellogenin-like proteins (VTG)) were analysed in whole-tissue homogenates of differently sized groups of mussels in relation to environmental parameters and priority pollutants (heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons). Integrated biomarker response (IBR) indices were calculated for biomarker responses gained through in situ measurements to signalize critical sites and to better distinguish natural tendencies from biological effects of contaminants. Biomarker responses showed close positive correlation in case of MT, EROD, LPO, and DNAsb and negative correlation with VTG levels with mussel shell length in autumn, when higher levels of biomarkers appeared, possibly due to natural lifecycle changes of animals.

T1  - Salinity as a barrier for ship hull-related dispersal and invasiveness of dreissenid and mytilid bivalves
AN  - 1795435433
AB  - The benthic stages of Dreissenidae and Mytilidae may be dispersed over long distances while attached to ship hulls. Alternatively, larvae may be transported by water currents and in the ballast and bilge water of ships and vessels. To gain insight into dispersal potential and habitat suitability, survival of the benthic stages of two invasive dreissenid species (Dreissena polymorpha and Mytilopsis leucophaeata) and one mytilid species (Mytilus edulis) chosen based on their occurrence in fresh, brackish and sea water, respectively, were tested in relation to salinity. They were exposed to various salinities in mesocosms during three long-term experiments at outdoor temperatures. Mussel survival was studied without prior acclimation, reflecting conditions experienced when attached to ship hulls while travelling along a salinity gradient from fresh or brackish water to sea water, or vice versa. Initially, mussels react to salinity shock by temporarily closing their valves, suspending ventilation and feeding. However, this cannot be maintained for long periods and adaptation to higher salinity must eventually occur. Bivalve survival was monitored till the last specimen of a test cohort died. The results of the experiments allowed us to distinguish favorable (f.: high tolerance) and unfavorable (u.: no or low tolerance) salinity ranges in practical salinity units (PSU) for each species, viz. for D. polymorpha 0.2-6.0 PSU (f.), 7.0-30.0 PSU (u.), for M. leucophaeata 0.2-17.5 PSU (f.), 20.0-30.0 PSU (u.) and for M. edulis 10.5-36.0 PSU (f.), 0.2-9.0 and 40 PSU (u.). At the unfavorable salinities, all mussels died within 14 days of initial exposure with the exception of M. edulis (23-30 days). The maximum duration of survival of single specimens of D. polymorpha was 318 days at a salinity of 3.2 PSU, of M. leucophaeata 781 days at 15.0 PSU and of M. edulis 1052 days at 15.0 PSU. The number of days survived was compared with the duration of actual ship voyages to estimate the real world survival potentials of species dependent of salinity changes, travel distances and durations. The conclusion is that salinity shocks during the trip were survived within the favorable salinity range but that the species tolerate only for a few weeks the unfavorable salinity range. This functions as a barrier for dispersal. However, at faster and more frequent shipping in the future salinity can become no longer very important as a dispersal barrier.

T1  - Automatic classification of climate change effects on marine species distributions in 2050 using the AquaMaps model
AN  - 1764287093
AB  - Habitat modifications driven by human impact and climate change may influence species distribution, particularly in aquatic environments. Niche-based models are commonly used to evaluate the availability and suitability of habitat and assess the consequences of future climate scenarios on a species range and shifting edges of its distribution. Together with knowledge on biology and ecology, niche models also allow evaluating the potential of species to react to expected changes. The availability of projections of future climate scenarios allows comparing current and future niche distributions, assessing a species' habitat suitability modification and shift, and consequently estimating potential species' reaction. In this study, differences between the distribution maps of 406 marine species, which were produced by the AquaMaps niche models on current and future (year 2050) scenarios, were estimated and evaluated. Discrepancy measurements were used to identify a discrete number of categories, which represent different responses to climate change. Clustering analysis was then used to automatically detect these categories, demonstrating their reliability compared to human supervised classification. Finally, the distribution of characteristics like extinction risk (based on IUCN categories), taxonomic groups, population trends and habitat suitability change over the clustering categories was evaluated. In this assessment, direct human impact was neglected, in order to focus only on the consequences of environmental changes. Furthermore, in the comparison between two climate snapshots, the intermediate phases were assumed to be implicitly included into the model of the 2050 climate scenario.

T1  - Benthic macro-invertebrate fauna associated with Dreissena mussels in the Meuse River: from incapacitating relationships to facilitation
AN  - 1762628200
AB  - Dreissena (Bivalvia: Dreissenidae) species can act as ecosystem engineers, physically altering freshwater ecosystems and changing benthic macro-invertebrate assemblages. The mussel beds they form can provide shelter and food for detritivorous species, whereas fouling can directly impact native bivalves. In this study, we examined the effects of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) and quagga mussel (Dreissena rostriformis) on the macro-invertebrate community in the Meuse River by characterizing the macro-invertebrate assemblage associated with Dreissena clumps on artificial substrates at four sampling sites and by quantifying the infestation of Dreissena on native mussels along six transects. We found that the study site with dense Dreissena clumps on artificial substrates hosted particular macro-invertebrate assemblages that were composed of amphipods, gastropods and some insect larvae. Oligochaeta and Ephemeroptera abundances were low at this site. Non-native Ponto-Caspian amphipods occurred in very high densities in mussel beds, and we report the first records of several new invasive amphipod species in the Meuse River. Our results also revealed that ca. 40 % of sampled Unionidae were infested by Dreissena, although infestation load was low (0.48-2.51 Dreissena per native bivalve). These results suggested that the interactions between Dreissena and other macro-invertebrates ranged between a probably low incapacitating relationship with Unio resulting from a long coexistence which allowed the two species to live in sympatry and a strong facilitation for exotic amphipods native from the same region as Dreissena.

T1  - Forecasting at the edge of the niche: Didemnum vexillum in Southeast Alaska
AN  - 1757872672
AB  - Controlling the spread of marine invasive species is a challenging and costly task. Maps that predict the potential spread of an invader based on known habitat preferences can be extremely valuable for assessing invasion risk and prioritizing management actions for invasion control or prevention. Most maps are developed by using environmental data on the species' known distribution to map the potential niche of the species in a new location. However, this approach is complicated when a species spreads to an area where environmental conditions are much different than in other places it is known to exist. Didemnum vexillum was discovered in Southeast Alaska in 2010, marking the northernmost known range of this species. A self-organizing map (SOM) was used to assess potential habitat for D. vexillum in other parts of Southeast Alaska using summer and winter temperature and salinity as controlling factors. This research highlights the uncertainty of using the species' current distribution to evaluate potential spread to an environment at the edge of a species' environmental tolerances. It also identifies gaps in our knowledge of D. vexillum thermal and salinity tolerances, including potential synergistic and additive effects of both low temperature and low salinity, which limit investigation of mechanistic modeling methods.

AN  - 1790629539
AB  - The introduction of the golden mussel, Limnoperna fortunei (Dunker, 1857) in South America was related to the discharge of ballast water, with its first record in 1991 in the La Plata River estuary. Since then, the species is spreading throughout the continent, with several economic and ecological negative consequences. Aim: To model, in the headwaters of Parana River, the spatial distribution of L. fortunei andtounderstandthe determinants of the current pattern of species distribution and the risk of invasion of areas not yet colonized. Methods: The ecological niche of L. fortunei was modeled using the algorithm MAXENT (Maximum Entropy Method) combined with records of occurrence of the bivalve, limnological data and the shear force measured by the index Hack (SL). The evaluation of the performance of different models was based on AUC (Area Under the Curve).The analysis of each variable's contribution to the responses of the models was made based on the Jackknife test, available in the Maxent program. The models were validated with real absence data collected between 2006 and 2007. Based on the limnological characterization of the area and on outputs of the models, this analysis sought to understand the contributing aspects to the current and potential spatial distribution and to verify the risk of invasion of environments not yet colonized by the species. Results/Conclusion: The limnological characterization showed that the ecological requirements for the species as, pH, calcium, oxygen and chlorophyll a, were appropriate in both the connected stretches, invaded and non-invaded. Turbidity showed significant spatial differences which proved to be higher in environments with higher levels of Hack (SL), i.e. higher energy fluvial. In addition, the algorithm showed the importance of hydrodynamical aspects expressed by Hack index (SL) to the spatial distribution of species, since the models with the best performances were those that considered the Hack index (SL) as one of the environmental layers of the mussel's niche. All models indicated a high risk of invasion into the reservoir of São Simão.

T1  - Resource contributions from dreissenid mussels to the benthic algae Lyngbya wollei (Cyanobacteria) and Cladophora glomerata (Chlorophyta)
AN  - 1736314335
AB  - Dreissena spp. (zebra and quagga mussels) are invasive to North America and increase light to the benthos, provide hard structure for algal attachment, and may contribute limiting nutrients to benthic algae, thereby facilitating algal blooms. We conducted experiments to determine how Dreissena affect nutrient stoichiometry and growth of Lyngbya wollei and Cladophora glomerata, two benthic algal species recently increasing in biomass in parts of the Laurentian Great Lakes, combined with a field survey to determine the likelihood of L. wollei co-occurrence with Dreissena. L. wollei had a significantly higher concentration of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and sulfur when grown with live Dreissena. C. glomerata had greater biomass in tanks with live Dreissena, but did not have significant increases in nutrient concentration like L. wollei did. Neither algal species increased in growth due to the added structure of Dreissena shells. L. wollei biomass was greater in the presence of Dreissena during 1 year (of two) of our field survey. This field survey also showed that L. wollei and Dreissena are likely to co-occur. These results suggest that Dreissena provide several nutrients to benthic algae, and these added resources can promote algal growth and consequently blooms.

T1  - Temperature, Salinity, and Aerial Exposure Tolerance of the Invasive Mussel, Perna viridis, in Estuarine Habitats: Implications for Spread and Competition with Native Oysters, Crassostrea virginica
AN  - 1699499012
AB  - Temperature, salinity, and aerial exposure tolerances of the invasive green mussel, Perna viridis, were investigated under environmentally realistic conditions to address potential competition with native oysters, Crassostrea virginica. This study demonstrated that green mussels exhibit a temperature tolerance range similar to that of its native range (13-30 °C), thereby limiting northern spread of south Florida populations. Salinity tolerances as low as 6 were observed during gradual decreases; however, acute changes resulted in low survival at salinities of 15 and below. At low salinities, even when survival was high, reductions in normal behavior (byssal production and valve closure) were observed. Green mussel survival was significantly inhibited during aerial exposure across all temperatures, and mortality synergistically increased (60-80 %) with increasing temperatures and exposure time. In contrast, oysters demonstrated [greater than or equal to]97 % survival over the exposure period at similar internal temperatures observed in green mussels. Internal temperatures for both species frequently exceeded 33 °C, reaching temperatures as high as 41 °C, while air temperatures averaged only 26.4±1.6 °C. Our results suggest that while Florida green mussel populations exhibit relatively broad temperature and salinity ranges, their spread is limited by the available subtidal habitat, potentially sparing intertidal oyster reefs from habitat and nutrient competition.

T1  - Aquatic invasive species: challenges for the future
AN  - 1657499278
AB  - Issue Title: Emerging Trends in Aquatic Ecology

              
Humans have effectively transported thousands of species around the globe and, with accelerated trade; the rate of introductions has increased over time. Aquatic ecosystems seem at particular risk from invasive species because of threats to biodiversity and human needs for water resources. Here, we review some known aspects of aquatic invasive species (AIS) and explore several new questions. We describe impacts of AIS, factors limiting their dispersal, and the role that humans play in transporting AIS. We also review the characteristics of species that should be the greatest threat for future invasions, including those that pave the way for invasions by other species ("invasional meltdown"). Susceptible aquatic communities, such as reservoirs, may serve as stepping stones for invasions of new landscapes. Some microbes disperse long distance, infect new hosts and grow in the external aquatic medium, a process that has consequences for human health. We also discuss the interaction between species invasions and other human impacts (climate change, landscape conversion), as well as the possible connection of invasions with regime shifts in lakes. Since many invaders become permanent features of the environment, we discuss how humans live with invasive species, and conclude with questions for future research.

T1  - Integrating landscape connectivity and habitat suitability to guide offensive and defensive invasive species management
AN  - 1668254391; PQ0001299957
AB  - Preventing the arrival of invasive species is the most effective way of controlling their impact. Preventative strategies may be 'offensive' aimed at preventing the invader leaving colonised locations or 'defensive' aimed at preventing its arrival at uninvaded locations. The limited resources for invasive species control must be prioritized, particularly for numerous vulnerable locations or uncertainty about which sites are already invaded.We developed an integrative modelling framework to prioritise locations for either strategy by incorporating connectivity and habitat suitability. We applied this framework to a data set comprising 5189 water bodies in Wisconsin and Michigan, U.S.A, for zebra mussels Dreissena polymorpha and Eurasian watermilfoil Myriophyllum spicatum. We developed the framework with a spatial graph based on recreational boater movement and habitat suitability models.An historical graph comprised 3105 natural lakes connected in one of 18 components, whereas a total of 3944 water bodies (lakes and reservoirs) were connected in one of 13 separate components in a graph of the contemporary system. Habitat suitability models accounted for around half of the deviance in the distribution data for each species.There was a distinct spatial pattern in the levels of risk and subsequent recommended allocation of management interventions across several levels of investment. Higher risk water bodies were generally found in the largest component of the spatial graph. At comparatively low levels of investment, where managers target 5% of all locales to control D. polymorpha, the results suggested that 71% and 27% of this effort should be committed to defensive and offensive strategies, respectively, in the largest component. For M. spicatum, 92% and 8% of this effort should be allocated in this component to defensive and offensive strategies, respectively. It is only with much greater investment that water bodies in other components should be targeted.Synthesis and applications. Allocating limited resources to prevent the spread of invasive species is a challenge that transcends ecosystems and geography. We successfully identified a reduced number of locations to target for offensive and defensive intervention strategies for two species. This framework is readily applicable to other aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems vulnerable to invasive species.

T1  - Predicting the spread of aquatic invaders: insight from 200 years of invasion by zebra mussels
AN  - 1701482542; PQ0001494635
AB  - Understanding factors controlling the introduction and spread of species is crucial to improving the management of both natural populations and introduced species. The zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, is considered the most aggressive freshwater invader in the Northern Hemisphere, and is a convenient model system for invasion biology, offering one of the best aquatic examples for examining the invasion process. We used data on 553 of the 1040 glacial lakes in the Republic of Belarus that were examined for the presence of zebra mussels. This study provides a useful approach for predicting the spread of an invader across a landscape with variable habitat suitability that can be applied to a variety of species and systems.

T1  - Aquatic invasive species: general trends in the literature and introduction to the special issue
AN  - 1646554168
AB  - Issue Title: Aquatic Invasive Species

              
Invasion rates are increasing worldwide and most are due to the actions of humans. Deliberate introductions, escapes, and hitchhiking with global commerce transport species to other continents. While most species fail to thrive or have minor impacts on their new ecosystems, the large number of introductions has led to numerous problems. Aquatic invasive species are particularly pervasive and may cause food web disruption, biodiversity loss, and economic harm. Biological invasions appear in an increasing number of publications in the aquatic and general ecology literature. This special issue of Hydrobiologia includes 31 papers on aquatic invasive species and the factors that influence their dispersal and success, along with their impacts. Ecosystems include freshwater ponds, lakes and reservoirs, small streams and large rivers, and coastal marine systems. Study regions occur in temperate, as well as less-studied tropical and sub-tropical regions of four different continents. We discuss the dynamics of invasive species research in the current literature and provide a brief overview of the contributions to this issue.

T1  - Zebra versus quagga mussels: a review of their spread, population dynamics, and ecosystem impacts
AN  - 1646554155
AB  - Issue Title: Aquatic Invasive Species

              
Dreissena polymorpha (zebra mussel) and D. rostriformis bugensis (quagga mussel) continue to spread in Europe and in North America, and have large ecological and economic impacts where they invade. Today many more waterbodies are invaded by zebra mussels, and therefore the extent of their impact is greater than that of quagga mussels. Both species provide additional space and food for invertebrates in the littoral zone, increasing their diversity and density. In contrast, in the profundal zone, quagga mussels may compete for space and food resources with benthic invertebrates, decreasing their diversity and density. The system-wide effect of dreissenids depends on water mixing rates, lake morphology, and turnover rates. Because quagga mussels are found in all regions of a lake, and form larger populations, they may filter larger volumes of water and may have greater system-wide effects, especially in deep lakes, than zebra mussels, which are restricted to shallower portions of lakes. Shortly after initial invasion, as populations increase, both dreissenids will have their largest effects on communities, and most of them will be direct effects. After the initial stage of invasion, impacts are less predictable, and more likely to be caused by indirect effects through changes in the ecosystem.

T1  - Predicting patterns of intentional introduction of non-native largemouth bass into farm ponds in northeastern Japan
AN  - 1647317015
AB  - Non-native species are difficult to eradicate or control once established. Thus, the prevention of invasions is a high priority for conserving native ecosystems. Our objective was to determine the factors that influence illegal introductions of non-native largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) and to develop a model that could be used to predict the pattern of future illegal introduction by anglers. We used generalized linear modeling (GLM) to evaluate the relationship between landscape and environmental factors and the presence of bass in farm ponds. Our results suggest that the occurrence of bass was primarily associated with pond size, distance of ponds from the urban center, and the proportion of the pond shoreline covered with a concrete revetment. We conclude that introductions occurred in ponds that were: easier to locate on a map, closer to anglers' residential areas, and more easily accessible to the pond shore. Last, we suggest our predictive model could be used for preventive measures, such as identifying other ponds most at risk of future illegal introduction of non-native bass.

T1  - Making the Best of a Pest: The Potential for Using Invasive Zebra Mussel (Dreissena Polymorpha) Biomass as a Supplement to Commercial Chicken Feed
AN  - 1622602004; 20903378
AB  - Invasive non-native species frequently occur in very high densities. When such invaders present an economic or ecological nuisance, this biomass is typically removed and landfill is the most common destination, which is undesirable from both an economic and ecological perspective. The zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, has invaded large parts of Europe and North America, and is routinely removed from raw water systems where it creates a biofouling nuisance. We investigated the suitability of dried, whole zebra mussels as a supplement to poultry feed, thus providing a more attractive end-use than disposal to landfill. Measurable outcomes were nutrient and energy composition analyses of the feeds and production parameters of the birds over a 14 day period. Zebra mussels were a palatable feed supplement for chickens. The mussel meal contained high levels of calcium (344.9 g kg super(-1)), essential for egg shell formation, which was absorbed and retained easily by the birds. Compared with standard feed, a mussel-supplemented diet caused no significant effects on production parameters such as egg weight and feed conversion ratio during the study period. However, protein and energy levels in the zebra mussel feed were much lower than expected from the literature. In order for zebra mussels to be a viable long-term feed supplement for poultry, flesh would need to be separated from the shells in an economically viable way. If zebra mussels were to be used with the shells remaining, it seems that the resultant mussel meal would be more suitable as a calcium supplement.

T1  - Physical habitat of zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) in the lower Ebro River (Northeastern Spain): influence of hydraulic parameters in their distribution
AN  - 1534837396; 20083638
AB  - Dreissena polymorpha (zebra mussel) is a freshwater bivalve mollusc and has been present for more than one decade in Spain. The zebra mussel causes serious ecological and socioeconomic impacts in areas where they settle. Our research aims to analyze its hydraulic habitat, developing physical models for this species, which indicates its preference and optimal microhabitat requirements. To get it, a survey was completed in a lotic reach in the lower Ebro River (Tarragona, Spain). Habitat suitability curves for the variables include water velocity, depth, Froude number, velocity/depth ratio, shear stress and shear stress ratio (RSS). In addition, interactive effects between hydraulic parameters on habitat selection and its use were studied and bivariate habitat models were developed. A close relationship was observed between the D. polymorpha presence and mean flow velocity combined with depth, Froude number and RSS. Suitable habitat requirements for Dreissena were detected in areas with stable river beds under high flows, and velocity below 1.2 m/s with a depth of less than 5 m under regular flows. Information about zebra mussel preferences may enhance the design of monitoring programmes and the integrated control management of this invasive mussel.

Our research aims to analyze its hydraulic habitat, developing physical models for this species, which indicates its preference and optimal microhabitat requirements. To get it, a survey was completed in a lotic reach in the lower Ebro River (Tarragona, Spain). Habitat suitability curves for the variables include water velocity, depth, Froude number, velocity/depth ratio, shear stress and shear stress ratio (RSS). In addition, interactive effects between hydraulic parameters on habitat selection and its use were studied and bivariate habitat models were developed. A close relationship was observed between the D. polymorpha presence and mean flow velocity combined with depth, Froude number and RSS. Suitable habitat requirements for Dreissena were detected in areas with stable river beds under high flows, and velocity below 1.2 m/s with a depth of less than 5 m under regular flows. Information about zebra mussel preferences may enhance the design of monitoring programmes and the integrated control management of this invasive mussel.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Invasive bivalves in fresh waters: impacts from individuals to ecosystems and possible control strategies
AN  - 1531588188
AB  - Issue Title: Biology and Conservation of Freshwater Bivalves              Invasive bivalves may cause great ecological, evolutionary, and economic impacts in freshwater ecosystems. Species such as Corbicula fluminea, Dreissena bugensis, Dreissena polymorpha, Limnoperna fortunei, and Sinanodonta woodiana are widely distributed hyper-successful invaders, but several others not yet invasive (or at least not considered as such) may become so in the near future. These species can affect hydrology, biogeochemical cycling, and biotic interactions through several mechanisms, with impacts ranging from individuals to ecosystems. Freshwater invasive bivalves can create no-analog ecosystems, posing serious difficulties for management, but new techniques are becoming available which may enhance options to detect early introductions and mitigate impacts. Although knowledge about the biology of these bivalves has increased considerably in the last two decades, several fundamental gaps still persist; we suggest new research directions that are worth exploring in the near future.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Linking zebra mussel invasion and waterborne commerce in the USA
AN  - 1943075306
AB  - The zebra mussel, a non-indigenous species in North American freshwater ecosystems, has received significant attention over the past two decades as a costly and damaging invader. In the USA, federal-, state-, and local-level policies designed to control and/or prevent the spread of this species remain flawed, in that they do not everywhere account for (or enforce regulations over) all potential anthropogenic dispersal pathways. Ballast water discharge is well-known as an important vector in the dispersal of aquatic invasive species in general, but for the zebra mussel its effects as a source of transmission have rarely been investigated. This article uses simple econometric techniques to measure the relationship between zebra mussel invasion in US states and domestic commercial navigation. Coefficient estimates suggest that incoming waterborne shipments from invaded states are an important determinant of the level of zebra mussel invasion in the receiving state. In designing a comprehensive framework for combating the spread of zebra mussels across US freshwater ecosystems, policy-makers may need to more carefully consider the monitoring and treatment of commercial ships' ballast water discharges as potentially effective strategies.

T1  - Altered trophic pathway and parasitism in a native predator (Lepomis gibbosus) feeding on introduced prey (Dreissena polymorpha)
AN  - 1517744197; 24562470
AB  - Populations of invasive species tend to have fewer parasites in their introduced ranges than in their native ranges and are also thought to have fewer parasites than native prey. This 'release' from parasites has unstudied implications for native predators feeding on exotic prey. In particular, shifts from native to exotic prey should reduce levels of trophically transmitted parasites. We tested this hypothesis in native populations of pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus) in Lake Opinicon, where fish stomach contents were studied intensively in the 1970s, prior to the appearance of exotic zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) in the mid-1990s. Zebra mussels were common in stomachs of present-day pumpkinseeds, and stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen confirmed their importance in long-term diets. Because historical parasite data were not available in Lake Opinicon, we also surveyed stomach contents and parasites in pumpkinseed in both Lake Opinicon and an ecologically similar, neighboring lake where zebra mussels were absent. Stomach contents of pumpkinseed in the companion lake did not differ from those of pre-invasion fish from Lake Opinicon. The companion lake, therefore, served as a surrogate "pre-invasion" reference to assess effects of zebra mussel consumption on parasites in pumpkinseed. Trophically transmitted parasites were less species-rich and abundant in Lake Opinicon, where fish fed on zebra mussels, although factors other than zebra mussel consumption may contribute to these differences. Predation on zebra mussels has clearly contributed to a novel trophic coupling between littoral and pelagic food webs in Lake Opinicon.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Novel Proteins Identified in the Insoluble Byssal Matrix of the Freshwater Zebra Mussel
AN  - 1505334165; 19347473
AB  - The freshwater zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, is an invasive, biofouling species that adheres to a variety of substrates underwater, using a proteinaceous anchor called the byssus. The byssus consists of a number of threads with adhesive plaques at the tips. It contains the unusual amino acid 3, 4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), which is believed to play an important role in adhesion, in addition to providing structural integrity to the byssus through cross-linking. Extensive DOPA cross-linking, however, renders the zebra mussel byssus highly resistant to protein extraction, and therefore limits byssal protein identification. We report here on the identification of seven novel byssal proteins in the insoluble byssal matrix following protein extraction from induced, freshly secreted byssal threads with minimal cross-linking. These proteins were identified by LC-MS/MS analysis of tryptic digests of the matrix proteins by spectrum matching against a zebra mussel cDNA library of genes unique to the mussel foot, the organ that secretes the byssus. All seven proteins were present in both the plaque and thread. Comparisons of the protein sequences revealed common features of zebra mussel byssal proteins, and several recurring sequence motifs. Although their sequences are unique, many of the proteins display similarities to marine mussel byssal proteins, as well as to adhesive and structural proteins from other species. The large expansion of the byssal proteome reported here represents an important step towards understanding zebra mussel adhesion.

T1  - Non-native western tubenose gobies <i>Proterorhinus semilunaris </i>show distinct site, sex and age-related differences in diet
AN  - 1762722417
AB  - The tubenose goby, Proterorhinus semilunaris, has expanded its range throughout Europe. Comprehensive studies to identify its impact on native riverine ecosystems, however, are relatively scarce. Here, we evaluate dietary preferences of P. semilunaris on a non-native river to reveal any such impacts. Fish were sampled monthly over 2011–2012 from three sites along the River Dyje (Czech Republic; Danube basin) with differing population levels and food availability. Both the amount of food consumed and dietary composition varied seasonally, with site having a strong effect. Food consumed differed between males and females, but not dietary composition; while diet differed between age classes, but not food consumed. In general, Trichoptera, Chironomidae and zooplankton dominated the diet at all sites, with Trichoptera taken more often earlier in the year and zooplankton later. Mussels were always avoided, despite high abundance, while less preferred prey were occasionally taken in high numbers in response to increased availability or energy demand (e.g. spawning). Fish eggs and fry (all P. semilunaris) were only taken in high numbers at one site, being related to high population level and fry drift from a reservoir. Male feeding declined over the breeding season, presumably due to nest guarding, while female feeding declined over winter, possibly resulting in high mortality. Proterorhinus semilunaris is a feeding opportunist, which may facilitate colonisation in habitats with poor prey availability. No predation pressure on native species was observed through consumption of eggs or fry, though small/young indigenous fish may be affected through diet competition.Alternate abstract:Le gobie demi-lune, Proterorhinus semilunaris, a élargi son aire de répartition à travers l’Europe. Cependant, les études approfondies afin d’identifier son impact sur les écosystèmes lotiques indigènes, sont relativement rares. Ici, nous évaluons les préférences alimentaires de P. semilunaris dans une rivière où il n’est pas autochtone pour révéler ces impacts. Les poissons ont été échantillonnés mensuellement sur 2011–2012 à partir de trois sites le long de la rivière Dyje (République tchèque; bassin du Danube) avec différents niveaux de population et de disponibilité de la nourriture. À la fois la quantité de nourriture consommée et la composition alimentaire variaient saisonnièrement, le site ayant un effet important. La quantité d’aliments consommés différait entre les sexes, mais pas la composition alimentaire; le régime alimentaire différait entre les classes d’âge. En général, les trichoptères, les larves de chironomes et le zooplancton ont dominé le régime à tous les sites, avec les trichoptères consommés plus souvent plus tôt dans l’année et le zooplancton plus tard. Les moules ont été toujours évitées, malgré leur forte abondance, bien que cette proie moins préférée ait été parfois prise en grand nombre en réponse à sa disponibilité accrue ou à la demande d’énergie (par exemple, pour l’ovogénèse). Les œufs de poissons et les alevins (tous de P. semilunaris) n’ont été pris en grand nombre qu’à un seul site, étant lié à un niveau élevé de la population et à la dérive des alevins à partir d’un réservoir. L’alimentation des mâles a diminué au cours de la saison de reproduction, probablement en raison de la garde des nids, tandis que l’alimentation des femelles a baissé pendant l’hiver, ce qui peut entraîner une mortalité élevée. Proterorhinus semilunaris est un opportuniste dans son alimentation, ce qui peut faciliter la colonisation dans les habitats avec une faible disponibilité en proies. Aucune pression de prédation sur les espèces indigènes n’a été observée par la consommation d’œufs ou d’alevins, mais les petits/jeunes poissons indigènes peuvent être affectés par la concurrence alimentaire.

T1  - Rapid range expansion of the invasive quagga mussel in relation to zebra mussel presence in The Netherlands and Western Europe
AN  - 1492619848; 18957224
AB  - Since its appearance in 2006 in a freshwater section of the Rhine-Meuse estuary (Hollandsch Diep, The Netherlands), the non-indigenous quagga mussel has displayed a rapid range expansion in Western Europe. However, an overview characterising the spread and impacts of the quagga mussel in this area is currently lacking. A literature study, supplemented with field data, was performed to gather all available data and information relating to quagga mussel dispersal. Dispersal characteristics were analysed for rate and direction and in relation to hydrological connectivity and dispersal vectors. To determine ranges of conditions suitable for quagga mussel colonisation, physico-chemical characteristics of their habitats were analysed. After its initial arrival in the freshwater section of the Rhine-Meuse estuary and River Danube, the quagga mussel demonstrated a rapid and continued range expansion in Western Europe. Quagga mussels have extended their non-native range to the network of major waterways in The Netherlands and in an upstream direction in the River Rhine (Germany), its tributaries (rivers Main and Moselle) and the River Meuse (Belgium and France). The calculated average quagga mussel dispersal rate in Europe was 120 km year super(-1) (range 23-383 km year super(-1)). Hydrological connectivity is important in determining the speed with which colonisation occurs. Dispersal to water bodies disconnected from the freshwater network requires the presence of a suitable vector e.g. pleasure boats transferred over land. Upstream dispersal is primarily human mediated through the attachment of mussels to watercraft. The relative abundance of quagga mussel to zebra mussel has greatly increased in a number of areas sampled in the major Dutch rivers and lakes and the rivers Main and Rhine and the Rhine-Danube Canal leading to a dominance shift from zebra mussels to quagga mussels. However, evidence for displacement of the zebra mussel is limited due to the lack of temporal trends relating to the overall density of zebra and quagga mussel.

T1  - Predation on invasive zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, by pumpkinseed sunfish, rusty crayfish, and round goby
AN  - 1458851324
AB  - The enemy release hypothesis states that invasive species are successful in their new environment because native species are not adapted to utilize the invasive. If true for predators, native predators should have lower feeding rates on the invasive species than a predator from the native range of the invasive species. We tested this hypothesis for zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) by comparing handling time and predation rate on zebra mussels in the laboratory by two North American species (pumpkinseed, Lepomis gibbosus, and rusty crayfish, Orconectes rusticus) and one predator with a long evolutionary history with zebra mussels (round goby, Neogobius melanostomus). Handling time per mussel (7 mm shell length) ranged from 25 to >70 s for the three predator species. Feeding rates on attached zebra mussels were higher for round goby than the two native predators. Medium and large gobies consumed 50-67 zebra mussels attached to stones in 24 h, whereas pumpkinseed and rusty crayfish consumed <11. This supports the hypothesis that the rapid spread of zebra mussels in North America was facilitated by low predation rates from the existing native predators. At these predation rates and realistic goby abundance estimates, round goby could affect zebra mussel abundance in some lakes.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Invasion ratcheting in the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) and the ability of native and invaded ranges to predict its global distribution
AN  - 1468384217; 18831097
AB  - In this study, we investigate changes in the environmental niche of an important pest species, the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha), across its world-wide distribution. The ability of models based on the native (Ponto-Caspian) and invaded (Western European and North American) ranges to accurately model the potential distribution of zebra mussel elsewhere was also investigated. Europe and North America. A comprehensive cross-continental occurrence database of the zebra mussel was used to explore the species' native and invaded ranges using univariate and multivariate analyses. In addition, ecological niche models (ENMs, employing MaxEnt) were used to investigate the ability of the native and invaded ranges to describe the species' distribution elsewhere. We found the zebra mussel to occupy different, but partly overlapping, environmental niches in the native Ponto-Caspian region and invaded European and North American regions. Accordingly, the ENMs calibrated with the native range accurately predicted regions of early colonization in Europe and North America, but not the subsequent expansion. ENMs calibrated with data from the European range failed to describe the invaded range in North America, and vice versa. Climate suitability curves further confirmed a progressive spatio-temporal stretching of the climatic tolerance of the zebra mussel. This study provides novel evidence of multiple episodes of niche expansion in a notorious invasive species, and supports the use of partial ranges to better understand the species' spatio-temporal history of invasion. Separately, the native and invaded ranges provided important information regarding the species' environmental tolerance and the regions that are most suitable for first colonization, as well as identifying regions at risk in the case of a possible reintroduction. Collectively, the differences between the three ecological niche projections of the zebra mussel demonstrate that niche expansion of an invasive species within a new geographical region promotes the organism's further invasion in space and time, a process known as invasion ratcheting.

T1  - Environmental factors shaping the distribution of common wintering waterbirds in a lake ecosystem with developed shoreline
AN  - 1428715101
AB  - In this study, we tested whether the spatial distribution of waterbirds is influenced by shoreline urbanization or other habitat characteristics. We conducted monthly censuses along shoreline sections of a continental lake (Lake Balaton, Hungary) to assess the abundance of 11 common species that use this lake as a feeding and staging area during migration and winter. We estimated the degree of urbanization of the same shoreline sections and also measured other habitat characteristics (water depth, extent of reed cover, biomass of zebra mussels, distances to waste dumps and to other wetlands). We applied linear models and model averaging to identify habitat variables with high relative importance for predicting bird distributions. Bird abundance and urbanization were strongly related only in one species. Other habitat variables exhibited stronger relationships with bird distribution: (1) diving ducks and coots preferred shoreline sections with high zebra mussel biomass, (2) gulls preferred sites close to waste dumps, and (3) the abundances of several species were higher on shoreline sections close to other wetlands. Our findings suggest that the distribution of waterbirds on Lake Balaton is largely independent of shoreline urbanization and influenced by food availability and connectivity between wetlands.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Diet of Northern Map Turtles (Graptemys geographica): Sexual Differences and Potential Impacts of an Altered River System
AN  - 1444911589
AB  - Alterations of flow regimen, pollution, and introductions of exotic species have significantly altered the composition of invertebrates in many river systems throughout the world. How these alterations affect the diet of higher level predators is not well understood. We studied the diet of the Northern Map Turtle (Graptemys geographica) In the damregulated Susquehanna River in north-central Maryland. Northern Map Turtles are a relatively large, top-order predator that is legally endangered in the state and is impacted by commercial collecting elsewhere. Gastropods, trlchopteran larvae, and invasive Corbicula sp. predominated across diet samples. Marked sexual and size-related differences occurred. Adult male G. geographica fed primarily on a group of small gastropod species (Planorbidae, Hydrobiidae, Physidae), trichopterans, and Corbicula, while adult females fed primarily on pleurocerid snails. There was virtually no overlap in the diets of the two sexes of G. geographica. This is of special conservation concern because two different groups of prey are needed in order to support this population of Northern Map Turtles, and many North American pleurocerid gastropod species are highly endangered and also threatened by hydroelectric activity. Our results are consistent with reports of other Map Turtle populations before the invasion of Zebra Mussels (Dreissena sp.), which often result in a sharp change in diet. Zebra Mussels have already been documented immediately upstream of our study site, so impacts from this invasive species may become apparent in the near future. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Genetic and phenoptypic differentiation of zebra mussel populations colonizing Spanish river basins
AN  - 1399494145; 23681738
AB  - Issue Title: Transgenerational and Evolutionary Responses in Environmental Species

              
Zebra mussel populations in Ebro and Mijares Rivers (northern Spain) were analyzed to study the mechanisms by which this aquatic species deals with pollution. Variability analyses of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene and of one nuclear microsatellite were performed for ten populations from the Ebro River and one from the Mijares River. Comparison of these results with those from five additional European populations indicated that the Spanish populations constitute a homogeneous gene pool. Transcriptome analyses of gill samples from a subset of the Spanish populations showed changes on expression levels that correlated with variations in general fitness and loads of heavy metals. The less polluted upstream Ebro populations showed overexpression of mitochondrial and cell proliferation-related genes compared to the more polluted, downstream Ebro populations. Our data indicate that heavy metals were the main factors explaining these transcriptomic patterns, and that zebra mussel is resilient to pollutants (like mercury and organochlorine compounds) proved to be extremely toxic to vertebrates. We propose that zebra mussel populations sharing a common gene pool may acclimate to different levels and forms of pollution through modulations in their transcriptomic profile, although direct selection on genes showing differential expression patterns cannot be ruled out.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Indirect trophic interactions with an invasive species affect phenotypic divergence in a top consumer
AN  - 1327525789; 23463242
AB  - While phenotypic responses to direct species interactions are well studied, we know little about the consequences of indirect interactions for phenotypic divergence. In this study we used lakes with and without the zebra mussel to investigate effects of indirect trophic interactions on phenotypic divergence between littoral and pelagic perch. We found a greater phenotypic divergence between littoral and pelagic individuals in lakes with zebra mussels and propose a mussel-mediated increase in pelagic and benthic resource availability as a major factor underlying this divergence. Lakes with zebra mussels contained higher densities of large plankton taxa and large invertebrates. We suggest that this augmented resource availability improved perch foraging opportunities in both the littoral and pelagic zones. Perch in both habitats could hence express a more specialized foraging morphology, leading to an increased divergence of perch forms in lakes with zebra mussels. As perch do not prey on mussels directly, we conclude that the increased divergence results from indirect interactions with the mussels. Our results hence suggest that species at lower food web levels can indirectly affect phenotypic divergence in species at the top of the food chain.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - STATUS OF PHYTOPLANKTON, ZOOPLANKTON, AND BENTHOS
AN  - 1431403034
AB  - The main basin of Lake Huron has historically been regarded as one of the least productive of the Laurentian Great Lakes with a trophic state intermediate between Lake Superior, the most oligotrophic of the lakes, and Lake Michigan. Inputs of chemical constituents to the system are determined in large part by inflows in the north from Lake Michigan and Lake Superior, the latter via the St Marys River, and inputs from Saginaw Bay in the south. As a result, water-quality characteristics in Lake Huron are intermediate between the other two upper lakes. The Great Lakes National Program Office of the US Environmental Protection Agency has conducted regular biannual monitoring of the main basin of Lake Huron since 1983. The monitoring effort is focused on detecting whole-lake responses to changes in loadings of anthropogenic substances as well as impacts of invasive species, so sampling is restricted largely to the relatively homogeneous offshore waters of the main basin.

T1  - Recovery Potential Assessment of Lilliput (Toxolasma parvum) in Canada.
TT  - Evaluation du potentiel de retablissement du toxolasme nain (Toxolasma parvum) au canada
AN  - 1942219220; PQ0004361809
AB  - In May 2013, the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) assessed the status of Lilliput (Toxolasma parvum) and determined the designation to be Endangered. The reason provided for this designation is that, 'This species has a fairly restricted range in Canada, confined to tributaries of Lake St. Clair, Lake Erie, and Lake Ontario. Populations once found in the open Canadian waters of Lake St. Clair, Lake Erie and the Detroit River have disappeared. Overall, the species has lost 44% of its former range in Canada. The invasion of freshwater habitat by the exotic Zebra and Quagga mussels, combined with pollution from urban development and sedimentation are the main cause of populations disappearing and the range shrinking.' Lilliput is currently not listed under the Species at Risk Act (SARA). A species Recovery Potential Assessment (RPA) process has been developed by Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) Science to provide the information and scientific advice required to meet the various requirements of the SARA, including advice to the Minister of DFO regarding the listing of the species under the SARA. It is also used when analyzing the socio-economic impacts of adding the species to the list as well as during subsequent consultations, where applicable. If listed, this scientific advice will also be used in the development of a recovery strategy, and to support decision-making with regards to SARA agreements and permits. This assessment considers the scientific data available to assess the recovery potential of Lilliput in Canada.Original Abstract: En mai 2013, le Comite sur la situation des especes en peril au Canada (COSEPAC) a evalue la situation du toxolasme nain (Toxolasma parvum) et lui a attribue le statut d'espece en voie de disparition. La raison invoquee pour cette designation etait la suivante : 'Cette espece a une aire de repartition passablement restreinte au Canada, etant confinee aux affluents des lacs Sainte-Claire, Erie et Ontario. Les populations autrefois trouvees dans les eaux libres canadiennes du lac Sainte-Claire, du lac Erie et de la riviere Detroit ont disparu. Dans l'ensemble, l'espece a disparu de 44 % de son ancienne aire de repartition au Canada. L'invasion de l'habitat d'eau douce par les moules exotiques zebrees et quagga, couplee a la pollution provenant du developpement urbain et de la sedimentation, sont la principale cause de la disparition des populations et de la reduction de l'aire de repartition.' A l'heure actuelle, le toxolasme nain n'est pas inscrit sur la liste en vertu de la Loi sur les especes en peril (LEP). Le secteur des Sciences de Peches et Oceans Canada (MPO) a mis en place un processus d'evaluation du potentiel de retablissement (EPR) pour l'espece afin de fournir l'information et les avis scientifiques requis en vertu des diverses exigences de la LEP, dont l'autorisation de mener des activites qui constitueraient autrement une infraction a la LEP, et l'elaboration de programmes de retablissement. On se sert egalement de ces renseignements scientifiques pour conseiller le ministre des Peches et des Oceans au sujet de l'inscription de l'espece en vertu de la LEP, pour analyser les repercussions socio- economiques de l'inscription de cette nouvelle espece sur la liste ainsi que pour les consultations subsequentes, le cas echeant. Cette evaluation tient compte de toutes les donnees scientifiques existantes permettant d'evaluer le potentiel de retablissement du toxolasme nain au Canada.

T1  - Impacts of dreissenid mussel invasions on chlorophyll and total phosphorus in 25 lakes in the USA
AN  - 1530191774
AB  - Summary

              
1.Invasions of zebra and quagga mussels have had long-term, large-scale impacts on lake ecosystems in the USA as characterised by high abundance, broad-scale spread and effective adaption to new environmental conditions. Due to their high filtering capacity, decreases in chlorophyll a (Chl) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations have been reported in many affected lakes.

              
2.In 25 US lakes, we analysed the effects of dreissenid invasions on changes in Chl and TP concentrations, measured as the probability of a concentration decrease in the post-invasion period and changes in Chl-TP relationships using Bayesian hierarchical regressions. We also examined whether changes in Chl and TP concentrations and in the Chl-TP relationship differed according to lake hydromorphology, such as mean depth or mixing status (mixed versus stratified lakes).

              
3.Our results showed that dreissenid invasions were often, but not always, associated with subsequent TP and Chl declines. Dreissenid effects on Chl and TP may be influenced by lake thermal structure. Decreases in Chl and TP were consistently found in mixed lakes where benthic-pelagic coupling is tight, while the effects were less predictable in stratified lakes. Within stratified lakes, Chl and TP reductions were more clearly discernible in deeper lakes with long water residence times.

              
4.Regression results demonstrated that a joint increase in slope and decrease in intercept and a tighter correlation of the Chl-TP relationship were likely to occur in dreissenid-invaded lakes; this does not support the idea of a shift from bottom-up to top-down control of primary production. These results have important implications for management, suggesting that a relaxation of TP standards would be unwarranted.

              
5.Across lakes, the slope of the Chl-TP relationship for mixed lakes was substantially higher than that for stratified lakes before mussel invasion, indicating an important role of light in limiting primary production. The slope differences between mixed and stratified lakes decreased in the post-invasion period, possibly because mussel filtration results in a relaxation of light limitation that is more pronounced in deeper, stratified lakes.

T1  - Interrelations between Dreissena polymorpha colonization and autotrophic periphyton development - a field study in a temperate floodplain lake
AN  - 1512338139; 19519953
AB  - Temporal changes in autotrophic periphyton (algae and cyanobacteria) in relation to the colonization of Dreissena polymorpha, an invasive species, were investigated in situ using artificial substrata (glass slides) from April to August of 2008 in a Danubian floodplain. The colonization of cyanobacteria and planktonic diatoms firmly attached to the substrata followed by the development of apical pad forming diatoms and stalk forming diatoms, resulted in the rapid formation of a three-dimensional structure of periphyton. Increasing water temperatures, together with the well developed autotrophic periphyton, supported the colonization of Dreissena. A total of 16 size classes of Dreissena were found during the gradual mussel community development. The community most likely formed from the initially settled larvae which dominated the first period of aggregation, while adult individuals dominated the later phase, contributing to the increase in habitat complexity. High competition for space and nutrients on small-size substrata limited the autotrophic periphyton to achieve the "climax community" characterized by filamentous green algae. Consequently, algal abundance decreased and diatoms firmly attached to the substrata prevailed. The decrease in mussel abundance at the end of the colonization experiment enabled a gradual increase in diatom abundance and redevelopment of a three-dimensional autotrophic periphyton structure. Altogether, our results showed that dense coverage of hard surfaces by mussels may have negatively influenced the algal community causing a significant decrease in algal abundance and a shift to the dominance of species resistant to the disturbance.

T1  - Risk assessment for three Dreissenid mussels (Dreissena polymorpha, Dreissena rostriformis bugensis, and Mytilopsis leucophaeata) in Canadian freshwater ecosystems.
TT  - Evaluation des risques poses par trois especes de moules dreissenidees (Dreissena polymorpha, Dreissena rostriformis bugensis et Mytilopsis leucophaeata) dans les ecosystemes d'eau douce au Canada
AN  - 1439232481; 18640014
AB  - An ecological risk assessment for three dreissenid mussel species: the Zebra Mussel (Dreissena polymorpha); the Quagga Mussel (D. rostriformis bugensis); and the Dark Falsemussel (Mytilopsis leucopheata) was conducted for freshwater ecosystems in the western Canadian provinces, Ontario, and Quebec. This risk assessment considered probabilities of survival (habitat suitability) and arrival to 108 Canadian sub-drainages and the ecological impacts associated with these species. The ecological risk associated with both zebra mussel and quagga mussel invasions across the western provinces and watersheds directly adjacent to the Laurentian Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River was considered high. In contrast, the risk was considered low for most of eastern Ontario and Quebec where calcium concentrations were deemed too low to support large (invasive) populations. Due to the high salinity requirements of dark falsemussel, the ecological risk associated with this species was considered low for all Canadian freshwater ecosystems. However, the scope of this risk assessment did not consider coastal estuarine habitats where the ecological risk could be substantially higher. The largest ecological impacts associated with zebra mussel and quagga mussel were negative impacts on biota that inhabit the pelagic (offshore) zones of lakes or rivers (e.g., losses in productivity for phytoplankton, zooplankton, and planktivorous fishes), and to unionid mussels (severe declines in abundance and biodiversity).Original Abstract: Une evaluation des risques ecologiques poses par trois especes de moules dreissenidees : la moule zebree (Dreissena polymorpha), la moule quagga (D. rostriformis bugensis) et la moule d'Amerique (Mytilopsis leucopheata) a ete menee pour les ecosystemes d'eau douce des provinces de l'Ouest canadien, de l'Ontario et du Quebec. La presente evaluation des risques s'est penchee sur les probabilites de survie (habitats propices) et d'arrivee de ces especes dans 108 sous-bassins versants canadiens ainsi que leurs impacts ecologiques. D'apres l'evaluation, les risques ecologiques lies aux invasions de la moule zebree et de la moule quagga dans les provinces et les bassins-versants de l'Ouest situes directement a cote des Grands Lacs laurentiens et du fleuve Saint-Laurent seraient eleves. En revanche, on a juge que le risque etait faible pour la majeure partie de l'Ontario et du Quebec, ou les concentrations de calcium ont ete considerees comme trop faibles pour soutenir de grandes populations (envahissantes). En raison des exigences elevees de la moule d'Amerique en matiere de salinite, on considere que le risque ecologique lie a cette espece est faible pour l'ensemble des ecosystemes d'eau douce au Canada. Toutefois, les habitats cotiers estuariennes, ou le risque ecologique pourrait etre beaucoup plus eleve, ne faisaient pas l'objet de la presente evaluation. Les impacts ecologiques les plus importants de la moule zebree et de la moule quagga sont les effets negatifs sur le biote vivant dans les zones pelagiques (extracotieres) des lacs et des rivieres (p. ex., pertes de productivite du phytoplancton, du zooplancton et des poissons planctonophages) et sur les unionides (declins considerables de l'abondance et de la biodiversite).

T1  - Impacts of dreissenid mussel invasions on chlorophyll and total phosphorus in 25 lakes in the USA
AN  - 1257779070; 17478431
AB  - 1.Invasions of zebra and quagga mussels have had long-term, large-scale impacts on lake ecosystems in the USA as characterised by high abundance, broad-scale spread and effective adaption to new environmental conditions. Due to their high filtering capacity, decreases in chlorophyll a (Chl) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations have been reported in many affected lakes. 2.In 25 US lakes, we analysed the effects of dreissenid invasions on changes in Chl and TP concentrations, measured as the probability of a concentration decrease in the post-invasion period and changes in Chl-TP relationships using Bayesian hierarchical regressions. We also examined whether changes in Chl and TP concentrations and in the Chl-TP relationship differed according to lake hydromorphology, such as mean depth or mixing status (mixed versus stratified lakes). 3.Our results showed that dreissenid invasions were often, but not always, associated with subsequent TP and Chl declines. Dreissenid effects on Chl and TP may be influenced by lake thermal structure. Decreases in Chl and TP were consistently found in mixed lakes where benthic-pelagic coupling is tight, while the effects were less predictable in stratified lakes. Within stratified lakes, Chl and TP reductions were more clearly discernible in deeper lakes with long water residence times. 4.Regression results demonstrated that a joint increase in slope and decrease in intercept and a tighter correlation of the Chl-TP relationship were likely to occur in dreissenid-invaded lakes; this does not support the idea of a shift from bottom-up to top-down control of primary production. These results have important implications for management, suggesting that a relaxation of TP standards would be unwarranted. 5.Across lakes, the slope of the Chl-TP relationship for mixed lakes was substantially higher than that for stratified lakes before mussel invasion, indicating an important role of light in limiting primary production. The slope differences between mixed and stratified lakes decreased in the post-invasion period, possibly because mussel filtration results in a relaxation of light limitation that is more pronounced in deeper, stratified lakes.

T1  - Historic nutrient loading and recent species invasions caused shifts in water quality and zooplankton demography in two Finger Lakes (New York, USA)
AN  - 1113227057; 17196927
AB  - We investigated the paleolimnology of Owasco and Seneca Lakes (New York, USA) and compiled water-quality monitoring data to describe environmental change during the past two centuries. Trophic shifts were detected in the oligotrophic to mesotrophic range and were likely driven by nutrient loading and species invasion. Based on box core reconstructions, primary production increased in both lakes during the last century, which is evidenced by the amount, type and isotopic composition of material preserved in the sediment. Organic matter accumulation and its stable carbon isotopic composition, as well as carbonate abundance, began to increase during the 1960s in Owasco Lake and the 1850s in Seneca Lake. Further, the abundance of phytoplanktivorous cladocera subfossils increased beginning in the 1910s in Seneca Lake and in the 1960s in Owasco Lake. The different timing and magnitude of the trophic shifts likely resulted from contrasts in lake residence time and species assemblages between the two lakes. The increases in primary and secondary production paralleled, and are interpreted to reflect, increased allochthonous nutrient loading. However, nutrient loading was not detected in the water-quality data, perhaps because of strong uptake of phosphates by phytoplankton or due to limited data collection. Rapid changes in cladoceran subfossils and water quality were also detected during the last decade. Concurrent with the establishment of non-native Cercopagis pengoi (fishhook waterflea), phytoplanktivorous cladocera remains declined, and the mucrone length of Bosmina increased, consistent with predictions of increased invertebrate predation. Additionally, the post-1990 decline in sediment carbonate, increased Secchi depth and decreased chlorophyll a concentrations followed the establishment of filter-feeding Dreissena spp. (zebra and quagga mussels). Collectively, paleolimnological data and water-quality monitoring provided a more complete and consistent record of shifts in the productivity of Owasco and Seneca Lakes, which were useful to understand environmental changes over different time scales. Physical, geochemical and biological changes were temporally consistent among three cores collected from different locations in each lake, but differed in magnitude for several variables (e.g., grain size and cladoceran subfossils), which could reflect near-shore to offshore gradients.

T1  - An indirect effect of biological invasions: the effect of zebra mussel fouling on parasitisation of unionid mussels by bitterling fish
AN  - 1037271622
AB  - Invasive species represent a major threat with both direct and indirect effects on natural ecosystems, including effects on established and coevolved relationships. In a series of experiments, we examined how the interaction between two native species, a unionid mussel (Unio pictorum) and the European bitterling (Rhodeus amarus), a fish that parasitises unionids, was affected by the non-native zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha). The zebra mussel fouls hard substrates, including shells of living unionids, and its presence is often associated with a decrease in population density of native unionid mussels. Bitterling lay their eggs into live unionids and the embryos develop inside their gills. Using a range of zebra mussel densities, we demonstrated that zebra mussel fouling had a negative effect on the number of bitterling eggs inside the mussel host, with abundances of 5-10 zebra mussels (shell size 15-25 mm) per unionid critical for bitterling ability to utilise the host. In a further experiment, we found that bitterling did not discriminate between unfouled unionids and those fouled with five zebra mussels. Most ovipositions into fouled hosts, however, were unsuccessful as eggs failed to reach the unionid gills. We discuss implications of such unsuccessful ovipositions for bitterling recruitment and population dynamics.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Behavioural changes of zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha (Bivalvia) induced by Ponto-Caspian gammarids
AN  - 1069194618; 17134178
AB  - Colonies of an invasive Ponto-Caspian zebra mussel constitute suitable habitats for many invertebrate organisms, including Ponto-Caspian gammarids that are now spreading throughout Europe. There is, however, little known of the impact of these gammarids on their mussel hosts which they live amongst. We studied the behaviour of zebra mussels in the presence of three gammarid species that differed in their origin and degree of association with Dreissena habitats. In the presence of the Ponto-Caspian invader Dikerogammarus villosus that was commonly observed in mussel habitats, mussels responded by increasing their attachment strength and reducing upward movement. The responses to the Ponto-Caspian Pontogammarus robustoides, a species that showed no preferences for mussel habitats, were weaker and limited to the increase of attachment strength. There were no behavioural changes in mussels exposed to the native Gammarus fossarum. As mussels only responded to gammarids moving freely among their shells and not to those kept behind a mesh barrier, the most likely factor causing these changes was mechanical irritation of their soft parts by amphipod appendages. This hypothesis was further confirmed in an additional experiment with a South-American catfish Corydoras paleatus used as another potential source of mechanical irritation. The responses of zebra mussels to gammarids were similar to their anti-predator defences shown earlier in the presence of molluscivorous roach. Thus, it appears likely that Ponto Caspian gammarids within mussel colonies have the capacity to compromise the normal functioning of bivalves through inducing their defensive responses.

T1  - Trends of total cadmium, copper, and zinc in the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) along the upper reach of the St. Lawrence River: 1994--2005
AN  - 1032637452; 21922178
AB  - This study examines spatial and temporal variability of bioaccumulation of cadmium, copper, and zinc in tissues of zebra mussels in the upper reach of the St. Lawrence River which originates at the outflow of Lake Ontario. It was hypothesized that concentrations of these metals in mussel tissues would decline over time and decrease with increasing distance from the outlet of Lake Ontario as a result of on-going efforts to reduce contaminant discharges into the lake. Size of mussels was also evaluated as a factor influencing bioaccumulation. Mussels were collected annually in October from six sites from 1994 to 2005, including one site near a local industry. Individuals were grouped into five or more size classes per site in each year. Soft tissues were analyzed for total cadmium, copper and zinc. Concentrations of cadmium and copper in tissues varied significantly both spatially and temporally. Cadmium concentrations were elevated at most sites; copper concentrations were moderately elevated compared with other studies in the Lake Ontario basin and St. Lawrence River. Zinc showed the most uniformity in mussels possibly due to internal regulation and to low levels of environmental exposure. Animal size correlated with copper concentrations of tissues in approximately 30% of samples but infrequently for cadmium and zinc. Cadmium and copper levels were found to decline downstream over time. Inter-annual variability of metal concentrations in mussel tissues suggests utilization in long-term monitoring programs to discern significant trends. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Biological and ecological mechanisms for overcoming sperm limitation in invasive dreissenid mussels
AN  - 1022246576
AB  - Many broadcast-spawning benthic invertebrates are subject to sperm limitation yet achieve high population densities, as for example dreissenid mussels (Dreissena polymorpha and Dreisssena bugensis) that were introduced into the Laurentian Great Lakes. The question remains whether biological or ecological/physical mechanisms reduce sperm limitation. Gamete dilution/longevity experiments were undertaken to determine whether dreissenid mussels are subject to sperm limitation, and computational fluid dynamic modeling was used to determine the potential influence of bottom roughness on sperm dilution in nature. Results indicated that dreissenid mussels may be sperm limited, but the extent to which sperm dilution affects them is lower than what was reported for other broadcast spawning invertebrates. Importantly, model mussel clusters influenced external fertilization by retaining sperm in downstream eddies but allowing downstream transport from one cluster to another. This, in addition to high sperm potency at low sperm concentrations, may help to explain the success of dreissenid mussels as invasive species.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Low dissolved ions may limit secondary invasion of inland waters by exotic round gobies and dreissenid mussels in North America
AN  - 1017984129; 16734605
AB  - Round gobies and dreissenid mussels, exotic species in the North American Great Lakes basin, are euryhaline organisms whose geographic spread and ecological impacts in freshwaters may be limited by low levels of dissolved ions such as calcium (Ca). We measured source populations of these exotics in the St. Lawrence River and found population densities of dreissenids (range of similar to 1,000-6,400 individuals m super(-2)) and round gobies (6-32 individuals m super(-2)) similar to those in other Great Lake locations from which they have spread inland. However, we found little evidence for their secondary invasion of inland tributary rivers and lakes of northern New York State. Using natural waters collected from inland ecosystems, we ran laboratory bioassays of reproduction, growth, and survival of several life stages of zebra and quagga mussels as well as the round goby. We found little difference in the responses of zebra and quagga mussels, with each species showing moderate reproductive success, growth, and survival at Ca concentrations > 13 mg L super(-1) and dramatic improvements at >18 mg L super(-1). Round gobies showed moderate survival in waters with Ca concentrations > 8 mg L super(-1) and high survival > 18 mg L super(-1). These bioassays are the first such experiments for quagga mussels and round gobies and show how all three species may be similarly restricted in their ability to invade and permanently colonize significant geographic regions of New York State and perhaps the US.

T1  - Effects of invasive zebra mussels on phytoplankton, turbidity, and dissolved nutrients in reservoirs
AN  - 929021579
AB  - Few experiments have quantified the effects of invasive zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) on man-made reservoirs relative to other aquatic habitats. Reservoirs, however, are the dominate water body type in many of the states that are at the current front of the zebra mussel invasion into the western United States. The objective of this research, therefore, was to determine how zebra mussels affected phytoplankton, turbidity, and dissolved nutrients in water that was collected from three Kansas reservoirs that varied in trophic state (mesotrophic to hypereutrophic), but all experienced frequent cyanobacterial blooms. Laboratory mesocosm experiments were conducted to document the effects of zebra mussels on cyanobacteria and general water quality characteristics in the reservoir water. Zebra mussels significantly reduced algal biomass, and the total biovolume of cyanobacteria (communities were dominated by Anabaena) in each reservoir experiment. The effects of zebra mussels on other major algal groups (diatoms, flagellates, and green algae) and algal diversity were less consistent and varied between the three reservoir experiments. Similarly, the effects of zebra mussels on nutrient concentrations varied between experiments. Zebra mussels increased dissolved phosphorus concentrations in two of the reservoir experiments, but there was no effect of zebra mussels on dissolved phosphorus in the mesotrophic reservoir experiment. Combined, our results strongly suggest that zebra mussels have the potential to significantly impact reservoirs as they continue to expand throughout the western United States. Moreover, the magnitude of these effects may be context dependent and vary depending on the trophic state and/or resident phytoplankton communities of individual reservoirs as has similarly been reported for natural lakes.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Density effects on the clearance rate of the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha: flume study results
AN  - 907043437
AB  - Zebra mussel filtration rates and regulating factors have been addressed earlier in a number of studies. Still, only a few of them have taken into consideration the refiltration phenomenon, and therefore the direct extrapolation of experimental results may only give the potential filtering capacity, and hence, over- or underestimate the actual amount of seston being removed by zebra mussels in an ecosystem. The current experimental study aimed to gain insight into the refiltration effect on the clearance rate of the zebra mussels at relatively high seston concentrations, and its potential role in controlling the filtration efficiency of the zebra mussel population. The experiment was conducted in a laboratory flume following the Latin squares design with one fixed (mussel density) and three random factors (initial total particulate matter (TPM) concentration, flume "wall effect" and distance from the flume inflow area) considered. The results showed the significant effects of mussel density and the TPM concentration on the effective clearance rate (ECR) of zebra mussels. The higher ECR values were obtained at denser mussel clumps and lower TPM concentrations. The flume "wall effect" had no significant effect on the ECR, whereas the distance from the flume inflow area appeared to have a significant impact. A positive relationship between ECR and the zebra mussel density was most evident in the proximity of the TPM source. Based on the results, we assume that at high TPM concentration, refiltration may assert itself by the elevated net clearance rate of mussels within dense clumps compared to that of mussels at relatively low individual densities. This should be taken into consideration while modelling and assessing the role of the zebra mussel in energy flow and redistribution of organic matter in an ecosystem.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - In freshwater and some estuarine ecosystems, two prominent dreissenid mussels, the Zebra Mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) and Quagga Mussel (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis), both native to the PontoCaspian region, have a long history of invasion in both Europe and North America. Further, a related dreissenid mussel species, the Dark Falsemussel (also known as Conrad's Falsemussel) (Mytilopsis leucopheata), has expanded its range to brackish water habitats across Europe and North America. Dreissenid mussels have had disproportionately large economic and ecological impacts due to their ability for rapid dispersal within and across continents, resulting in severe negative impacts on food webs and nutrient processing. Given the potential for non-indigenous species to have substantial negative impacts on Canadian ecosystems as well as the steady migration west, several western provinces requested Fisheries and Oceans Canada (through the Centre of Expertise for Aquatic Risk Assessment (CEARA)) to undertake a national risk assessment to determine the potential risk posed by three species of dreissenid mussels to Canadian aquatic ecosystems. This risk assessment considered probabilities of survival (habitat suitability) and arrival to 108 Canadian sub-drainages and the ecological impacts associated with these species. The ecological risk posed by these species was decided at a workshop meeting based on a draft risk assessment using an established Risk Matrix that combines the probability of invasion and the impacts on the environment. This risk assessment provides science-based guidance to resource managers for the development and implementation of management options. This Science Advisory Report is from the Peer Review meeting on the National Risk Assessment of Zebra Mussel, Quagga Mussel and Dark Falsemussel held on March 27-28, 2012 in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Additional publications from this process, including the Research Document (Therriault et al. 2013) on which the Science Advisory Report is based, will be posted as they become available on the DFO Science Advisory Schedule at www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/csas-sccs/index-eng.htm.Original Abstract: Presentes dans les ecosystemes d'eau douce et certains ecosystemes estuariens, la moule zebree (Dreissena polymorpha) et la moule quagga (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis), qui sont toutes deux originaires de la region pontocaspienne, en Europe orientale, sont des especes envahissantes de longue date en Europe et en Amerique du Nord. Par ailleurs, l'aire de repartition d'une autre espece de moule de la famille des dreissenides, la moule d'Amerique (Mytilopsis leucopheata), s'est etendue aux habitats d'eau saumatre d'Europe et d'Amerique du Nord. En raison de leur capacite de dispersion rapide d'un continent a un autre et a l'interieur d'un meme continent, les moules dreissenidees ont eu des impacts environnementaux et socio-economiques disproportionnellement graves sur les reseaux trophiques et la transformation des elements nutritifs. Etant donne le risque considerable de repercussions negatives sur les ecosystemes canadiens que representent ces especes non indigenes et leur migration constante vers l'Ouest, plusieurs provinces de l'Ouest ont demande a Peches et Oceans Canada (par l'intermediaire du Centre d'expertise pour analyse des risques aquatiques [CEARA]) d'entreprendre une evaluation nationale du risque afin de determiner les risques potentiels poses par ces trois especes de moules dreissenidees sur les ecosystemes aquatiques au Canada. La presente evaluation des risques s'est penchee sur les probabilites de survie (habitats propices) et d'arrivee de ces especes dans 108 sousbassins versants ainsi que leurs impacts ecologiques. Les risques ecologiques poses par ces especes ont ete etablis lors d'un atelier a partir d'une evaluation preliminaire des risques et d'une matrice des risques qui combine la probabilite d'invasion et les repercussions sur l'environnement. La presente evaluation des risques fournit des conseils scientifiques aux gestionnaires pour les aider a elaborer et a mettre en uvre des options de gestion. Le present avis scientifique decoule de la reunion d'examen par les pairs du Secretariat canadien de consultation scientifique sur l'evaluation nationale des risques poses par la moule zebree, la moule quagga et la moule d'Amerique, qui s'est tenue les 27 et 28 mars 2012 a Winnipeg, au Manitoba.

AB  - In freshwater and some estuarine ecosystems, the Zebra Mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) and Quagga Mussel (D. rostriformis bugenis), both native to the Ponto-Caspian Region of Eastern Europe, have a long history of invasion in aquatic ecosystems in both Europe and North America. These two species were introduced to the Great Lakes in the mid-1980s as a result of ballast water discharge from ships. These mussels have rapidly dispersed throughout the Great Lakes region into river systems and smaller lakes. As well, a closely related dreissenid mussel species, the Dark Falsemussel (Mytilopsis leucophaeta), was identified on a boat being trailered across western Canada, raising concerns that this species could also pose a risk to Canadian freshwater ecosystems and was also evaluated in this risk assessment. Dreissenid Mussels have had significant environmental and socio-economic impacts due to their ability for rapid dispersal, resulting in severe negative impacts on food webs and nutrient processing. As a result of the significant impacts associated with these mussels as well as a steady movement west, several western provinces requested Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) (through Canada's Centre of Expertise in Risk Assessment, CEARA) to conduct a risk assessment for Zebra, Quagga and Dark FalseMussels. This risk assessment considered probabilities of survival (habitat suitability) and arrival to 108 Canadian sub-drainages and the ecological impacts associated with these species. The ecological risk posed by these species was determined using an established Risk Matrix. This risk assessment was peer reviewed as the key scientific working paper in a CSAS National Peer Review Process held on March 27 and 28, 2012 at the DFO Freshwater Institute in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The results are presented in the science advisory report and research document for this CSAS national peer review process.Original Abstract: Presentes dans les ecosystemes d'eau douce et certains ecosystemes estuariens, la moule zebree (Dreissena polymorpha) et la moule quagga (D. rostriformis bugenis), qui sont toutes deux originaires de la region pontocaspienne, en Europe orientale, sont des especes envahissantes de longue date en Europe et en Amerique du Nord. Les deux especes ont ete introduites dans les Grands Lacs vers le milieu des annees 1980 par l'entremise de l'eau de ballast deversee par les navires. Ces moules se sont rapidement dispersees dans l'ensemble de la region des Grands Lacs, dans les reseaux hydrographiques et les petits lacs. Une autre espece de moule de la famille des dreissenides, la moule d'Amerique (Mytilopsis leucophaeta), a egalement ete trouvee a bord d'un bateau qui etait remorque dans l'Ouest canadien. Cette decouverte fait craindre que cette moule presente elle aussi un risque pour les ecosystemes d'eau douce au Canada. Cette espece a egalement ete incluse dans la presente evaluation des risques. En raison de leur capacite de dispersion rapide, les moules dreissenidees ont eu des impacts environnementaux et socio-economiques importants sur les reseaux trophiques et la transformation des elements nutritifs. Etant donne les impacts importants de ces moules et leur deplacement continu vers l'Ouest, plusieurs provinces de l'Ouest ont demande a Peches et Oceans Canada (MPO) (par l'intermediaire du centre d'expertise pour l'analyse des risques aquatiques [CEARA]) d'entreprendre une evaluation du risque pour les moules zebree, quagga et d'Amerique. La presente evaluation des risques s'est penchee sur les probabilites de survie (habitats propices) et d'arrivee de ces especes dans 108 sous-bassins versants ainsi que leurs impacts ecologiques.

T1  - Submerged aquatic vegetation in the Bay of Quinte: Response to decreased phosphorous loading and Zebra Mussel invasion
AN  - 1500769207; 19064423
AB  - Originally mesotrophic, the Bay of Quinte ecosystem has experienced eutrophication since the 1940s, which resulted in the decline of once-lush submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) beds in the upper bay by the mid-1960s. Since 1972, twelve SAV surveys have been conducted along ten index transects, recording:% cover, distance SAV beds extended from shore (extent), maximum depth of colonization (Zc), species composition, and, in later years, wet plant biomass. Offshore secchi depth and Impar, (the vertical light extinction rate (ma1) for photosynthetically active radiation), were also recorded either weekly or bi-weekly during the growing season since 1972. During this time, two major changes occurred within the bay: the reduction in point-source phosphorus (P-control) loadings in 1978 and the 1993 invasion by Dreissenid Mussel. SAV response to these changes varied temporally and spatially, with the shallow upper bay showing the greatest response, particularly after Zebra Mussels establishment. In the upper bay, mean secchi depth increased by 8% from 1.2 m prior to P-control (pre-P), to 1.3 m after P-control (post-P) and further increased by 46% to 1.9 m after Dreissena establishment (post-D). Upper bay SAV responded to these invasive species with increases in the means of three variables: Zc from 1.6 to 3.5 m, extent from 114 m to 417 m and wet biomass from 50 g m2 to 962 g m2. SAV in the middle and lower bays were in better condition in 1972, with pre-P cover in excess of 50% and Zc of 2.6 and 3.7 m, respectively. SAV cover did increase in the post-D (1994 to 2007) period by approximately 25% and Zc increased to 3.7 and 6.5 m, but the narrow fringing strip of shallower water along the shore in these two deeper bays limited substantial increases in bed extent. Both water clarity and basin morphometry strongly influenced SAV distribution and abundance within the Bay of Quinte.

T1  - Inorganic elemental concentrations in water samples from Kentucky Lake, Clarks River and Ohio River: Possible effects on establishment of Zebra Mussel population.
AN  - 1468338983; 18590537
AB  - Every plant and animal species require optimum environmental conditions (Physico-chemical characteristics) to survive, reproduce and establish their population. Zebra Mussel (Dreissena polumorpha; Bivalvia, Dreissenidae) is an exotic and invasive mollusk that spread extensively over various rivers and lakes in the United States. However, these mussels did not reproduce and establish a population in the Kentucky Lake. The objective of this study was to explore various physical and chemical parameters including concentrations of dissolved Ca, Cu, Na, Mg, K, Mn and Zn in river waters that may be crucial for the reproduction and development of zebra mussels. Water samples were collected from selected locations in Kentucky Lake, Ohio River, Clarks River, Bee Creek and Hudson River, NY to delineate differences in physical and chemical parameters that support Zebra Mussels to reproduce and develop in the waters. Standard analytical procedures were followed including field sampling, sample preparation and analysis. Conventional parameters such as temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, conductivity, turbidity were measured using HYDRO Lab equipment. Dissolved inorganic trace elements were analyzed using Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometery. The temperatures in the Kentucky Lake waters ranged from 35 degree F to 95 degree F. DO (mg/L) in Kentucky Lake waters ranged from 0 to 17mg/L. The pH and conductivity in the Kentucky Lake waters ranged from 6.5 to 9.5 and 100 to 250 mu s/cm respectively. Turbidity in the Kentucky Lake waters ranged from 0 to 1400 NTU. In general, detectable concentrations of various inorganic elements were found in almost all samples analyzed. Elemental concentrations ranged from mu g L super( -1) to mg L super(-1) in depending on analyte type and sampling locations. Among the various elements analyzed calcium contained highest concentrations (Range: 7-20 mg/L) in almost all samples from the Kentucky Lake waters, where as Ohio River water samples contained Ca concentration ranging from 21-39 mg/L. The concentration of the inorganic elements in Clarks River and Bee Creek were in the similar range to that of the Kentucky Lake water samples. Copper was barely detected/below the detection limit ( Mg > Na > K > Mn > Zn > Cu. Considering the inorganic elemental concentrations in other rivers and natural lakes, the calcium levels in Kentucky Lake waters were relatively low. Based on calcium-based invasion risk assessment report, calcium level is considered low range to enable zebra mussels to establish population in the Kentucky Lake waters.

T1  - Impacts of non-native species in a shallow lake: A simulation modeling approach for restoration and management.
AN  - 1412506297; 18165942
AB  - There is a long use of models in fisheries and ecology. These models have varying assumptions of how underlying processes occur. Chapter 2 found that violating the assumption of continuous fishing could have consequences for managing harvest of fish populations. In particular, as more fish are harvested in a discrete rather than continuous fashion, parameter estimates of biomass dynamics models assuming continuous harvest can be biased. Accounting for discrete harvest using a semi-discrete biomass dynamics model reduced parameter bias and should be used when discrete harvest is occurring. Extending the exponential semi-discrete biomass dynamics model to an actual population of common carp revealed that the population was increasing. Current levels of commercial harvest were insufficient to suppress biomass. Additionally, the rate of biomass increase was rapid, doubling in approximately three years in the absences of harvest. The effect of rapid biomass increase was further demonstrated by a sensitivity analysis of the model to unintentional underharvest. Sensitivity analyses results suggest the potential for a strong fisherman effect on common carp populations. A framework to assess the minimum amount of harvest needed to maintain common carp biomass was presented. The effects of common carp and zebra mussels in aquatic food webs investigated in Chapter 4 revealed a potential impediment to lake restoration. In particular, zooplankton predation by age 0 yellow bass may limit top down regulation of phytoplankton biomass. Based on mass-balance estimates, age 0 yellow bass were estimated to consumer up to 50% of zooplankton production. The recent invasion of zebra mussel was shown to have an effect on phytoplankton populations, likely compensating for reduced zooplankton abundance. Common carp food web impacts were lower than expected, due to abundant benthic food resources. The potential common carp and zebra mussel ecosystem impacts in the context of ongoing restoration were evaluated in Chapter 5. Simulated changes in common carp biomass had dramatic effects on water quality and recreational fishery yield. This effect was due to increased suspended sediment reducing water transparency, which in turn limited phytoplankton production. This also limited any effect of zebra mussels on water quality by limiting food resources (i.e., edible phytoplankton). In scenarios simulating baseline common carp biomass, increasing or decreasing zebra mussel biomass had positive and negative effects on water transparency respectively. Overall, zebra mussel impacts, positive or negative were limited to baseline common carp biomass scenario classes. Additionally, macrophytes biomass showed a dramatic increase when commercial fishing increased in scenarios of baseline common carp biomass, however this may lead to nuisance levels. Unexpectedly, macrophyte increases in response to increased commercial fishing mortality also stimulated common carp increases as an increased food resource. This in turn reduced simulated water clarity and macrophyte biomass. Results of this study suggest that in-lake processes are a significant component to water quality and recreational fishery yield. Controlling common carp biomass will critical to achieve water quality goals and minimize adverse effects on recreational fishery yield. The recent invasion of zebra mussels to the system will likely positively affect water clarity; however this will be limited by common carp. With common carp biomass controlled, zebra mussels can be expected to clear the water column; however this will reduce pelagic primary production, and require consumers to shift to feeding within benthic food web portions.

T1  - Physical and chemical properties determine zebra mussel invasion success in lakes
AN  - 866983535
AB  - To address the question whether the abundance of an invasive species can be explained by physical and chemical properties of the invaded ecosystems, we gathered density data of invasive zebra mussels and the physical and chemical data of ecosystems they invaded. We assembled published data from 55 European and 13 North American lakes and developed a model for zebra mussel density using a generalized additive model (GAM) approach. Our model revealed that the joint effect of surface area, total phosphorus and calcium concentrations explained 62% of the variation in Dreissena density. Our study indicates that large and less productive North American lakes can support larger local populations of zebra mussels. Our results suggest that the proliferation of an exotic species in an area can partially be explained by physical and chemical properties of the recipient environment.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - A standardized design for quagga mussel monitoring in Lake Mead, Nevada-Arizona
AN  - 968183809; 16502674
AB  - The discovery of quagga mussels (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) in Lake Mead, Nevada-Arizona, on January 6, 2007 is the first known occurrence of dreissenid species in the western United States. This study developed elements of a cost-effective and standardized quagga mussel-monitoring program for Lake Mead using preliminary data to arrive at statistically based numbers of sampling sites. To represent the abundance of adult/juvenile quagga mussels in Lake Mead's heterogeneous floor with 95% confidence, a stratified simple random sampling design revealed a requirement of 41 samples from hard substrates (i.e., rocky areas) and 97 samples from soft substrates (i.e., sandy and muddy areas). A simple random sampling design demonstrated that 42 samples from the lake's water column are necessary to represent veliger abundance with 95% confidence. Other important elements of the sampling program, such as standardization of protocols and processes and suggested data analyses, are discussed. The monitoring program, which is based on reconnaissance data, is intended to be optimized with data from its first year's samples. The sample number-selection approach and the other elements of this plan can be easily implemented by lake managers and can also be adapted to other locations where dreissenid mussel monitoring is needed.

T1  - Habitat suitability of patch types: A case study of the Yosemite toad
AN  - 877956676
AB  - Understanding patch variability is crucial in understanding the spatial population structure of wildlife species, especially for rare or threatened species. We used a well-tested maximum entropy species distribution model (Maxent) to map the Yosemite toad (Anaxyrus (= Bufo) canorus) in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California. Twenty-six environmental variables were included in the model representing climate, topography, land cover type, and disturbance factors (e.g., distances to agricultural lands, fire perimeters, and timber harvest areas) throughout the historic range of the toad. We then took a novel approach to the study of spatially structured populations by applying the species-environmental matching model separately for 49 consistently occupied sites of the Yosemite toad compared to 27 intermittently occupied sites. We found that the distribution of the entire population was highly predictable (AUC = 0.95±0.03 SD), and associated with low slopes, specific vegetation types (wet meadow, alpine-dwarf shrub, montane chaparral, red fir, and subalpine conifer), and warm temperatures. The consistently occupied sites were also associated with these same factors, and they were also highly predictable (AUC = 0.95±0.05 SD). However, the intermittently occupied sites were associated with distance to fire perimeter, a slightly different response to vegetation types, distance to timber harvests, and a much broader set of aspect classes (AUC = 0.90±0.11 SD). We conclude that many studies of species distributions may benefit by modeling spatially structured populations separately. Modeling and monitoring consistently-occupied sites may provide a realistic snapshot of current species-environment relationships, important climatic and topographic patterns associated with species persistence patterns, and an understanding of the plasticity of the species to respond to varying climate regimes across its range. Meanwhile, modeling and monitoring of widely dispersing individuals and intermittently occupied sites may uncover environmental thresholds and human-related threats to population persistence.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Differences in growth and survivorship of zebra and quagga mussels: size matters
AN  - 869904347
AB  - Issue Title: A Passion for Plankton: a tribute to the life of Stanley Dodson / Guest Editors: H.J. Dumont, J.E. Havel, R. Gulati & P. Spaak

              
The zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) and its congener the quagga mussel (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) are both invaders in freshwater, but have very different invasion histories, with zebra mussels attaining substantially faster rates of spread at virtually all spatial scales. However, in waterbodies where they co-occur, D. r. bugensis can displace D. polymorpha. To determine if the mechanisms for this displacement are associated with different survival and growth, we kept mussels in flow-through tanks for 289 days with two temperature regimes that mimicked the natural surface water (littoral zone) and hypolimnion conditions of Lake Erie. For the littoral zone regime, we used water directly from the surface of Lake Erie (range 4-25°C, average 11.9 ± 0.6°C). For the profundal zone treatment, Lake Erie surface water was chilled to about 6°C (range 5-8°C, average 6.2 ± 0.6°C) for the full duration of the experiment. For each of these temperature regimes, we used three replicate tanks with only zebra mussels present and three replicate tanks with only quagga mussels (150 ind./tank each), and three replicate tanks with both species (75 ind./tank of each species). Quagga mussels had higher survivorship and grew more than zebra mussels in all treatments. For both species, the size of the mussel entering the winter was critical for survivorship. Larger mussels had a higher survival over the winter in all treatments. For both species, there was a survivorship and growth tradeoff. In the warmer littoral zone treatment both species had higher growth, but lower survival than in the colder profundal zone treatment. Surprisingly, although quagga mussels outperformed zebra mussels, zebra mussel survivorship was better when they were faced with competition by quagga mussels than with just intraspecific competition. In addition, quagga mussels suffered size-specific mortality during the growing season only when facing interspecific competition with zebra mussels. Further experiments are needed to determine the possible mechanisms for these interspecific effects.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The invasive dark falsemussel Mytilopsis leucophaeata (Bivalvia: Dreissenidae): a literature review
AN  - 861139985
AB  - This paper reviews literature from the Americas and Europe on the dark falsemussel Mytilopsis leucophaeata (Conrad in J Acad Nat Sci Phila 6(2):256-268, 1831), including data collected in its native habitat in the Americas that appear as incidental information in published reports. Mytilopsis leucophaeata is a poorly studied dreissenid bivalve that is native to mainly oligohaline-mesohaline regions of estuaries in North America. In its native habitat, it usually occurs in very low numbers and has rarely been mentioned in field survey reports. However, occasionally in its native habitat and often in habitats where it has been introduced (as in Europe and Brazil), it may undergo population irruptions for no clear reason. This review describes habitat characteristics, environmental tolerances, and biological and ecological attributes of the species. The assembled information reveals the species to be euryhaline and eurythermal, with an unexplained ability to persist in its native estuaries even though it is relatively short-lived and usually uncommon.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Long-term changes in a population of an invasive bivalve and its effects
AN  - 856954364; 20922431
AB  - Although the ecological and economic effects of non-native species probably often change through time, few studies have documented such effects. The zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) is an important invader that has had large ecological and economic effects on the ecosystems it has invaded in North America and western Europe. Our 20-year study of the Hudson River, New York, showed that the characteristics of a zebra mussel population and its effects on other benthic animals both changed substantially through time. Over the period of study, annual survivorship of adult zebra mussels fell >100-fold, which caused the aggregate filtration rate of the population to fall by 82%. Population size and body size of zebra mussels may also have fallen. In the early years of the invasion, densities of nearly all benthic animals in deepwater sites fell steeply (by 80-99%). After about 8 years of decline, these populations began to recover, and are approaching pre-invasion densities. The littoral zoobenthos showed neither the initial decline nor the subsequent recovery. Although the mechanisms behind these changes are not fully clear, our study shows that the effects of an invader may change considerably over time.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Hydrologic controls and anthropogenic drivers of the zebra mussel invasion of the Mississippi-Missouri river system
AN  - 863964679
AB  - We propose a novel ecohydrological model for the invasion of inland waters by the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha and test it against field data gathered within the Mississippi-Missouri river system in North America. This biological invasion poses major ecological and economic threats, especially due to the huge population densities reached by local zebra mussel colonies and the species' unparalleled dispersal abilities within fluvial systems. We focus on a quantitative evaluation, attempted here for the first time, of the individual roles and the mutual interactions of drivers and controls of the Mississippi-Missouri invasion. To this end, we use a multilayer network model accounting explicitly for zebra mussel demographic dynamics, hydrologic transport, and dispersal due to anthropic activities. By testing our results against observations, we show that hydrologic transport alone is not sufficient to explain the spread of the species at the basin scale. We also quantify the role played by commercial navigation in promoting the initial, selective colonization of the river system, and show how recreational boating may have determined the capillary penetration of the species into the water system. The role of post-establishment dispersal mechanisms and the effectiveness of possible prevention measures are also discussed in the context of model sensitivity and robustness to reparametrization.

T1  - Resistance of the invasive pest mussel Limnoperna fortunei to anoxia: Implications for biofouling control
AN  - 860385064; 14539929
AB  - Invasive mussels cause significant problems in water bodies--and for water utilities. The golden mussel Limnoperna fortunei-- like its zebra and quagga mussel cousins--has serious environmental and ecologic effects on the habitats it invades. Native to Asia, the bivalve was likely introduced in South America by transocean ships in the early 1990s. First detected in Argentina along the coasts of the Rio de la Plata Estuary, L. fortunei spread westward and northward and has reached as far north as Brazil into the Pantanal, the world's largest wetland. In this study, small (7-mm) and large (20-mm) mussels were exposed to anoxic conditions under two temperatures (20 and 27 degree C). The authors found that in industrial installations, regardless of its physiologic effect (which was not studied), anoxia is an economic, effective, and environmentally innocuous alternative for the control of L. fortunei. Although this mussel is more resistant than Dreissena polymorpha at higher temperatures, this study did show that 100% mortalities can be achieved in slightly more than a week. Other researchers have predicted that L. fortunei's ability to tolerate conditions that limit other mussels could help promote its spread into the drainage systems of three rivers in North America: the Rio Grande, the Colorado, and the Mississippi.

T1  - Acute Upper Thermal Limits of Three Aquatic Invasive Invertebrates: Hot Water Treatment to Prevent Upstream Transport of Invasive Species
AN  - 853485607; 14168042
AB  - Transport of aquatic invasive species (AIS) by boats traveling up rivers and streams is an important mechanism of secondary spread of AIS into watersheds. Because physical barriers to AIS movement also prevent navigation, alternate methods for preventing spread are necessary while allowing upstream navigation. One promising approach is to lift boats over physical barriers and then use hot water immersion to kill AIS attached to the hull, motor, or fishing gear. However, few data have been published on the acute upper thermal tolerance limits of potential invaders treated in this manner. To test the potential effectiveness of this approach for a planned boat lift on the Fox River of northeastern WI, USA, acute upper thermal limits were determined for three AIS, adult zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha), quagga mussels (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis), and spiny water fleas (Bythotrephes longimanus) from the local area employing temperatures from 32 to 54 degree C and immersion times from 1 to 20min. Mortality was determined after immersion followed by a 20-min recovery period. Immersion at 43 degree C for at least 5min was required to ensure 100% mortality for all three species, but due to variability in the response by Bythotrephes a 10min immersion would be more reliable. Overall there were no significant differences between the three species in acute upper thermal limits. Heated water can be an efficient, environmentally sound, and cost effective method of controlling AIS potentially transferred by boats, and our results should have both specific and wide-ranging applications in the prevention of the spread of aquatic invasive species.

T1  - Predation by the invasive American signal crayfish, Pacifastacus leniusculus Dana, on the invasive zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha Pallas: the potential for control and facilitation
AN  - 809053237
AB  - Non-indigenous crayfish often have major ecological impacts on invaded water bodies, and have contributed to the decline of native crayfish species throughout Europe. The American signal crayfish, Pacifastacus leniusculus, is the most widespread invasive crayfish in Great Britain, where the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, is similarly an invasive pest species. The potential for the American signal crayfish to regulate zebra mussel populations was investigated through a series of laboratory experiments. Crayfish were found to be highly size selective, consuming significantly more of the smallest size class of zebra mussels offered (7-12 mm), over medium (16-21 mm) and large (25-30 mm). Crayfish feeding rate on zebra mussels was not altered when mussels were presented clumped together in natural druses compared with mussels in a disassembled druse. Crayfish spent significantly more time foraging when mussels were unattached, and a greater proportion of attacks were on medium and large than on small mussels (83% of attacks were on medium and large mussels when unattached as opposed to 47% when on druses). Individual crayfish feeding rate decreased significantly at densities of > ~5 crayfish m^sup -2^. Signal crayfish are, therefore, unlikely to be able to significantly impact established populations of zebra mussels in the wild, although zebra mussels have the potential to provide crayfish with a substantial food source.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Characterizing zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) condition, populations, and community effects in Oklahoma habitats.
AN  - 1367493238; 18089267
AB  - Scope and Method of Study: Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha ) are one of the most widely recognized aquatic invasive species in North America. Their negative effects on native species, ecosystems, and industry have been widely documented within the scientific literature, yet their ultimate distribution is still widely debated. As Oklahoma was initially considered their southern distributional limits due to warm summer water temperatures, an evaluation of their population characteristics, growth and physiological condition within Oklahoma's reservoirs may provide insight into the potential for infestations further south. This study sought to characterize D. polymorpha density and reproduction in several Oklahoma reservoirs, assess their physiological condition on a seasonal scale, and determine if they have had a negative effect on native mussel communities in the Verdigris River. Findings and Conclusions: An 8-year study at Oologah Lake, OK revealed peak zebra mussel densities near 150,000/m super(2) within 2 years of discovery, however during 2006 a dieoff associated with 30 degree C water temperatures and flooding events in subsequent years reduced these densities significantly. Native mussel surveys within the Verdigris River suggested there had been no significant decline in richness or abundance of native species since introduction of the zebra mussel, however reductions may still occur in the future particularly if zebra mussel densities remain high for several consecutive years. Similar zebra mussel densities were observed in Sooner Lake, OK, during a 4-year study despite an altered thermal regime in that system. Summer dieoffs of reproductively mature zebra mussels were recorded, however the population was able to recover in each subsequent year driven by young of the year mussels, perhaps better able to tolerate warm summer water temperatures. Multiple condition indices revealed D. polymorpha are in poorest physiological condition during July and August and are in best condition in May and June. Thermal tolerance bioassays indicated zebra mussels in Oklahoma have not developed any enhanced upper thermal tolerance and exhibit similar oxygen consumption and ammonia excretion ratios as compared with mussels from more northern populations.

T1  - Evaluating the role of exotic dreissenid mussels in the disappearance of the benthic amphipod Diporeia spp. In the Laurentian Great Lakes.
AN  - 1221145589; 17298646
AB  - The burrowing amphipod Diporeia spp. has historically been the dominant macroinvertebrate and a high quality prey item for fish in benthic habitats of deep freshwater lakes of North America. In the mid-1990s, Diporeia populations began to decline in many of the Laurentian Great Lakes as exotic zebra and quagga mussels (Dreissena spp.) expanded after introduction from eastern Europe via transoceanic shipping. By 2010, this Great Lakes ecosystem health indicator had disappeared from vast areas of benthic habitat 30 m, suggesting that remote ecosystem disruption by shallow mussels played a role. Diporeia populations in the Finger Lakes coexist with dreissenid mussels and represent a key anomaly to the pattern of decline seen in the Great Lakes. The experimental component of this study evaluated the pathogen and food limitation hypotheses by exposing Diporeia to dreissenids in controlled laboratory conditions. Short-term (28-day) exposures using different combinations of Diporeia and quagga mussel populations did not indicate that quagga mussel populations from Great Lakes or Finger Lakes carry pathogens or toxins harmful to Diporeia. Longer-term (90-day) exposures suggest that the direct presence of dreissenids can actually benefit Diporeia leading to weight gain and higher fecundity relative to no-mussel controls. Diporeia may utilize biodeposits or periphyton associated with quagga mussels. A feeding trial with terrestrial organic matter (partially decomposed leaf litter), an alternative food source available in Cayuga Lake, also led to weight gain for Diporeia although survival was low. Fatty acid tracers, particularly the monounsaturate palmitoleic acid (16:1w7), were useful for assessing the dietary role of diatoms for Diporeia. The findings of my dissertation suggest that dreissenids may not have initiated the Diporeia decline. However, the continued expansion of dreissenid mussels in lakes Michigan, Huron, and Ontario is driving ecosystem disruptions including the disappearance of the spring diatom bloom that have major ramifications for the survival of remnant profundal populations of Diporeia.

T1  - Characterizing zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) condition, populations, and community effects in Oklahoma habitats.
AN  - 1011207003; 16534541
AB  - Scope and Method of Study: Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha ) are one of the most widely recognized aquatic invasive species in North America. Their negative effects on native species, ecosystems, and industry have been widely documented within the scientific literature, yet their ultimate distribution is still widely debated. As Oklahoma was initially considered their southern distributional limits due to warm summer water temperatures, an evaluation of their population characteristics, growth and physiological condition within Oklahoma's reservoirs may provide insight into the potential for infestations further south. This study sought to characterize D. polymorpha density and reproduction in several Oklahoma reservoirs, assess their physiological condition on a seasonal scale, and determine if they have had a negative effect on native mussel communities in the Verdigris River. Findings and Conclusions: An 8-year study at Oologah Lake, OK revealed peak zebra mussel densities near 150,000/m super(2) within 2 years of discovery, however during 2006 a dieoff associated with 30 degree C water temperatures and flooding events in subsequent years reduced these densities significantly. Native mussel surveys within the Verdigris River suggested there had been no significant decline in richness or abundance of native species since introduction of the zebra mussel, however reductions may still occur in the future particularly if zebra mussel densities remain high for several consecutive years. Similar zebra mussel densities were observed in Sooner Lake, OK, during a 4-year study despite an altered thermal regime in that system. Summer dieoffs of reproductively mature zebra mussels were recorded, however the population was able to recover in each subsequent year driven by young of the year mussels, perhaps better able to tolerate warm summer water temperatures. Multiple condition indices revealed D. polymorpha are in poorest physiological condition during July and August and are in best condition in May and June. Thermal tolerance bioassays indicated zebra mussels in Oklahoma have not developed any enhanced upper thermal tolerance and exhibit similar oxygen consumption and ammonia excretion ratios as compared with mussels from more northern populations.

T1  - The biological pathway and effect of PCBs on common terns in Lake Michigan
AN  - 807571092; 20725777
AB  - Poly-chlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have been recognized as a significant contaminant in the Great Lakes ecosystem. Although PCBs are implicated in the reduced survival and reproductive success of several piscivorous bird species, the biological pathway in which PCBs bioaccumulate remains largely unknown. This study investigates the two most likely biological pathways, suggested via research on Great Lakes sport fish, by which PCBs would be acquired by common terns (Sterna hirundo), a piscivorous species of conservation concern. The first proposed pathway is through atmospheric deposition of PCBs which are subsequently acquired by filter-feeding fish (e.g., alewives, Alosa pseudoharengus). An alternative pathway is via the biodeposits of zebra mussels which are consumed by shallow water fish (e.g., round gobies, Neogobius melanostromus). Because common terns breed in near-shore sites where concentrations of zebra mussels are found, as well as forage in more pelagic environments it is possible that either or both pathways may be contributing to their PCB exposure. Field experiments and stable isotope analyses suggest the most likely pathway by which terns are exposed to PCBs is via alewives, similar to how apex predators such as lake trout acquire PCBs. Biodeposits from zebra mussels do not appear to be a significant factor in PCB accumulation in terns. We quantified extremely poor parental attentiveness during incubation. Although we cannot determine whether poor parental attentiveness alone or in combination with PCB contamination led to low hatching success, accumulation of PCBs appears to have significant impacts on the overall reproductive success of common terns.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Long-Term and Recent Changes in Southern Lake Michigan Water Quality with Implications for Present Trophic Status
AN  - 853483293; 14135611
AB  - Southern Lake Michigan has changed in response to alterations in nutrients and invasive species. NOAA and EPA monitoring results are used to examine those changes. NOAA provides detailed seasonal resolution, but limited spatial coverage, whereas the EPA provides more spatial coverage, but limited seasonal resolution. We compare changes in total phosphorus (TP), silica, nitrate plus nitrite, and chlorophyll concentrations from before and after the invasion by the quagga mussel (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis). Although TP at NOAA stations was consistently higher than at EPA stations, both confirm declines in spring and summer surface mixed layer (SML) conditions. Chlorophyll differed at EPA and NOAA stations before quagga mussel invasion, but not after the invasion. Spring chlorophyll decreased at NOAA stations after the invasion, but summer conditions did not change at either set of stations. Pre-invasion silica at NOAA stations was slightly higher than at EPA stations, and the lake's Si reservoir increased over the study period. Basin-scale spring Si increased gradually, whereas summer SML Si increased dramatically after 2003, likely reflecting reduced diatom production. Basin-scale nitrate increased significantly from pre- to post-invasion in both spring and summer. Summer nitrate utilization declined drastically in recent years, likely reflecting reduced phytoplankton production. TP loads decreased; however, the timing of changes in chlorophyll and Si and nitrate utilization suggest the recent increase in dreissenid filtering dramatically reduced spring phytoplankton abundance and production across the entire southern basin. The offshore pelagic zone of the historically mesotrophic southern Lake Michigan is now similar to oligotrophic Lake Superior.

T1  - Is Gammarus tigrinus (Crustacea, Amphipoda) becoming cosmopolitan through shipping? Predicting its potential invasive range using ecological niche modeling
AN  - 288487802
AB  - While the intensity of global shipping has increased dramatically over the last decades, species exchange between continents has likewise intensified. Ballast water of ships is recognized playing a major role in this process. Many of the larger sea ports have become bridgeheads for invasions. Ecological niche modeling is used to investigate the potential invasive range and high invasive risk ports of the North American amphipod Gammarus tigrinus. Sixty-two occurrences of G. tigrinus in its native range (North America) and 34 environmental data sets were compiled. Data on dispersal distances were used via ecological niche modeling to analyze the invasive potential of G. tigrinus. The invasive risk of large ports was analyzed according to modeling result, as well as their salinity in the main oceanic routes of the world. G. tigrinus had a rapid range extension on the British Isles and in the rest of Western Europe. Now it is invading the countries surrounding the Baltic Sea. Worldwide it has a vast potential invasive range. It has a high invasive risk for many large ports along the main oceanic routes, among which the ports of Shanghai, Buenos Aires and Montevideo have the highest invasive risk. G. tigrinus may become cosmopolitan through shipping, and this possibility is increasing. Particular emphasis should be placed on preventing human-mediated dispersal. Ports may be the first places G. tigrinus invades. This study can identify high invasive risk ports, especially those at risk of introduced North America species. More importantly, the water of large ports should be monitored regularly for exotic aquatic organisms that may survive temporarily or permanently.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - A risk-based decision model and risk assessment of invasive mussels
AN  - 815534906; 13663775
AB  - Ecological risks and economical impacts of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) include alterations in the transfer of energy and cycling of materials in aquatic systems, increased accumulation of contaminants in aquatic food chains, clogging of water intakes, and damage to related infrastructure. A risk-based decision model was developed to assess the likelihood of zebra mussel invasion and establishment throughout the St. Croix Basin. The risk-based decision model CASMZM is a version of the comprehensive aquatic systems model (CASM) and that was modified to simulate the growth, reproduction, and spatial distribution of zebra mussels. As a risk management tool, the model simulates the population dynamical complexity of zebra mussel populations, as well as their impacts on phytoplankton, zooplankton, benthic invertebrates, fish and natural mussel populations. The CASMZM is based in part on a set of zebra mussel's physical-chemical habitat requirements such as calcium concentration (17mg/L), total hardness (57.5mg/L), conductivity (6 mu S/cm), dissolved oxygen concentration (6mg/L), salinity (7PSU), pH (6.8 and 9.4), Secchi disk depths (75 and 205cm), and water temperatures for growth (14 degree C) and reproduction (30 degree C). The CASMZM also includes a bioenergetics framework that describes the growth of zebra mussels and their trophic impacts on aquatic food webs. The CASMZM can be used to forecast the risk of successful dreissenid invasions and assess the associated impacts of invasive mussels on food web dynamics of previously uninfested aquatic systems throughout the St. Croix Basin.

T1  - Forecasting the expansion of the invasive golden mussel Limnopernafortunei in Brazilian and North American rivers based on its occurrence in the Paraguay River and Pantanal wetland of Brazil
AN  - 968183685; 16502740
AB  - The bivalve Limnopernafortunei (Dunker, 1857), also called golden mussel, is native to Asia but becoming dispersed around the world. The golden mussel resembles the invasive dreissenid bivalves in many respects, and although much less studied it evidently has broader environmental tolerances. The golden mussel was introduced into the La Plata River estuary (South America) and quickly expanded upstream to the north, into the tropical Paraguay River reaching a large floodplain area in Brazil known as the Pantanal wetland. The golden mussel tolerates environmental conditions in the Pantanal that would be inhospitable for most bivalves, but mussel mortality has been observed during the most extreme oxygen depletion events. Based on knowledge about the limiting factors for the golden mussel in the Pantanal wetland, its potential distribution was predicted for the remainder of the Paraguay River basin where the species is not present, as well as in other river systems throughout Brazil. Forecasts of potential distribution in Brazilian river systems were based on physicochemical limitations for shell calcification, and specifically on lower thresholds of dissolved calcium concentrations and the calcium carbonate (calcite) index of saturation, which may be a better indicator of calcification potential in low-calcium waters than calcium concentration alone. In addition to examining spatial patterns in calcium and calcification potential, these and other limnological and climate variables were used in ecological niche modeling using GARP and Maxent algorithms. Forecasts of potential distributions in three major North American river systems (Mississippi, Colorado, and Rio Grande) were based mainly on water temperature because calcium availability and calcification evidently would not be limiting to golden mussel establishment in those waters. Due to the greater tolerance of the golden mussel to conditions known to limit other bivalves, as well as its greater ability for shell calcification in low-calcium water, the golden mussel could potentially become broadly distributed throughout Brazil. According to its thermal tolerance L. fortunei could become established in the Mississippi, Colorado and Rio Grande drainage systems, although the northern Mississippi River system including the Missouri River may be too cool in the winter to support the golden mussel.

T1  - Stoichiometry in a benthic invasive: Exploring how stoichiometric imbalances with algal resources affect zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) growth and condition.
AN  - 856771526; 14189816
AB  - Scope and Method of Study. Ecological Stoichiometry has become a new framework to describe interactions in many different habitats. In this research, I used stoichiometry to examine the effects of food quality and quantity on zebra mussel growth and condition. This study took place in 60, 1L microcosms under controlled laboratory conditions. Zebra mussels were fed Scenedesmus sp. at two food quantities (1mg C L super( -1) and 4mg C L super(-1)) and two food qualities (C:P ratios 20 and 45). These food quality treatments were selected to represent very low C:P ratios to represent C:P ratios that are found in eutrophic systems across North America. Treatments were crossed to make 4 total treatments; 20-1, 20-4, 45-1, and 45-4. Findings and Conclusions. Zebra mussel shell growth was not affected by algal quality or quantity. However, dry tissue mass and Tissue Condition Index (TCI) were significantly lower in the lower C:P ratio treatments (20-1, 20-4) when compared to the higher C:P ratio treatments (45-1, 45-4). Significantly more ammonia and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) were also excreted in the lower C:P ratio treatments than in the higher C:P ratio treatments. There were no food quantity effects on growth, TCI, or excretion, but there was a significant interaction between food quality and food quantity for TCI and excretion in the 45-4 treatment, with TCI being the greatest and excretion being the lowest between all treatments. Combined, these results show that despite enhanced excretion of excessive nutrients, there were significant growth and condition penalties at the lower C:P treatments, clearly indicating toxic effects of excess dietary P. Zebra mussels were also able to adjust their tissue stoichiometry based on food quality to a certain point, but were not able to benefit from the excess P in the food resources. Therefore, the response of consumers to stoichiometric imbalances is driven by not only when nutrients are limiting but also when nutrients are in excess, and should be considered especially under rapid cultural eutrophication. With respect to zebra mussel invasions, there may be stoichiometric limitations in eutrophic and hyper-eutrophic systems that do not allow zebra mussels to have the same effect as seen in other systems.

T1  - Profiling ecosystem vulnerability to invasion by zebra mussels with support vector machines
AN  - 21291299; 11893554
AB  - Decades since the initial establishment of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) in North America, understanding and controlling the invasion of aquatic ecosystems continues to be a problem in continent-wide conservation and landscape management. While the high economic and conservation burden of this species makes accurate predictions of future invasions a research priority, forecasting is confounded by limited data, tenuous model assumptions, and the stochasticity of the invasion process. Using a new method for niche identification, we profiled invasion vulnerability for 1,017 lakes in the Great Lakes region of the Unites States. We used a nonparametric geoadditive regression model to test for effects of two water quality variables on the present distribution of zebra mussels. We then used the support vector data description (SVDD), a support vector machine for one-class classification, to estimate the boundary of the ecological niche. By disentangling niche estimation from distributional assumptions, computational niche models could be used to test an array of fundamental concepts in ecology and evolution, while species invasions forecasting is representative of the wide range of potential applications for niche identification in conservation and management.

T1  - Colonisation by Dreissena of Great Lakes coastal ecosystems: how suitable are wetlands?
AN  - 21071210; 11208742
AB  - Summary1. Invasive zebra (Dreissena polymorpha) and quagga mussels (Dreissena bugensis) have become widespread throughout the Great Lakes basin. However, some types of Great Lakes coastal wetlands may be unsuitable for Dreissena invasion.2. To test this observation, artificial substrata were placed in wetlands (with emergent vegetation) and in adjacent open water (without emergent vegetation) habitats in two types of Great Lakes coastal ecosystems: drowned river mouth (DRM) and coastal fringing systems. Wetlands in DRM systems generally have deep organic sediment and limited water movement, whereas coastal fringing wetlands generally have low to moderate amounts of organic sediment and intense wind and wave action.3. We did not find a significant difference in Dreissena colonisation between wetlands and adjacent open water habitat in fringing systems. However, Dreissena colonisation was significantly lower in DRM wetlands than in the adjacent open water. We also found significantly lower survival in DRM wetlands than adjacent open water habitats, whereas survival did not differ significantly in coastal fringing wetlands and the adjacent open water.4. Our results suggest that vulnerability to Dreissena invasion varied among wetland types with DRM wetlands being less suitable than fringing wetlands. We suggest that colonisation and survival of Dreissena is lower in wetlands with deep organic sediment and less turbulent water.

T1  - Eradication of colonizing populations of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) by early detection and SCUBA removal: Lake George, NY
AN  - 21074206; 11133210
AB  - 1. Since their introduction to North America, zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) and quagga mussels (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) have rapidly colonized North American fresh waters. Strategies for limiting the economic and ecological impacts of zebra mussels exist, but there are few examples where once zebra mussels have invaded a natural body of water they have been removed or managed without the use of ecologically destructive methods. The first successful attempt to eradicate a colonizing population of zebra mussels using SCUBA is reported here. Studies were conducted in Lake George, NY. 2. Since zebra mussel larvae had been detected prior to the discovery of adults in Lake George, a comprehensive management programme for zebra mussels was in place when mussels were found in 1999, at a single location in the southern part of the Lake (Lake George Village site). Efforts were quickly launched to remove as many mussels as possible by SCUBA with the intent of minimizing the risk of the population reproducing and establishing a permanent presence in the Lake. 3. Population size at the discovery site was initially estimated at fewer than 30000 animals. Between 1999 and 2007 more than 21000 animals were removed from the site, over 90% of them shortly after the colony was discovered. Continued monitoring of the site for larvae, recruitment, and growth suggests that the animals have not successfully reproduced since the project began. Since detection at the Lake George Village site, six separate colonizing populations at other locations in the lake were found and similar removal efforts appear to be having comparable success. 4. This study demonstrates that the combination of early detection, suboptimal habitat, proactive establishment of a rapid response and management plan, and cooperation of a comprehensive network of stakeholders can prevent a successful zebra mussel invasion.

T1  - THE STATE OF LAKE ERIE IN 2004
AN  - 2101794210
AB  - The state of the lake of Lake Erie in 2004 is examined. The state of Lake Erie is improving in some areas. Substantial attention has been paid to issues such as habitat, managing for sustainable fisheries, and lake trout rehabilitation, even though more needs to be done. What is clear from all quarters is that enhancing the lake's productive capacity and understanding how change impacts productive capacity will require cooperation and coordination across disciplines and among agencies, institutions, and stakeholders. To that end, while walleye and yellow perch continue to be managed by an interagency quota system, other warm- and cool-water species such as white bass, white perch (Morone americana), channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), freshwater drum (Aplodinotus grunniens) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio) are harvested by jurisdictions without an interagency management protocol, a change that likely should be made. Other issues facing the health of warm- and cool-water species include expansion of aquatic nuisance species, increased exploitation, inconsistent recruitment, increased pathogens and parasites (including sea lamprey), and loss of habitat due to human-induced effects, including changes in water levels, climate, nutrient input, and contaminant loading.

T1  - Characteristics of a refuge for native freshwater mussels (Bivalvia: Unionidae) in Lake St. Clair
AN  - 20522190; 9198016
AB  - The Lake St. Clair delta (6 100 km super(2)) provides an important refuge for native freshwater mussels (Unionidae) wherein 22 of the 6 35 historical species co-occur with invasive dreissenids. A total of 1875 live unionids representing 22 species were found during snorkeling surveys of 32 shallow (6 1 m) sites throughout the delta. Richness and density of unionids and zebra mussel infestation rates varied among sites from 3 to 13 unionid species, 0.02 to 0.12 unionids/m super(2), and < 1 to 35 zebra mussels/unionid, respectively. Zebra mussel infestation of unionids in the delta appears to be mitigated by dominant offshore currents, which limit densities of zebra mussel veligers in nearshore compared to offshore waters (13,600 vs. 28,000/m super(3), respectively). Glycogen concentrations in the tissues of a common and widespread species in the delta (Lampsilis siliquoidea) suggest that zebra mussels may be adversely affecting physiological condition of unionids in a portion of the Lake St. Clair delta. Physiological condition and community structure of unionids within the delta may also be influenced by differences in food quantity and quality resulting from the uneven distribution of water flowing from the St. Clair River. The delta likely supports the largest living unionid community in the lower Great Lakes and includes several species that have been listed as Endangered or Threatened in Canada and/or the state of Michigan, making it an important refuge for the conservation of native unionids.

T1  - Patterns of biodiversity and co-occurrence of native and nonindigenous species at Great Lakes coastal margins.
AN  - 1020849857; 16785096
AB  - Studies that assess the ecological processes that allow establishment by a nonindigenous species in the Laurentian Great Lakes can help elucidate general ecological processes. The Great Lakes has such varied habitats that observations of any general patterns in ecological processes, involving both native species and nonindigenous species, likely pertain elsewhere. Studies relating biotic interactions and interaction-neutral processes to invasibility are numerous, but they have been largely inconclusive. This thesis evaluates hypotheses linking biotic interaction (i.e., richness, evenness, and dominance) and neutral-interaction (i.e., dispersal/propagule pressure) processes of several taxonomic groups (birds, diatoms, fishes, macroinvertebrates, and wetland vegetation) to invasibility at various spatial scales and sample sizes. These hypotheses were assessed using synoptic sample collections from various locations throughout the US Laurentian Great Lakes coastal margins influenced by varying types and levels of anthropogenic disturbance. I tested hypotheses relating biotic resistance versus habitat suitability to invasion by a nonindigenous amphipod. Results supported the view that biotic facilitation by dreissenid mussels and distribution of suitable habitats better explain the distribution of the nonindigenous amphipod than anthropogenic disturbance and biotic resistance. I evaluated hypotheses relating richness, evenness, and relative species dominance to invasibility and the occurrence of native and nonindigenous species using data compiled for various taxonomic groups from several hundred locations along the US coastline of the Laurentian Great Lakes. Across taxonomic groups, trends of native and nonindigenous species distributions were inconsistent with regulation by biotic interaction related processes. Regulation by neutral processes, such as propagule pressure or habitat suitability may better explain patterns. Native species distributions were correlated with habitat suitability and habitat hydrogeomorphology, and ranges reflect biogeographic history. The factors that constrain nonindigenous species are arguably a variation of those that constrain native species distributions, thus indicating that similar factors constrain both native and nonindigenous species. The general accuracy of these synoptic findings was assessed by comparing biodiversity estimation performance of data resulting from intensive sampling protocols. A method proposed by Olszewski (2004), which is alternative to rarefaction and statistical estimators for species richness, was also tested. This method uses the evenness component of biodiversity and requires a limited number of samples for estimations. My findings indicated that true biodiversity measures cannot be attained efficiently from surveys. Since such measures are unattainable, interpretation of biodiversity studies would benefit from closer examination of detectable species (i.e., common species) that likely have a stronger impact on community processes, than rare and/or transient species. Nonindigenous species that become widespread and abundant are likely governed by the same factors that regulate common native species. Ecology would benefit from linking studies of the factors that regulate the distribution and abundances of common species, both native and nonindigenous, and the dynamics between biodiversity and ecosystem properties and processes.

T1  - THE STATE OF LAKE MICHIGAN IN 2005
AN  - 2102828369
AB  - This second state-of-the-lake report for Lake Michigan identifies progress made during 2000-2004 in meeting the fish-community objectives established for the lake in 1995. An oral public report, providing more-extensive data than given here, was made in 2005. During 2000-2004, a geographical information system for the lake and its basin was expanded considerably and is expected to provide a means for establishing priorities for habitat remediation. This system was used in the development of a report, under review, identifying environmental objectives for the lake. Recently introduced invertebrates, particularly dreissenid mussels (Dreissena spp.), continued to impact the lake's food web. The number of naturally reproduced Chinook salmon smolts increased from about 2.5 million in the years just before 2000 to an average of more than 4.0 million during this reporting period. The yield of Chinook salmon was below the objective of 3.1 million kg during 2001-2003 but rose to 3.9 million kg in 2004. The harvest was not considered sustainable, even though stocking was cut in 1999, because growth, ration, and prey abundance were declining.

T1  - THE STATE OF LAKE HURON IN 2004
AN  - 2102827746
AB  - During this five-year reporting period (2000-2004), progress was made in Lake Huron towards achieving the objective of a fish community dominated by top predators, with self-sustaining populations of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) playing a prominent role. Some examples include increased representation of wild-born lake trout in surveys of adult lake trout, capture of wild young-of-the-year lake trout, and very large reductions in the abundance of the exotic alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), a species that likely impedes the rehabilitation of lake trout and other native species. Sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) abundance also decreased, which is a benefit for lake trout rehabilitation and for overall usable fish production. On the other hand, concerns have arisen that overall fishery productivity may have declined since 1999, the end of the previous reporting period. While the objective of a diverse salmon and trout fishery has been partially met, the contribution of the once-dominant Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) has declined dramatically. Overall yield objectives for both salmonid and non-salmonid species appear to be unrealistic. Predators are showing indications of substantial food limitation with overall prey-fish abundance substantially lower in 2004 than in 1999. Substantial uncertainty exists regarding the nature of the productivity changes and the role of dreissenid mussels and other exotic species in these changes. The yield of lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis), the dominant commercial species, declined from 1999 to 2004 to levels just below the yield target in the fish-community objective for all coregonines combined. Given the changes in lower trophic levels and the downward trend in lake whitefish yield, the target for coregonine yield, of which lake whitefish is the major component, is likely unsustainable. Lakewide walleye (Sander vitreus) yield remained near 35% of the yield target within the fish-community objective. Large year-classes of juvenile walleye were produced in Saginaw Bay in 2003 and 2004. How strongly these year-classes will contribute to fishery yield and whether juvenile abundance has surged elsewhere remains to be determined. Yellow perch (Perca flavescens) yield has declined to levels not seen since the 1920s for reasons that are not well understood. However, strong year-classes were observed in 2003 in the main basin. The lake sturgeon remains listed as a Threatened Species in Michigan, and as a Species of Concern in Ontario waters. Although its population increased, much progress is needed before the listings can be removed. Various escocids, centrarchids, and other nearshore species continue to contribute to diverse fishing opportunities. Species diversity remains essentially unchanged since 1999 with the notable reappearance of the shortjaw cisco (C. zenithicus), which was thought to be extirpated at the time of the 1999 report. An increasing number of studies of genetic stock structure have been conducted or are under way, but these projects are not sufficient to fully evaluate progress towards genetic-diversity objectives. In addition to exotic species that may be influencing the food web, invasive plant species are increasingly dominating wetlands and other nearshore areas and are potentially influencing the value of these areas as fish nursery habitat or as areas for recreation. More information is needed to assess progress towards habitat objectives. The foremost recommendation stemming from this report is to reevaluate the use of yield as the major metric for defining fish-community objectives. Increased research is also needed to better understand how lower trophic-level processes impact fish-community structure and production. Other recommendations include maintaining effective sea lamprey control, identifying high-priority habitat in need of protection, and directing more management towards native species restoration.

T1  - Spatial-Dynamic Modeling of Algal Biomass in Lake Erie: Relative Impacts of Dreissenid Mussels and Nutrient Loads
AN  - 20727793; 8233980
AB  - Over the past several decades, reductions in phytoplankton stocks and increased water clarity in Lake Erie have resulted from phosphorus load abatement and the introduction of zebra (Dreissena polymorpha) and quagga mussels (D. bugensis). The relative impacts of these developments and their implications for lake management have remained difficult to delineate. To address this issue, we numerically model the complex biophysical interactions occurring in Lake Erie using a two-dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model that is extended to include dreissenid mussel and zooplankton algorithms. The model reasonably simulates longitudinal trends in water quality as well as the dynamics of central basin hypoxia. Phosphorus is the limiting nutrient through the euphotic zone and its control decreases the algal growth rate and biomass (655-60%). Filter feeding by dreissenid mussels also decreases algal biomass (625-30%), simultaneously stimulating increased net algae growth through enhanced algal consumption and subsequent phosphorus recycling. Effective recycling implies that algae stocks are ultimately regulated by external phosphorus loads. Returning phosphorus loads to pre-abatement 1960s levels, in the presence of dreissenid mussels, results in a western basin algae concentration of 60.7 mg dry weight L super(-1) with a potential for nuisance algae growth.

T1  - Dietary Overlap of Sympatric Diving Ducks During Winter on Northeastern Lake Ontario
AN  - 196452983
AB  - Food resources available to diving ducks wintering on the Great Lakes have changed dramatically since the introduction of dreissenid mussels (Dreissena bugensis   and D. polymorpha  ). We investigated the diets of Buffleheads (Bucephala albeola  ), Common Goldeneyes (B. clangula  ), and Long-tailed Ducks (Clangula hyemalis  ) during winter, 2002-2004, on northeastern Lake Ontario and determined the levels of dietary overlap. Dietary niche-breadth values were low, and dietary overlap values (prey size and type) were high for all species. Ducks primarily consumed high-quality, energy-dense prey (Amphipoda, Chironomidae), which were abundant. Our results highlighted three patterns: (1) dreissenid mussels constituted 85% of the macroinvertebrate community in Lake Ontario but were consumed in relatively low amounts during winter, (2) foods of high energy-density such as Amphipoda and Chironomidae were likely abundant enough for ducks to selectively feed on them, and (3) some constraint caused ducks to select energy-dense prey instead of the most available items (dreissenid mussels). Although the abundance of prey may have allowed numbers of diving ducks to increase in the past few decades on the Great Lakes, the long-term implications of high levels of dietary overlap among diving ducks is relatively unknown and warrants continued monitoring.

T1  - Trends over Time for the Arkansas River Fishery: A Case History
AN  - 20342609; 9016255
AB  - We evaluated long-term fisheries data relative to a range of perturbations for the Arkansas River from 1970 to 2006. Rotenone sample sites were located at pool 13 (Garrison Creek), Ozark Lake (Lavaca), and Lake Dardanelle (Panther Cove and the Arkansas Nuclear 1 Effluent Bay). The period of record was 24 years for Garrison Creek and Lavaca, 29 years for Effluent Bay, and 30 years for Panther Cove. Mean total fish biomass ranged between 466 kg/ha and 1,601 kg/ha among sites, and no temporal trends were detected for total biomass. Invasion of zebra mussels Dreissenapolymorpha, discovery of largemouth bass virus, and imposition of a 381 mm total length (TL) minimum length limit for largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides likely contributed to notable changes in these fisheries during the past 30 years. Biomass of redear sunfish Lepomis microlophus, freshwater drum Aplodinotus grunniens, and blue catfish Ictalurus furcatus increased in association with the invasion of the river by nonnative zebra mussels. Spotted gar Lepisosteus oculatus and paddlefish Polyodon spathula biomass increased, and common carp Cyprinus carpio biomass declined coincident with the zebra mussel invasion. Large-scale sedimentation of aquatic habitats may have been related to observed declines of backwater-oriented species, especially common carp and spotted gar. The frequency of largemouth bass between 350 and 400 mm TL increased in electrofishing samples after the imposition of a 381-mm-TL minimum length limit, and total catch per hour of largemouth bass greater than 381 mm TL increased. Our associations would suggest that the discovery of largemouth bass virus during 2000 contributed to (1) lower electrofishing catch per hour of largemouth bass greater than 533 mm TL, and (2) an average increase of 420 h required for an angler to catch a 2.27-kg largemouth bass. We anticipate further changes in the Arkansas River during the next decade from the biological invasions of white perch Morone americana, bighead carp Hypophthalmichthys nobilis, and silver carp H. molitrix; increased establishment of aquatic vegetation; and accelerated loss of aquatic habitats associated with planned federal navigation channel improvements.

T1  - A management framework for preventing the secondary spread of aquatic invasive species
AN  - 20157395; 8850802
AB  - Biological invasions continue to accelerate, and there is a need for closer integration between invasive species research and on-the-ground management. In many regions, aquatic invasive species have established isolated populations, but have not yet spread to many sites that provide suitable habitat. In the Laurentian Great Lakes region, several Great Lakes invaders such as zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha), rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax), and spiny water flea (Bythotrephes longimanus) are currently undergoing secondary spread to the smaller inland lakes and streams. This paper describes recent advances in forecasting the secondary spread of aquatic invasive species and presents a framework for assessing vulnerability of inland waters based on explicit assessment of three distinct aspects of biological invasions: colonization, site suitability, and adverse impact. In many cases, only a fraction of lakes on the landscape are vulnerable to specific invasive species, highlighting the potential application of this type of research for improving invasive species management. Effective application to on-the-ground resource management will require that research aimed at assessing site vulnerability be translated into management tools.Original Abstract: Les invasions biologiques continuent a augmenter en nombre, c'est pourquoi il est necessaire de mieux integrer la recherche sur les especes envahissantes et leur gestion sur le terrain. Dans plusieurs regions, les especes aquatiques envahissantes ont etabli des populations isolees, mais ne se sont pas encore propagees dans plusieurs sites qui constituent des habitats appropries. C'est le cas de la region des Grands Lacs laurentiens ou des especes qui ont envahi les Grands Lacs, telles que les moules zebrees (Dreissena polymorpha), l'eperlan arc-en-ciel (Osmerus mordax) et la puce d'eau epineuse (Bythotrephes longimanus), sont actuellement en train d'etendre secondairement leur repartition aux petits lacs et cours d'eau de l'interieur des terres. Notre travail fait la synthese des developpements recents dans la prediction de la dispersion secondaire des especes aquatiques envahissantes et presente un cadre pour evaluer la vulnerabilite des eaux interieures d'apres une determination explicite de trois aspects differents des invasions biologiques, soit la colonisation, la convenance des sites et l'impact negatif. Souvent, seule une fraction des lacs dans un paysage sont vulnerables a une espece envahissante donnee, ce qui demontre l'interet potentiel de ce genre de recherche pour l'amelioration de la gestion des especes envahissantes. Une application efficace a la gestion des ressources sur le terrain requerra cependant que la recherche sur l'evaluation de la vulnerabilite des sites soit incorporee dans des outils de gestion.

T1  - Effects of the zebra mussel, an exotic freshwater species, on seston stoichiometry
AN  - 19488395; 8559034
AB  - We examined the effect of the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, an exotic species, on seston stoichiometry by conducting laboratory experiments in which we varied nutrient composition of seston and mussels over time. Zebra mussels altered the stoichiometry of seston through removal of particulate organic nutrients and changed the stoichiometry of the dissolved nutrient pool through nutrient excretion. Grazers had stronger effects on carbon : phosphorus (C : P) and nitrogen (N) : P ratios than on the C:N ratio of seston. Elemental residence time in tissue and high mass-specific nutrient excretion by small mussels caused small mussels to be more efficient nutrient recyclers than larger mussels. Zebra mussels reduced P availability through enhancing C: P and N: P molar ratios of seston during the period extending from June to August, when P was limited in the lake, and increased the C:N molar ratio of seston in June, when N was at the minimum level in the lake. C: P and N: P molar ratios for zebra mussel tissue were higher in August and somewhat in September than in all other months. N was retained more efficiently than P in Dreissena tissue. Nutrient mass-specific uptake rate was higher than excretion rate by zebra mussels.

T1  - Effects of Zebra Mussels (Dreissena Polymorpha) on Mobility of Three Native Mollusk Species
AN  - 19404916; 8698913
AB  - As invaders to North America, zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) have contributed to the decline of benthic species, the mechanisms of which are poorly understood. In this study, we examined effects of D. polymorpha biofouling on locomotion of one pleurocerid snail (Elimia livescens) and two unionid bivalves (Ligumia nasuta and Anodonta grandis) using observational studies and removal experiments. In field and laboratory experiments, E. livescens without zebra mussels traveled 1.5-1.6 times farther than snails with zebra mussels. In field experiments, unionids without zebra mussels traveled farther and were more likely to move than unionids colonized by zebra mussels. Decreases in travel distance in the snail, but not unionids, were significantly correlated with zebra mussel loading relative to host animal mass. Limited mobility caused by zebra mussels may have consequences for gastropods and unionids by disrupting reproductive habits, predator evasion and avoidance of unbearable environmental conditions. Localized extinctions may occur due to inability to disperse or energetic costs associated with carrying zebra mussels. Mobility constraints resulting from zebra mussel biofouling may be an important mechanism of population declines in native mollusk species.

T1  - Preferences of invasive Ponto-Caspian and native European gammarids for zebra mussel (<i>Dreissena polymorpha</i>, Bivalvia) shell habitat
AN  - 821229082
AB  - We investigated habitat preferences of two invasive Ponto-Caspian gammarids (Dikerogammarus haemobaphes and Pontogammarus robustoides) and a native European species (Gammarus fossarum) in laboratory experiments. The habitats consisted of the following objects: (1) living zebra mussels; (2) empty mussel shells (clean or coated with nail varnish) with both valves glued together using aquarium silicone sealant to imitate a living mussel; (3) stones (clean or varnished); (4) empty plates. Ten objects of the same type were glued to a plastic plate (10 × 10 cm) with methyl acrylic glue. The plates were placed in experimental tanks in various combinations. A single gammarid was put into the tank and its position was determined after 24 h. The studied species responded differently to the presence of zebra mussels. D. haemobaphes preferred living mussels rather than their empty shells and these two habitats over stones and empty plates. It responded positively to shell shape, selecting varnished shells rather than varnished stones, and to shell surface properties, selecting clean shells rather than varnished shells. It did not respond to waterborne mussel exudates. P. robustoides did not exhibit any preferences for the above-mentioned substrata. G. fossarum was attracted by empty mussel shells (but not by living mussels). It responded only to their shape, not to surface properties. The strong affinity for zebra mussels, exhibited by D. haemobaphes, might help it survive and develop stable populations in newly invaded areas.

T1  - Predicting habitat use and trophic interactions of Eurasian ruffe, round gobies, and zebra mussels in nearshore areas of the Great Lakes
AN  - 20465002; 7617772
AB  - The Laurentian Great Lakes have been subject to numerous introductions of nonindigenous species, including two recent benthic fish invaders, Eurasian ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernuus) and round gobies (Neogobius melanostomus), as well as the benthic bivalve, zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha). These three exotic species, or 'exotic triad,' may impact nearshore benthic communities due to their locally high abundances and expanding distributions. Laboratory experiments were conducted to determine (1) whether ruffe and gobies may compete for habitat and invertebrate food in benthic environments, and (2) if zebra mussels can alter those competitive relationships by serving as an alternate food source for gobies. In laboratory mesocosms, both gobies and ruffe preferred cobble and macrophyte areas to open sand either when alone or in sympatry. In a 9-week goby-ruffe competition experiment simulating an invasion scenario with a limited food base, gobies grew faster than did ruffe, suggesting that gobies may be competitively superior at low resource levels. When zebra mussels were added in a short-term experiment, the presence or absence of mussels did not affect goby or ruffe growth, as few zebra mussels were consumed. This finding, along with other laboratory evidence, suggests that gobies may prefer soft-bodied invertebrate prey over zebra mussels. Studies of interactions among the 'exotic triad', combined with continued surveillance, may help Great Lakes fisheries managers to predict future population sizes and distributions of these invasive fish, evaluate their impacts on native food webs, and direct possible control measures to appropriate species.

T1  - THE STATE OF LAKE SUPERIOR IN 2000
AN  - 2104072874
AB  - Fish-community objectives (FCOs) to guide lakewide, coordinated fishery management in Lake Superior were developed in 1990 in accordance with A Joint Strategic Plan for Management of Great Lakes Fisheries. These objectives were revised in 2000 to recognize the importance of habitat to achieving objectives, and because knowledge regarding fish community function and structure has changed in the last decade. The revised objectives emphasize natural reproduction of indigenous species, habitat protection, and prevention of additional introductions. Specific objectives have been developed for habitat, prey species, lake trout, lake whitefish, walleye, lake sturgeon, brook trout, non-native salmonines (Pacific salmon, rainbow trout, Atlantic salmon, brown trout, and splake), sea lamprey, nuisance species, and species diversity. Here, Ebener describes the status of the fish community inhabiting Lake Superior in 2000, changes since the last state-of-the- lake report in 1992, and progress toward achieving FCOs, which are provided at the start of the applicable chapters.

T1  - THE STATE OF LAKE ONTARIO IN 2003
AN  - 2102830567
AB  - Progress has been made toward achieving objectives for some elements of Lake Ontario's environment and fish communities, but major deficiencies remain. Specific objectives should be drafted covering productivity, lower trophic-level organisms, physical habitat, and invasive species, and more-recognizable (measurable) end points should be provided for existing objectives. Productivity has decreased in recent years due to actions by jurisdictions within the basin to reduce phosphorus loading and to the filter-feeding of expanding populations of dreissenid mussels (zebra and quagga). Dreissenid colonies encrust hard and soft natural habitat perhaps causing the decline in abundance of the amphipod Diporeia spp. Some embayments and coastal wetlands are degraded due to development, water-level control, and pollution by an expanding human population. Contaminant levels have declined in Lake Ontario fishes, but levels of PCBs, mirex, dioxin, and mercury are still high enough to trigger fish-consumption advisories. However, Lake Ontario remains an oligotrophic lake capable of providing an environment in which the fish-community objectives can be achieved.

T1  - The invasive bivalves Dreissena polymorpha and Limnoperna fortunei: parallels, contrasts, potential spread and invasion impacts
AN  - 19650271; 7400855
AB  - We contrast ecological and life history traits of the well studied freshwater invader, the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha), with the lesser known invasive golden mussel (Limnoperna fortunei) to compare salient biological traits and environmental limits, and to predict the potential spread and ecosystem impacts of L. fortunei in areas where it is introduced. Both species are sessile, byssate bivalves with a planktonic larval stage and extremely high reproductive capacity. For both species adults attain much higher biomass in waterbodies they invade than all of the native invertebrates combined, and they create substrate complexity otherwise not found in freshwater systems. Both are very active suspension feeders, greatly enhance benthic-pelagic coupling, and act as effective ecosystem engineers. Although taxonomically unrelated, their ecosystem impacts are surprisingly similar and follow from the novel ecological niche they share, rather than being species specific. The golden mussel has broader environmental tolerances and therefore may be a much more successful invader than D. polymorpha in regions dominated by acidic, soft and contaminated waters. In the near future L. fortunei may colonize the southern and central parts of North America, much farther north than has been previously predicted. Although to date the zebra mussel is considered the most aggressive freshwater invader, soon many waterbodies may receive another, even more aggressive invader.

T1  - Effects of increasing temperatures on population dynamics of the zebra mussel <i>Dreissena polymorpha</i>: implications from an individual-based model
AN  - 818897867
AB  - Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha, Pallas, 1771) have had unprecedented success in colonizing European and North American waters under strongly differing temperature regimes. Thus, the mussel is an excellent model of a species which is able to cope with increasing water temperatures expected under global change. We study three principle scenarios for successful survival of the mussel under rising temperatures: (1) no adaptation to future thermal conditions is needed, existing performance is great enough; (2) a shift (adaptation) towards higher temperatures is required; or (3) a broadening of the range of tolerated temperatures (adaptation) is needed. We developed a stochastic individual-based model which describes the demographic growth of D. polymorpha to determine which of the alternative scenarios might enable future survival. It is a day-degree model which is determined by ambient water temperature. Daily temperatures are generated based on long-term data of the River Rhine. Predictions under temperature conditions as recently observed for this river that are made for the phenology of reproduction, the age distribution and the shell length distribution conform with field observations. Our simulations show that temporal patterns in the life cycle of the mussel will be altered under rising temperatures. In all scenarios spawning started earlier in the year and the total reproductive output of a population was dominated by the events later in the spawning period. For maximum temperatures between 20 and 26°C no thermal adaptation of the mussel is required. No extinctions and stable age distributions over generations were observed in scenario 2 for all maximum temperatures studied. In contrast, no population with a fixed range of tolerated temperatures survived in scenario 3 with high maximum temperatures (28, 30, 32°C). Age distributions showed an excess of 0+ individuals which resulted in an extinction of the population for several thermal ranges investigated.

T1  - Fish Predation Of Zebra Mussels Attached To Quadrula Quadrula (Bivalvia: Unionidae) And Benthic Molluscs In A Great Lakes Coastal Wetland
AN  - 19656894; 7413236
AB  - Although the introduced zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, has eliminated most native unionid populations within the lower Great Lakes, some recent surveys have found diverse unionid communities in several Lake Erie coastal wetlands. In 2004, we tested whether fish predators reduced zebra mussels on Quadrula quadrula (Unionidae) in a Lake Erie coastal wetland. In June, we placed unionids and colonization plates in small-mesh exclosures (2.5-cm x 2.5-cm mesh), large-mesh exclosures (5-cm x 10-cm mesh), and open exclosures (2.5-cm x 2.5-cm mesh with two 40-cm x 40-cm openings). Zebra mussels and other benthic molluscs were sampled in October, and zebra mussel numbers on Q. quadrula outside exclosures were significantly higher in October than in June. Densities of zebra mussels on Q. quadrula and colonization plates were much higher in small-mesh and large-mesh treatments that excluded large fish than open treatments. Mean ( plus or minus 1 SE) densities of zebra mussels/unionid were also higher inside (1041 plus or minus 103) than outside (6.9 plus or minus 1.5) exclosures in October. These results indicate that large-bodied molluscivores (e.g., common carp, freshwater drum, channel catfish) can limit zebra mussel numbers in coastal wetlands. Densities of other molluscs (Sphaeriidae, Corbiculidae, Gastropoda, and Unionidae) were not different in sediments of exclosures and uncaged areas, suggesting that fish can have a greater impact on numbers of attached zebra mussels than benthic molluscs.

T1  - A Dreissena Risk Assessment for the Colorado River Ecosystem
AN  - 907191258; 16042119
AB  - Executive Summary Nonnative zebra and quagga mussels (Dreissena polymorpha and Dreissena bugensis, respectively; see photo above) were accidentally introduced to the Great Lakes in the 1980s and subsequently spread to watersheds of the Eastern United States (Strayer and others, 1999). The introduction of Dreissena mussels has been economically costly and has had large and far-reaching ecological impacts on these systems. Quagga mussels were found in Lakes Mead and Havasu in January 2007. Given the likelihood that quagga mussels and, eventually, zebra mussels will be introduced to Lake Powell and the Colorado River at Lees Ferry, it is important to assess the risks that introduction of Dreissena mussels pose to the Colorado River ecosystem (here defined as the segment of river from just below Glen Canyon Dam to Diamond Creek; hereafter CRE). In this report, I assess three different types of risks associated with Dreissena and the CRE: (1) the risk that Dreissena will establish at high densities in the CRE, (2) the risk of ecological impacts should Dreissena establish at high densities in the CRE or in Lake Powell, and (3) the risk that Dreissena will be introduced to tributaries of the CRE. The risk of Dreissena establishing within the CRE is low, except for the Lees Ferry tailwater reach where the risk appears high. Dreissena are unlikely to establish at high densities within the CRE or its tributaries because of high suspended sediment, high ratios of suspended inorganic:organic material, and high water velocities, all of which interfere with the ability of Dreissena to effectively filter feed. The rapids of Grand Canyon may represent a large source of mortality to larval Dreissena, which would limit their ability to disperse and colonize downstream reaches of the CRE. In contrast, conditions within the Lees Ferry tailwater generally appear suitable for Dreissena establishment, with the exception of high average water velocity. If Dreissena establish within the CRE, the risks of negative ecological impacts appear low. If Dreissena are able to attain moderate densities in Lees Ferry, estimates of filtration capacity indicate they are unlikely to substantially alter the composition (e.g., nutrient concentrations, suspended organic matter concentrations) of water exported from Lees Ferry. Further, a moderate density of Dreissena within Lees Ferry may actually increase food available to fishes by increasing habitat complexity and stimulating benthic production. If Dreissena attain moderate densities in the CRE mainstem, which seems unlikely, ecological impacts will probably be comparable to Lees Ferry-an increase in benthic production. Dreissena may have ecological impacts on the CRE, if they become established in Lake Powell and substantially alter the composition of water released from Glen Canyon Dam; however, it is unclear whether changes in the composition of water released from Glen Canyon Dam will have a net positive or negative impact on food availability in the CRE mainstem. The risk of Dreissena introduction to tributaries appears low. None of the tributaries have upstream lakes or reservoirs that could actually serve as a source population for Dreissena; reservoirs on the Little Colorado River may eventually support Dreissena, but they are far up in the watershed and the segment of river connecting them with the mainstem CRE is intermittent. If the CRE mainstem is colonized by Dreissena, there are no significant vectors for transporting them upstream into the tributaries. In addition, lethally high summer water temperatures make it unlikely that Dreissena will establish in many tributaries. Lake Powell is a logical focus for management and research efforts, given that maintenance of Dreissena populations within the CRE will require an upriver source population and the uncertainty associated with the downstream impact of changes in Lake Powell water quality.

T1  - Evidence for Remote Effects of Dreissenid Mussels on the Amphipod Diporeia: Analysis of Lake Ontario Benthic Surveys, 1972-2003
AN  - 20922258; 7652743
AB  - The status of invasive dreissenid mussels (Dreissena polymorpha and D. bugensis) and native amphipods (Diporeia spp.) in Lake Ontario was assessed in 2003 and compared with historical data. D. polymorpha (zebra mussels) were rarely observed in 2003, having been displaced by D. bugensis (quagga mussels). D. bugensis expanded its depth range from 38 m depth in 1995 to 174 m in 2003 and this dreissenid reached densities averaging 8,000/m super(2) at all sites < 90 m. During the same time period, Diporeia populations almost completely disappeared from 0-90 m depth, continuing a declining trend from 1994-1997 reported in previous studies. The average density of Diporeia in the 30-90 m depth interval decreased from 1,380/m super(2) to 63/m super(2) between 1997 and 2003. Prior to 2003, areas deeper than 90 m represented a refuge for Diporeia, but even these deep populations decreased, with densities declining from 2,181/m super(2) in 1999 to 545/m super(2) in 2003. Two common hypotheses for the decline of Diporeia in the Great Lakes are food limitation and a toxin/pathogen associated with dreissenid pseudofeces. The Diporeia decline in deep waters preceded the expansion of D. bugensis to these depths, and suggests that shallow dreissenid populations remotely influence profundal habitats. This pattern of decline is consistent with mechanisms that act from some distance including nearshore dreissenid grazing and downslope transport of pseudofeces.

T1  - The Influence of Anthropogenic Disturbance and Environmental Suitability on the Distribution of the Nonindigenous Amphipod, Echinogammarus ischnus, at Laurentian Great Lakes Coastal Margins
AN  - 19551315; 8703144
AB  - Invasion ecology offers a unique opportunity to examine drivers of ecological processes that regulate communities. Biotic resistance to nonindigenous species establishment is thought to be greater in communities that have not been disturbed by human activities. Alternatively, invasion may occur wherever environmental conditions are appropriate for the colonist, regardless of the composition of the existing community and the level of disturbance. We tested these hypotheses by investigating distribution of the nonindigenous amphipod, Echinogammarus ischnus Stebbing, 1899, in co-occurrence with a widespread amphipod, Gammarus fasciatus Say, 1818, at 97 sites across the Laurentian Great Lakes coastal margins influenced by varying types and levels of anthropogenic stress. E. Ischnus was distributed independently of disturbance gradients related to six anthropogenic disturbance variables that summarized overall nutrient input, nitrogen, and phosphorus load carried from the adjacent coastal watershed, agricultural land area, human population density, overall pollution loading, and the site-specific dominant stressor, consistent with the expectations of regulation by general environmental characteristics. Our results support the view that the biotic facilitation by dreissenid mussels and distribution of suitable habitats better explain E. ischnus' distribution at Laurentian Great Lakes coastal margins than anthropogenic disturbance.

T1  - The Influence of Anthropogenic Disturbance and Environmental Suitability on the Distribution of the Nonindigenous Amphipod, Echinogammarus ischnus, at Laurentian Great Lakes Coastal Margins
AN  - 19301128; 8233015
AB  - Invasion ecology offers a unique opportunity to examine drivers of ecological processes that regulate communities. Biotic resistance to nonindigenous species establishment is thought to be greater in communities that have not been disturbed by human activities. Alternatively, invasion may occur wherever environmental conditions are appropriate for the colonist, regardless of the composition of the existing community and the level of disturbance. We tested these hypotheses by investigating distribution of the nonindigenous amphipod, Echinogammarus ischnus Stebbing, 1899, in co- occurrence with a widespread amphipod, Gammarus fasciatus Say, 1818, at 97 sites across the Laurentian Great Lakes coastal margins influenced by varying types and levels of anthropogenic stress. E. Ischnus was distributed independently of disturbance gradients related to six anthropogenic disturbance variables that summarized overall nutrient input, nitrogen, and phosphorus load carried from the adjacent coastal watershed, agricultural land area, human population density, overall pollution loading, and the site-specific dominant stressor, consistent with the expectations of regulation by general environmental characteristics. Our results support the view that the biotic facilitation by dreissenid mussels and distribution of suitable habitats better explain E. Ischnus' distribution at Laurentian Great Lakes coastal margins than anthropogenic disturbance.

T1  - ENDOSYMBIONTS OF DREISSENA POLYMORPHA IN IRELAND: EVIDENCE FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF ADULT MUSSELS
AN  - 195517791
AB  - Although zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) have invaded waters across Europe for over 200 years, they colonized Ireland only within the past decade. To test the hypothesis that Ireland was colonized by adult D. polymorpha, we examined mussels from different sites along the Lower Shannon River system in Ireland for the presence of host specific and generalist endosymbionts.Within the mantle cavity and/or associated with zebra mussel tissues we found species specific-ciliates (Conchophthirus acuminatus and Ophryoglena hemophaga) and generalist symbionts (the ciliate Ancistrumina limnica, nematodes, oligochaetes and chironomids). We found a significant difference in the prevalence of symbionts among sites, but all mussels at all sites harboured one specialist species C. acuminatus, and all of the mussels at three of the four sites also had the second specialist, O. hemophaga. Thus, with the introduction of D. polymorpha into Ireland, at least two additional species, their host-specific symbionts C. acuminatus and O. hemophaga, have also been introduced. The presence of these symbionts in Ireland supports the hypothesis that adult zebra mussels were introduced into Ireland, rather than larval stages. This contrasts with the introduction of zebra mussels to North America, where adult zebra mussels are devoid of host-specific symbionts.

T1  - POPULATION DYNAMICS OF ZEBRA MUSSELS DREISSENA POLYMORPHA (PALLAS, 1771) DURING THE INITIAL INVASION OF THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI RIVER, USA
AN  - 195511710
AB  - The aim of this study was to document and model the population dynamics of zebra mussels Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas, 1771) in Pool 8 of the Upper Mississippi River (UMR), USA, for five consecutive years (1992-1996) following their initial discovery in September 1991. Artificial substrates (concrete blocks, 0.49 m
2 surface area) were deployed on or around the first of May at two sites within each of two habitat types (main channel border and contiguous backwater). Blocks were removed monthly (30 ± 10 d) from the end of May to the end of October to obtain density and growth information. Some blocks deployed in May 1995 were retrieved in April 1996 to obtain information about over-winter growth and survival. The annual density of zebra mussels in Pool 8 of the UMR increased from 3.5/m
2 in 1992 to 14,956/m2 in 1996. The average May-October growth rate of newly recruited individuals, based on a von Bertalanffy growth model fitted to monthly shell-length composition data, was 0.11 mm/d. Model estimates of the average survival rate varied from 21 to 100% per month. Estimated recruitment varied substantially among months, with highest levels occurring in September-October of 1994 and 1996, and in July of 1995. Recruitment and density in both habitat types increased by two orders of magnitude in 1996. Follow-up studies will be necessary to assess the long-term stability of zebra mussel populations in the UMR; this study provides the critical baseline information needed for those future comparisons.

T1  - Zooplankton Prey Availability and Inferred Diet of Age-0 Lake Whitefish, Spanning the Introductions of Benthic Filter Feeders and a Predatory Zooplankter to Lake Ontario
AN  - 20726127; 7182527
AB  - In the eastern basin of Lake Ontario, lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) have exhibited dramatic declines in growth and abundance since 1995. Declines among age-0 whitefish may be attributed to reduced parental investment in reproduction, altered lake thermal regime, or reduced availability of zooplankton prey during a period of extensive ecological change. Among these changes were the introductions of 2 benthic filter feeders (Dreissena polymorpha & Dreissena bugensis) in 1991 and 1993, and a predatory cladoceran (Cercopagis pengoi) in 1998. Dreissena sp. are believed to have reduced zooplankton densities in the Great Lakes by limiting the availability of algal production. In Lake Ontario, C. pengoi are thought to have reduced the abundance and production of small zooplankton in 1999 and 2000, and have been observed in the stomachs of age-0 and planktivorous fishes. Using a size-based approach to analyze the zooplankton community, we present age-0 whitefish stomach content data and prey electivity indices measured in 2003 and 2004, and time series of age-0 whitefish catch-per-unit-effort and zooplankton density collected between 1979 and 2004. We evaluate whether Dreissena sp. and C. pengoi may have restricted the availability of zooplankton prey to age-0 whitefish, and discuss potential impacts to year-class strength.

T1  - Long-term demography of a zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) population
AN  - 20856502; 6571061
AB  - 1. We used long-term data and a simulation model to investigate temporal fluctuations in zebra mussel populations, which govern the ecological and economic impacts of this pest species. 2. The size of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) population in the Hudson River estuary fluctuated approximately 11-fold across a 13-year period, following a cycle with a 2-4 year period. 3. This cycling was caused by low recruitment during years of high adult population size, rapid somatic growth of settled animals, and adult survivorship of 50% per year. 4. Adult growth and body condition were weakly correlated with phytoplankton biomass. 5. The habitat distribution of the Hudson's population changed over the 13-year period, with an increasing proportion of the population spreading onto soft sediments over time. The character of soft-sediment habitats in the Hudson changed because of large amounts (mean = 34 g DM m super(-2)) of empty zebra mussel shells now in the sediments. 6. Simulation models show that zebra mussel populations can show a range of long-term trajectories, depending on the balance between adult space limitation, larval food limitation, and disturbance. 7. Effective understanding and management of the effects of zebra mussels and other alien species depend on understanding of their long-term demography, which may vary across ecosystems.

T1  - The larvae of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) in the estuarine transition zone of the St. Lawrence: spatial and temporal distribution, impacts and carbon sources.
AN  - 20314431; 8945440
AB  - The St. Lawrence estuarine transition zone (ETZ) is a productive ecosystem supporting a larval fish nursery. Since 1994, zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) have invaded this region and their larval veligers have become the dominant zooplankton during the summer (up to 260 individuals L super( -1)). Their seasonal dominance of the zooplankton community caused much concern about their potential impacts on the ETZ food web. Much information is available on the impacts of adults on aquatic food webs; however there is a paucity of information on their larval veliger stage, particularly concerning their distribution, the carbon sources they use, their impacts on food webs and their capacity to use dissolved organic carbon (DOC) as adults have been shown to do. Consequently, the overarching objectives of this research were to determine: (1) their impacts on the structure of the pelagic microbial community through their dominance and grazing pressure; (2) the role the ETZ plays in the context of a large river system; (3) the environmental factors controlling the distribution of veligers across the ETZ (freshwater to saltwater); (4) the carbon sources assimilated by the veligers in situ; (5) the trophic role they play in the ETZ food web; and (6) the veligers' capacity to directly assimilate DOC and use this carbon source in the ETZ. The microbial variations observed in the microbial community structure cannot be ascribed to the veliger invasion. The ETZ appears productive enough to support these dominant invaders and despite minor changes in the biovolume size spectrum, the microbial community remains dominated by autotrophs, in the picoplankton and nanoplankton size classes, and the cell concentrations of microbial components have remained similar to pre-invasion values. Grazing by the abundant ETZ zooplankton, salinity, and hydrodynamic retention are the environmental factors controlling the structure and composition of the microbial community from freshwater to saltwater across the transition zones. According to the traditional view of rivers as longitudinal continua, the ETZ inserts itself as a discontinuous segment within the St. Lawrence River corridor. The sharp gradients in the environmental variables incur abrupt changes in the structure of the planktonic community. The veligers' longitudinal distribution was limited by salinity, with maximum decreases in concentration at 2[per. A sharp decline in prey availability at >2[per may be a secondary stressor for the veligers, in addition to the direct effects of salinity. Their vertical distribution was homogeneous throughout the water column, even in the presence of a pycnocline. Redundancy analysis revealed that veliger concentrations were positively correlated with temperature and turbidity and negatively correlated with salinity and total phosphorus. Veligers were also positively correlated with chlorophyll a and picophytoplankton concentrations, suggesting little effect on their phytoplankton prey. Moreover, the veligers were positively correlated with the sestonic ratio of particulate to total phosphorus, indicating their positive association with good food quality. The veligers appear to have no severe negative impacts on the ETZ plankton community and are restricted to favourable conditions (high seston quality) for their survival in the upstream, low salinity region of the ETZ. We evaluated by stable isotope analysis the trophic structure of the ETZ food web and the trophic role played by the veligers. d super(13 )C ranged from -31.2[per (seston) to -16.1[per (adult fish) and d super(15)N ranged from 2.6[per to 17.9[per. Isotopic analysis of samples indicated that the overall food web was largely supported by autochthonous phytoplankton rather than by allochthonous terrestrial carbon. Large differences among the isotopic signals of veligers, cladocerans and copepods suggested the use of different proportions of food items, and the isotopic values of fish larvae indicated no significant assimilation of veligers. The d super(13)C signature of the veligers was in a range consistent with feeding on free-living bacteria and DOC or both, and freshwater algae incubated in situ. To investigate the possibility of DOC uptake by the veligers, veligers were incubated with super(14)C-labelled algal lysates. There was rapid uptake of DOC and incorporation into biomass, equivalent to 6% of the soft tissue dry weight per hour. Zebra mussel veligers are likely using autochthonous DOC as an alternate food source, and they occupy an exotic trophic position in which there is little direct interaction with other major components of the ETZ food web.

T1  - Ecology of the Hudson River Zooplankton Community
AN  - 19846503; 7087870
AB  - Zooplankton in the Hudson River estuary include both freshwater and estuarine species and range in body lengths from microns to millimeters. Measurements of abundance and biomass as well as community rate processes indicate that zooplankton do not generally exert significant grazing pressure on phytoplankton. In addition, recycling of nutrients by zooplankton is not significant to primary producers because concentrations of dissolved nutrients are quite high in the Hudson and controlled by other processes. Zooplankton do provide an important linkage in the food web as they are key prey items for many young-of-year fish as well as fish that are primarily planktivorous throughout life. Long-term observations indicate many zooplankton populations undergo regular seasonal cycles in abundance, typically with increases during warm, low-flow periods of the year. The invasion of the zebra mussel into the Hudson had strong impacts on zooplankton in the freshwater section of the estuary. Microzooplankton such as rotifers declined dramatically. Cladocerans also declined in annual average abundance between pre- and post-zebra mussel periods when the effects of wet and dry years are taken into account. Zebra mussels, however, had little effect on larger zooplankton. Regulation of zooplankton appears to be a function of physical forces that affect population residence times as well as food and predators. Evidence for food limitation is mixed. Some species benefit from food supplements in experimental trials, but the reduction of phytoplankton biomass in association with the zebra mussel invasion had no effect on clado-ceran egg production. There are a variety of potential predators, and calculations indicate fish exert high rates of mortality on zooplankton. Direct measures of predatory mortality and a better understanding of benthic-pelagic interactions are important topics for future research. In addition, we raise the general question of how strongly zooplankton interactions with predators and prey are coupled in the food web. If interactions are weak, changes such as species invasions or large interannual variation in fish populations may not impact the zooplankton, and thereby, propagation of effects up and down the food web could be highly attenuated.

T1  - Long-term demography of a zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) population
AN  - 19449701; 7019128
AB  - Long-term data and a simulation model were used to investigate temporal fluctuations in zebra mussel populations, which govern the ecological and economic impacts of this pest species. The size of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) population in the Hudson River estuary fluctuated approximately 11-fold across a 13-year period, following a cycle with a 2-4 year period. This cycling was caused by low recruitment during years of high adult population size, rapid somatic growth of settled animals, and adult survivorship of 50% per year. Adult growth and body condition were weakly correlated with phytoplankton biomass. The habitat distribution of the Hudson's population changed over the 13-year period, with an increasing proportion of the population spreading onto soft sediments over time. The character of soft-sediment habitats in the Hudson changed because of large amounts (mean = 34 g DM m super(-2)) of empty zebra mussel shells now in the sediments. Simulation models show that zebra mussel populations can show a range of long-term trajectories, depending on the balance between adult space limitation, larval food limitation, and disturbance. Effective understanding and management of the effects of zebra mussels and other alien species depend on understanding of their long-term demography, which may vary across ecosystems.

T1  - Invasion ecology of quagga mussels (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis): a review of evolutionary and phylogenetic impacts
AN  - 751487344
AB  - Two invasive freshwater mussels, Dreissena  rostriformis  bugensis (quagga mussel) and D. polymorpha (zebra mussel), reveal differences in patterns and timing of their invasions in Europe. They belong to different clades in Dreissena phylogenetics: D. rostriformis  bugensis genetically is coupled with the brackish water, lacustrine D. r. distincta and the two are believed to represent a single species. As such, the guaqqa mussel has environmental requirements that differ from the congeneric D. polymorpha. D. rostriformis  bugensis invasions were confined to reservoirs of the Dnieper, Don and Dniester Rivers of the Black Sea basin. We recorded D. r. bugensis outside the Black Sea basin for the first time between 1992 and 2001, along the Volga River reservoir cascade including the Northern Caspian Sea shallows. This represents a 40-year invasion time lag since an invasion corridor through the Volgo-Don Waterway was established in 1952 (a corridor used extensively by many invertebrate species from the Black Sea region). We attribute the postponed invasion of Europe by D. r. bugensis, including peculiarities in establishment and its absence in fossil records, to its phylogenetically close relationship with D. r. distincta and its recent evolutionary origin. The relatively rapid range expansion of D. r. bugensis in eastern Europe during the past several decades was facilitated by human-mediated ecosystem transformation, notably impoundment of large eastern European rivers, that have allowed this species to utilize newly transformed ecosystems.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

Some invaders have become fishery or aquaculture pests while others have themselves become fisheries. Still other invaders, such as the green mussel, Perna viridis, have fishery potential but may also damage existing fisheries or aquaculture. In its presumed native range, from the Persian Gulf to the Philippines, P. viridis is known both as a fishery and as a costly fouling organism. It has been introduced throughout the Indo-Pacific, appeared in the Caribbean in 1989 and, by 1999, had invaded Florida, USA. P. viridis initially spread south from its point of origin in Tampa Bay, Florida, with prevailing coastal currents. In 2002 it invaded northeast Florida and has spread north to at least Georgia, but has not yet invaded southeast Florida. Prior invasion patterns and laboratory tolerance trials suggest cold temperatures will limit northward range expansion to the Gulf of Mexico and the southeastern United States. P. viridis attains fishery size within a year and forms dense monocultures. It is a recreational fishery in the Tampa area of Florida but health concerns related to harmful algal blooms are still unresolved. In addition, P. viridis out-competes the native and ecologically important eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica. C. virginica has been almost entirely displaced on offshore structures and most oyster reefs in Tampa Bay have been overgrown by P. viridis, eradicating adult oysters. Impacts on other benthic communities appear to be highly spatially variable.

T1  - The effects of predation and unionid burrowing on bivalve communities in a Laurentian Great Lake coastal wetland
AN  - 17149095; 6789299
AB  - Unionid (Mollusca: Unionidae) densities have declined dramatically throughout the Laurentian Great Lakes after the introduction of dreissenid mussels (Mollusca: Dreissenidae). Recent surveys in some Great Lake coastal wetlands have found abundant unionid populations, but the factors that reduce zebra mussels on unionids in these habitats are not well understood. In 2001-2002, we tested effects of predation and unionid burrowing on corbiculids, sphaeriids and dreissenids in a Great Lake coastal wetland in western Lake Erie. In one experiment, we reduced access by molluscivores using exclosures with two mesh sizes (1.3 cm x 1.3 cm; 5 cm x 10 cm) and sampled bivalves after 15 months. Small mesh exclosures had higher numbers of dreissenids, Corbicula fluminea and sphaeriids (54.9, 3.8, 22.6 individuals/m super(2), respectively) than large mesh exclosures (0.0, 1.13, 0.13 individuals/m super(2), respectively) or open controls (0.3, 1.0, 0.1 individuals/m super(2), respectively). Numbers of dreissenids on C. fluminea were higher in small mesh exclosures (3.8 dreissenids/Corbicula) than in large mesh exclosures (0.1 dreissenids/Corbicula) or cageless controls (0 dreissenids/Corbicula). In a second experiment, we held two species of live unionids (Leptodea fragilis, Quadrula quadrula) and immobile Pyganodon grandis shells in exclosures (2.5 cm x 2.5 cm mesh) with either 5 cm, 10 cm, or 20 cm deep sediments and sampled bivalves after 2 months. There were fewer dreissenids on L. fragilis than P. grandis shells, but there was no difference in the number of dreissenids on Q. quadrula and P. grandis shells. Numbers of attached dreissenids were higher inside (189-494 dreissenids/unionid) than outside (8-11 dreissenids/unionid) exclosures, and densities of sphaeriid and C. fluminea clams were also higher inside (21.8, 4.7 individuals/m super(2), respectively) than outside (0.4, 0.9 individuals/m super(2), respectively) exclosures. Numbers of attached dreissenids were higher on unionids that could burrow below the sediments (20 cm depth) than unionids in shallow sediments (5 cm depth) for unexplained reasons. Our data suggest that molluscivores can play a pivotal role in limiting numbers of bivalves including dreissenids in coastal wetlands.

T1  - Grazing on colonial and filamentous, toxic and non-toxic cyanobacteria by the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha
AN  - 220251578
AB  - Colony forming and toxic cyanobacteria form a problem in surface waters of shallow lakes, both for recreation and wildlife. Zebra mussels, Dreissena polymorpha, have been employed to help to restore shallow lakes in the Netherlands, dominated by cyanobacteria, to their former clear state. Zebra mussels have been present in these lakes since they were created in the 19th century by the excavation of peat and are usually not considered to be an invasive species. Most grazing experiments using Dreissena have been performed with uni-cellular phytoplankton laboratory strains and information on grazing of larger phytoplankton taxa hardly exists. To gain more insight in to whether D. polymorpha is indeed able to decrease cyanobacteria in the phytoplankton, we therefore performed grazing experiments with zebra mussels and two species of cyanobacteria, that greatly differ in shape: colony forming strains of Microcystis aeruginosa and the filamentous species Planktothrix agardhii. For both species a toxic and a non-toxic strain was selected. We found that zebra mussels cleared toxic Planktothrix at a higher rate than non-toxic Planktothrix, toxic or non-toxic Microcystis. Clearance rates between the other strains were not significantly different. Both phytoplankton species, regardless of toxicity, size and shape, were found in equal amounts (based on chlorophyll concentrations) in the excreted products of the mussels (pseudofaeces). The results show that zebra mussels are capable of removing colonial and filamentous cyanobacteria from the water, regardless of whether the cyanobacteria are toxic or not. This implies that the mussels may be used as a biofilter for the removal of harmful cyanobacterial blooms in shallow (Dutch) lakes where the mussels are already present and not a nuisance. Providing more suitable substrate for zebra mussel attachment may lead to appropriate mussel densities capable of filtering large quantities of cyanobacteria.

T1  - PROCEEDINGS OF A WORKSHOP ON THE DYNAMICS OF LAKE WHITEFISH (COREGONUS CLUPEAFORMIS) AND THE AMPHIPOD DIPOREIA SPP. IN THE GREAT LAKES
AN  - 2102393761
AB  - Abstract Because of growing concern in the Great Lakes over declines in abundance and growth of lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) and declines in abundance of the benthic amphipod Diporeia spp., a workshop was held to examine past and current trends, to explore trophic links, and to discuss the latest research results and needs.

The loss of Diporeia spp., a major food item of whitefish, has been a factor in observed declines, particularly in Lake Ontario, but density-dependent factors also likely played a role in Lakes Michigan and Huron.

Among the more significant factors attributed to causing declines were overexploitation, predation by and competition with invasive species (i.e., sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax), and alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus)), and degradation of water quality and habitat.

With the loss of diporeia, whitefish have been forced to alter forage patterns and feed on benthic organisms that are of lower nutritional value, are less abundant, or are not as readily available (Pothoven et al. 2001).

Besides the loss of diporeia, other direct or confounding factors that may also be contributing to the decline in whitefish growth and condition include density-dependent mechanisms, parasitism, climate/temperature changes, and/or food-web shifts other than those related to diporeia.

T1  - Potential Economic Impacts of Zebra Mussels on the Hydropower Facilities in the Columbia River Basin
AN  - 19662728; 9010229
AB  - The purpose of this study was to estimate costs to the Federal Columbia River Power System hydroelectric projects in the event of a zebra mussel infestation. We estimated hydropower maintenance costs associated with zebra mussels by examining the Bonneville Dam First Powerhouse, costs associated with Asian clam (Corbiculafluminea) control at Bonneville, and a survey of zebra mussel mitigation costs at other hydropower generation facilities in North America. We found that the one-time cost for installing zebra mussel control systems at hydroelectric projects could range from the hundreds of thousands of dollars to over a million dollars per facility. The estimated cost for a hypothetical zebra mussel mitigation strategy, based upon two response scenarios (a sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) injection system and anti-fouling paint), at 13 select hydroelectric projects, was $23,621,000. The cost per generator was $62,599 for the NaOCl system, and $81,000 for antifouling paint (not including labor). Removal, painting, sandblasting and installation could potentially double antifouling paint treatment costs. We estimated that if a NaOCl system was installed at an "average" size Columbia River Basin facility, assuming intermittent use, annual operating costs would likely not exceed $100,000. Operating costs will vary depending on the facility, degree of infestation, environmental permits, etc. This investigation found that once utilities initiate long-term mussel control programs, they usually become part of routine maintenance at annual, biennial, or longer intervals, depending on how rapidly the mussels recolonize the systems. A detailed management plan is needed to determine the best zebra mussel mitigation and control strategy for the FCRPS. The management plan should detail key agency contacts and coordination; control technologies; permit requirements; costs for the hydroelectric and nuclear facilities, transportation, upstream and downstream fish passage system; and the environmental impacts of likely mitigation technologies. Engineers, biologists and other relevant experts with hands-on experience in developing zebra mussel mitigation strategies should be sought out and utilized.

Removal, painting, sandblasting and installation could potentially double antifouling paint treatment costs. We estimated that if a NaOCI system was installed at an "average" size Columbia River Basin facility, assuming intermittent use, annual operating costs would likely not exceed $100,000. Operating costs will vary depending on the facility, degree of infestation, environmental permits, etc. This investigation found that once utilities initiate long-term mussel control programs, they usually become part of routine maintenance at annual, biennial, or longer intervals, depending on how rapidly the mussels recolonize the systems. A detailed management plan is needed to determine the best zebra mussel mitigation and control strategy for the FCRPS. The management plan should detail key agency contacts and coordination; control technologies; permit requirements; costs for the hydroelectric and nuclear facilities, transportation, upstream and downstream fish passage system; and the environmental impacts of likely mitigation technologies. Engineers, biologists and other relevant experts with hands-on experience in developing zebra mussel mitigation strategies should be sought out and utilized.

T1  - Characterization of Coastal Great Lakes Benthic Habitat
AN  - 20716656; 6491650
AB  - Colonization by dreissenid mussels, Dreissena polymorpha (Zebra) and Dreissena bugensis (Quagga), is one of the more ecologically important events to occur in the Great Lakes during the last decade. Since their introduction into the Great Lakes, dreissenids have colonized both soft and hard substrates to depths of 80 m and reached average densities of 40,000 mussels m super(-2) in the littoral zone. Because of high densities and widespread distribution, they have modified habitats for benthos and fishes and fostered growth and proliferation of non-indigenous species, such as the round goby and a Black Sea amphipod, Echinogammarus. In 2001, we used multibeam sonar to characterize the benthic habitat in Lake Michigan and acoustic remote sensing technology (sidescan sonar and acoustic bottom classification) to extend and extrapolate information on dreissenid distributions from spatially limited observations. These observations were combined with discrete in situ (video and SCUBA) observations in a geographic information system (GIS). We used this system to link dreissenid distribution with substrate type, morphology and depth. These data are critical inputs to modeling the ecological implications of dreissenid filtering on algal biomass and composition in the Great Lakes over changing environmental conditions.

T1  - Influence of physicochemical factors on the distribution and biomass of invasive mussels (Dreissena polymorpha and Dreissena bugensis) in the St. Lawrence River.
AN  - 19576187; 6600897
AB  - Twenty sites along the St. Lawrence River were sampled to determine if the distribution and abundance of invasive mussels (zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) and quagga mussel (Dreissena bugensis)) are explained by physicochemical variables. Calcium concentration, substrate size, and depth independently explaained significant proportions of variation in biomass for both species. Zebra mussel populations occurred at calcium levels as low as 8 mg Ca times L super(-1), but quagga mussels were absent below 12 mg Ca times L super(-1), suggesting that they have higher calcium requirements. Both species increased in biomass with increasing substrate size but displayed contrasting patterns with depth. Using combinations of these environmental variables, stepwise multiple regression models were developed to predict zebra mussel biomass and quagga mussel biomass. The zebra mussel model included calcium concentration, substrate size, and depth (r super(2) = 0.36, P < 0.0001), while the quagga mussel model included only substrate size and depth (r super(2) = 0.32, P < 0.0001). These results suggest that dreissenid mussel abundance (and correlated impacts) will vary predictably across environmental gradients, but the same predictive model will not be accurate for both species.

T1  - Reemergence of Submerged Aquatic Vegetation in Oneida Lake, NY
AN  - 19940562; 6009290
AB  - The combined effects of phosphorus abatement resulting from the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement (GLWQA) and invasion by zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) has released nearshore habitats of Oneida Lake, NY from light limitation. Increased water clarity has resulted in the reemergence of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), increased benthic production rates, and had the expected effect of improving habitats for native species along with the unexpected effect of making habitats more vulnerable to invasion by non-native species. In this study, we quantify changes in the distribution of SAV in Oneida Lake in response to increased water clarity with field and hydroacoustic surveys, and aerial photo interpretation (API). Results showed high water clarity and an extensive distribution of SAV in 1916, followed by low water clarity and a limited distribution of SAV during the period of eutrophication. After the GLWQA, a trend of increasing water clarity and reemergence of SAV occurred, and high water clarity and an extensive distribution of SAV followed the arrival of dreissenid mussels. The combined consequences of the GLWQA and dreissenid mussel invasion increased water clarity, SAV, and the importance of benthic production, a process we term benthification.

T1  - Seasonal and temporal variability in tissue biochemistry of several freshwater mussel species
AN  - 18046494; 5962420
AB  - Freshwater mussel populations are highly imperiled worldwide. In the United States, approximately 70% of native species are in serious decline because of chronic environmental degradation, toxic spills, and the invasion of the exotic zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha). All 70 endangered mussel species recovery plans call for propagation and reintroduction of populations to achieve recovery. Additionally, propagation technology is viewed as a recovery mitigation tool for mussels killed by toxic spills or other anthropogenic impacts. To support successful propagation, baseline information on the nutritional demands of wild freshwater mussels is needed in order to develop suitable diets and feeding regimes for maintaining mussels in captivity. Our goal is to quantify variability in physiologic status of several species of mussels from varying drainages and from different subfamilies. Proximate tissue biochemistry (protein, lipid, carbohydrate, and ash) was monitored in healthy populations of mussels collected from rivers in the Atlantic and Ohio River drainages over a 3-year period. Biochemistry varied seasonally and temporally across the years of study. Biochemistry also differed between the subfamilies of mussels. The mean carbohydrate level (%DTW) of each species was similar; whereas, the relative protein and lipid levels differed between species. These results reflect the reproductive and seasonal conditioning behavior of these animals, and their responsiveness to environmental changes. Until further information becomes available on absolute nutritional requirements, we recommend the following dietary composition for captive freshwater mussel diets: similar to 5%-10% carbohydrate, similar to 20%-40% protein, similar to 30% lipid, and ash similar to 20%.

T1  - Effects of Hydrology on Unionids (Unionidae) and Zebra Mussels (Dreissenidae) in a Lake Erie Coastal Wetland
AN  - 17779827; 5902417
AB  - Infestation by introduced zebra mussels has extirpated native unionids in many Great Lake habitats. Shallow areas in coastal wetlands are intermittently dewatered by seiches and seasonal water level changes, and we examined how water level fluctuations and sediment characteristics affected interactions among unionids and zebra mussels in a Lake Erie coastal marsh. In 2001 we sampled unionid distributions and measured zebra mussel colonization on PVC plates at 1 cm, 18 cm and >35 cm water depths. We found a diverse unionid community (15 species) with many juvenile unionids. Unionid densities (0.01 unionids/m2) were comparable to other coastal wetlands, but are lower than reported in offshore areas before zebra mussels were introduced. Zebra mussels colonized plates at >3000 individuals/m2 in some locations. Although >60% of unionids had byssal threads on their shells, >75% of unionids had no attached zebra mussels. Therefore, zebra mussels are colonizing unionids, but are not surviving. Unionid numbers and zebra mussel colonization were low in shallow (1-35 cm) water depths, indicating that water level fluctuations limited their distributions. Only two species of unionids were collected in 1-17 cm deep areas, and areas that became mudflats in September had almost no unionids. Numbers of zebra mussels and unionids were not correlated with organic content or silt/clay content of the sediments. Habitat characteristics shared by this wetland and other coastal wetlands that are important refuges of unionids include: a hydrological connection with the lake, areas deep enough for unionids to survive low water levels and soft sediments that allow unionid burrowing.

T1  - Pathways and Regulation of Aquatic Nuisance Species into British Columbia's Waterways
AN  - 17950396; 5870741
AB  - Aquatic nuisance species are of concern in British Columbia not only because of the extent of the province's marine coastline, but also because of the large network of freshwater lakes and rivers which support commercially important species. There are numerous pathways of introduction of nuisance species into British Columbia's aquatic systems. These include ballast water, the pet and aquarium trade, live seafood and transportation of pleasure boats from the Great Lakes area. There is limited documentation of the status of aquatic nuisance populations in the province. European Green Crab (Carcinus maenas), Zebra Mussels (Dreissena polymorpha), Eurasian Water Milfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum), Purple Loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria), Common Carp (Cyprinus carpio) and Spartina (Spartina alterniflora) are among the nuisance species that have been observed in British Columbia. Review of federal and provincial legislation that are applicable to limiting the intentional introduction of aquatic nuisance species shows that many regulatory gaps exist. For example, Schedule VIII, Section 5 of the Pacific Fisheries Regulations of the Canada Fisheries Act provides a list of prohibited live fish for importation. The adequacy of this list for the purpose of preventing the importation of species that might threaten local indigenous species needs to be examined. Present knowledge of aquatic nuisance species and their pathways of introduction provide a basis for updating some of these regulations.

T1  - Canadian action plan to address the threat of aquatic invasive species.
TT  - Proposition de plan d'action national contre les especes aquatiques envahissantes
AN  - 1846417842; PQ0003903382
AB  - The ultimate goal of this plan is to minimize (and ideally eliminate) the introduction of harmful AIS and remediate the impact of those already in Canada. The plan's underlying principles include incorporating environmental, economic, and social factors in decision making; working cooperatively with all stakeholders; and using science-based techniques to assess the risk of aquatic invasive species. Prevention of harmful new invasions is the first priority, as it is the most cost-effective way to deal with the problem. Once species are established, the task becomes far more complex and costly. The tools used to manage AIS must be carefully analyzed in terms of their effectiveness, how they affect the rest of the ecosystem, their cost, and so on. While some of the tools used to prevent and control harmful introductions vary between pathways, most of them apply across pathways, between jurisdictions, and to a range of species and ecosystems. In this plan, management actions have been organized into four broad categories: legislation, regulation and compliance; risk management ; engaging Canadians; and science.Original Abstract: Le plan dont il est ici question a pour objectif ultime de reduire, et idealement de stopper, l'introduction au Canada d'especes aquatiques envahissantes et de reparer les degats causes par celles qui sont deja etablies. Il s'appuie sur les principes suivants : integrer des considerations environnementales, sociales et economiques a la prise de decisions, etablir des liens de collaboration avec tous les intervenants et recourir a des methodes scientifiques pour evaluer le risque que presentent les especes aquatiques envahissantes. De toute evidence, la prevention de l'entree au pays de nouvelles especes nuisibles constitue la priorite et la facon la plus rentable de s'attaquer au probleme. Car, une fois qu'une telle espece est etablie, les mesures d'intervention deviennent beaucoup plus complexes et couteuses. Il est imperatif d'examiner avec soin les outils dont on dispose pour gerer les especes et ce, sur le plan de l'efficacite, des effets sur le reste de l'ecosysteme et des couts, entre autres. Certaines des mesures a prendre pour prevenir ou limiter l'entree d'especes nuisibles varient selon les voies d'entree, mais la plupart sont applicables par les differents paliers de competences a l'ensemble de ces voies ainsi qu'a une variete d'especes et d'ecosystemes. Aux fins de l'elaboration du plan canadien, les interventions ont ete divisees en quatre grandes categories : legislation, reglementation et leur application; gestion des risques; mobilisation des Canadiens, et recherche scientifique.

T1  - Effects of an invasive bivalve (Dreissena polymorpha) on fish in the Hudson River estuary.
AN  - 18063785; 6050087
AB  - Despite predictions that the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) invasion of North America would damage fisheries, analyses of actual effects on fish have been few and equivocal. 26 years of data on fish populations in the Hudson River are analyzed to quantify changes associated with the zebra mussel invasion. Based on measurements of changes in the lower food web, it is predicted that populations of open-water fish species (e.g., Alosa spp.) would suffer and populations of littoral fish species (e.g., Centrarchidae) would prosper from the Zebra mussel invasion. It was found that the median decrease in abundance of open-water species shifted downriver away from the Zebra mussel population, whereas those of littoral species shifted up river. Median apparent growth rates fell by 17% among open-water species and rose by 12% in the single littoral species studied. Many of the observed changes were large and involved species of commercial or recreational importance (e.g., American shad (Alosa sapidissima), black basses (Micropterus spp.)). The influence of zebra mussels on fish should vary widely across ecosystems as a function of system morphology, factors that limit primary production, and diets of the fish species.

T1  - Dreissenids in Lake St. Clair in 2001: Evidence for Population Regulation
AN  - 16187624; 6146822
AB  - Zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha [Pallas]) density was surveyed at 12 stations in Lake St. Clair in September 2001. Lake-wide mean density was 1,824 individuals/m super(2); whole wet biomass was 148 g/m super(2); and dry tissue biomass was 1.23 g/m super(2). Compared to historical data, density did not change significantly, whereas biomass showed a significant downward trend. Our data support the assertion that the zebra mussel population in Lake St. Clair has undergone important changes since the mid-1990s. Some areas of the lake are now juvenile-dominated, others are adult-dominated, and some have a balanced size distribution. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that zebra mussels have changed the lake ecosystem in two ways that have contributed to their own population limits in a density-dependent manner. First is the reduction of adult microhabitat due to the elimination of native mussels from the lake proper. Second is the massive redirection of larval settlement onto a greatly expanded aquatic macrophyte community which senesces and dies at the end of each season, thus decreasing survivorship of juvenile D. polymorpha. If sustained, these recent changes, especially biomass reduction, suggest that the impact of dreissenids on the Lake St. Clair ecosystem will be more moderate in the future.

T1  - Effects of zebra mussels on phytoplankton and ciliates: a field mesocosm experiment
AN  - 220276113
AB  - Many observational studies in North American lakes have documented decreases in phytoplankton abundance after the invasion of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha). However, few field experiments have examined in detail the effect of zebra mussels on phytoplankton abundance and species composition over an extended period. Replicated in situ mesocosms were used to evaluate the impact of natural densities of zebra mussels on phytoplankton and ciliate biovolume, and algal species composition over a 5-week period in a habitat that lacked extant mussel populations. Mussel biomass used in the experiment was determined using a regression model based on a data analysis that predicts zebra mussel biomass from total phosphorus concentration. Within 1 week, zebra mussels decreased phytoplankton biovolume by 53% and ciliate biovolume by 71%. The effect of zebra mussels on ciliate biovolume was sustained throughout the study. However, the effect of zebra mussels on phytoplankton abundance gradually waned over the remaining 4 weeks of the experiment, such that the declining effect of zebra mussels could not be explained by a shift towards less edible and/or faster growing algal species. The mussels' declining condition could help to explain the effect observed over the course of the experiment.

T1  - Review of techniques to prevent introduction of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) during native mussel (Unionoidea) conservation activities
AN  - 17826796; 5807572
AB  - Because of the declines in diversity and abundance of native freshwater mussels (superfamily Unionoidea), and the potential decimation of populations of native mussels resulting from the rapid spread of the exotic zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha, management options to eliminate or reduce the threat of the zebra mussel are needed. Relocating native mussels to refugia (artificial and natural) has been proposed to mitigate the threat of zebra mussels to native species. Relocation of native mussels to refugia such as fish hatchery facilities or natural habitats within their historic range, which are unlikely to be infested by zebra mussels, necessitates that protocols be developed to prevent the inadvertent introduction of zebra mussels. Several recent studies have developed such protocols, and have assessed their effectiveness on the health and survival of native mussels during subsequent relocation to various refugia. The purpose of this project is to synthesize and evaluate the current protocols and to develop a set of procedures that resource managers and researchers should consider before conducting conservation activities in zebra mussel infested waters. We found that the existing protocols have many common points of concern, such as facility modification and suitability, zebra mussel risk assessment and management procedures, and health and disease management procedures. These conservation protocols may have broad applicability to other situations and locations. A summary and evaluation of the information in these main areas, along with recommended guidelines, are presented in this article.

T1  - FISH-COMMUNITY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES FOR LAKE ERIE
AN  - 2102833453
AB  - The Lake Erie Committee (LEC), representing five fisheries-management agencies comprised of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Ontario have developed a set of fish-community goals and objectives for Lake Erie in accordance with the Joint Strategic Plan for Management of Great Lakes Fisheries (Great Lakes Fishery Commission 1997). Agencies recognized nine guiding principles during development related to selfsustaining stocks, the stock concept, indigenous species, aversion to introductions, preservation and restoration of habitat, preservation of rare and endangered species, recognition of naturalized species, requirement to harvest on a sustainable basis, and recognition of the limit on productivity. Lake Erie has had a long history of fish- community instability and subsequent change in its fisheries. Restoration of fish-community stability can be best achieved through management to promote healthy stocks of top predators, reduction in and/or prevention of the establishment of aquatic nuisance species, and protection and/or restoration of important coastal nearshore and tributary habitats. The LEC endorsed two goals. The first is to secure a balanced, predominantly cool-water fish community characterized by selfsustaining indigenous and naturalized species that occupy diverse habitats, provide valuable fisheries, and reflect a healthy ecosystem. Walleye (Stizostedion vitreum) would be a key predator in the western basin, central basin, and the nearshore waters of the eastern basin. The second goal is to secure a predominantly cold-water fish community in the deep, offshore waters of the eastern basin with lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), and burbot (Lota lota) as key predators. Further, the LEC has endorsed additional objectives concerning desired ecosystem conditions; the composition of fisheries and their link to supporting habitat; contaminants in fish; conservation of genetic diversity and of rare, threatened and endangered species; and the ecology of fish production. The committee strongly endorses the cooperative, inter-jurisdictional approach to fisheries management, as facilitated through the Great Lakes Fishery Commission (GLFC).

T1  - Predicting the impacts of an introduced species from its invasion history: an empirical approach applied to zebra mussel invasions
AN  - 19547293; 7258432
AB  - Quantitative models of impact are lacking for the vast majority of known invasive species, particularly in aquatic ecosystems. Consequently, managers lack predictive tools to help them prioritise invasion threats and decide where they can most effectively allocate limited resources. Predictive tools would also enhance the accuracy of water quality assessments, so that impacts caused by an invader are not erroneously attributed to other anthropogenic stressors. The invasion history of a species is a valuable guide for predicting the consequences of its introduction into a new environment. Regression analysis of data from multiple invaded sites can generate empirical models of impact, as is shown here for the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha. Dreissena's impacts on benthic invertebrate abundance and diversity follow predictable patterns that are robust across a range of habitat types and geographic regions. Similar empirical models could be developed for other invaders with a documented invasion history. Because an invader's impact is correlated with its abundance, a surrogate model may be generated (when impact data are unavailable) by relating the invader's abundance to environmental variables. Such a model could help anticipate which habitats will be most affected by invasion. Lack of precision should not be a deterrent to developing predictive models where none exist. Crude predictions can be refined as additional data become available. Empirical modelling is a highly informative and inexpensive, but underused, approach in the management of aquatic invasive species.

T1  - Planktonic invaders of the St. Lawrence estuarine transition zone: environmental factors controlling the distribution of zebra mussel veligers.
AN  - 19240648; 5811370
AB  - The St. Lawrence estuarine transition zone (ETZ) is a productive ecosystem supporting a larval fish nursery. Since 1994, Dreissena polymorpha veligers have become the dominant zooplankton (up to 260 individuals times L super(-1)). The environmental factors controlling their distribution across the ETZ and their potential impact on the plankton were determined. Their horizontal distribution was limited by salinity, with maximum decreases in concentration at 2%. A sharp decline in prey availability at >2% may be a secondary stressor for the veligers, in addition to the direct effects of salinity. Their vertical distribution was homogeneous throughout the water column, even in the presence of a pycnocline. Redundancy analysis showed that veliger concentrations were positively correlated with temperature and turbidity and negatively correlated with salinity and total phosphorus. Veligers were also positively correlated with chlorphyll a and picophytoplankton concentrations, suggesting little effect on their phytoplankton prey. Moreover, the veligers were positively correlated with the sestonic ratio of particulate to total phosphorus, indicating their positive association with good food quality. The veligers appear to have no severe negative impacts on the ETZ plankton community and are restricted to favourable conditions for their survival in the upstream, low salinity region of the ETZ.

Depuis 1994, les larves veligeres de Dreissena polymorpha ont envahi le plancton de cette zone (jusqu'a 260 individus.L super(- 1)). Cette etude documente les facteurs environnementaux controlant leur distribution dans la ZTE et leurs impacts sur la communaute phytoplanctonique. Leur distribution horizontale etait limitee par la salinite avec une diminution abrupte de leur abondance a 2 . Un declin simultane de la bio-disponibilite de leurs proies a >2 fut observe, impliquant que cette chute de bio-disponibilite pourrait constituer un stress additionnel a l'effet de la salinite. Leur distribution etait homogene dans toute la colonne d'eau, meme lors de la presence d'un gradient vertical de densite. Une analyse de redondance revele que les veligeres sont positivement correlees a la temperature et a la turbidite, mais negativement correlees a la salinite et au phosphore total. Les veligeres sont positivement correlees a leurs proies, i.e. a la biomasse de chlorophylle a et au picophytoplancton, impliquant qu'elles ne semblent pas avoir d'impacts severes sur leurs proies phytoplanctoniques. Les veligeres etaient positivement correlees au seston de bonne qualite alimentaire et semblaient etre associees aux conditions favorables pour leur croissance qui caracterisent les eaux de faibles salinites de la ZTE.

T1  - Potential Responses of Great Lakes Yellow Perch to Predation by Bass and Competition with Round Gobies and Eurasian Ruffe
AN  - 1521401593; 5800353
AB  - Since 1986, three Eurasian invaders, zebra mussels, Eurasian ruffe, and round gobies, have become well established in the Great Lakes nearshore environment, where they now reach high densities. We used laboratory experiments to investigate (1) competitive relationships among yellow perch, gobies, and ruffe, (2) whether growth and foraging of these fish species was affected by zebra mussels, and (3) the vulnerability of these fish species to predation by smallmouth bass. We also investigated their diet and habitat use in the upper Great Lakes. Perch growth was negatively affected by both intraspecific and interspecific competition. The presence of zebra mussels had no effect on growth of perch or ruffe, but may increase goby growth. Perch and ruffe are more vulnerable to predation by bass than gobies. Where food is limiting and predators are abundant, perch and ruffe may be more negatively affected than gobies by increased competition and predation. As zebra mussels, gobies, and ruffe spread in the Great Lakes, their ranges will overlap with perch and other benthic fishes, increasing the demand for common food resources like soft-bodied benthic invertebrates. Increased understanding of potential interactions among these invaders and benthic fishes will better inform fisheries management decisions.

T1  - Invasion of Onondaga Lake, New York, by the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) following reductions in N pollution
AN  - 16154005; 5560849
AB  - An initial failed invasion by the zebra mussel, followed by an abrupt shift to dense populations, is documented for polluted, hypereutrophic Onondaga Lake. The Lake is located in a region of New York subject to high infestation rates by the zebra mussel. Our analysis was supported by: 1) monitoring of multiple life stages of the zebra mussel, including veligers, pediveliger deposition, and adults in the lake and an adjoining source river over a 4-y interval, 2) a quantitative substrate survey of the lake's nearshore zone, 3) in situ growth-rate experiments, and 4) long-term water-quality monitoring data for the lake. Despite the availability of appropriate substrate and food, near-optimal temperature and primary water chemistry requirements, and continuing inputs of veligers since the early 1990s, veliger concentrations (<0.2 individuals/L) and adult densities in the nearshore zone (<1 individual/m super(2)) remained extremely low in the lake through 1998. This failure was caused by the toxic effects on early life stages from high lake concentrations of forms of N, particularly total ammonia (T-NH sub(3)) and free (unionized) ammonia (NH sub(3)), associated with discharges of a domestic wastewater-treatment plant (WWTP). The abrupt shift from extremely low to high densities in the summer of 1999 continued through 2000 (maximum of similar to 65,000 individuals/m super(2)), coincident with abrupt decreases in concentrations of T-NH sub(3) and NH sub(3) associated with increased treatment at the WWTP. Water-quality monitoring data suggested that summertime T-NH sub(3) and NH sub(3) concentrations of similar to 2 and 0.05 mg/L, respectively, were adequate to prevent the development of dense zebra mussel populations in the lake. The establishment of dense populations of zebra mussels in Onondaga Lake may complicate the resolution of impacts/benefits of an ongoing rehabilitation program to remediate domestic waste inputs in the lake.

T1  - Eurasian Ruffe, Round Gobies, and Zebra Mussels: Will the "Exotic Triad" Spell Trouble for Great Lakes Yellow Perch?
AN  - 18660349; 5560033
AB  - Eurasian invaders, Eurasian ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernuus), round gobies (Neogobius melanostomus), and zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha), which we term the "exotic triad" may substantially impact benthic communities due to their locally high abundances and expanding distributions in the Great Lakes. Ruffe and gobies may compete among themselves, as well as with native fish, for benthic prey, refuge, and spawning sites. Furthermore, native fishes that have shown population declines, such as Lake Michigan yellow perch (Perca flavescens), may be adversely affected by increased competition for benthic resources. Our objective was to determine potential ecological impacts of the "exotic triad" on the benthic ecosystem and on perch. Laboratory experiments examining competition for habitat and field analysis of gut contents have revealed significant overlap in habitat use and food resources. Ongoing experiments are testing for competition for limited food resources among these fishes in the presence and absence of zebra mussels, which increase habitat heterogeneity and serve as an auxiliary food source for gobies. Our research will lead to an understanding of the potential impacts of the "exotic triad" on the Great Lakes and help to inform fisheries management decisions.

T1  - Changes in the benthic algal community and nutrient limitation in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron, during the invasion of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha)
AN  - 18428452; 5408555
AB  - We conducted a series of nutrient manipulation experiments over the first 5 y of Dreissena colonization in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron, to evaluate benthic algal nutrient limitation and community composition. We placed nutrient-diffusing substrata in the littoral zone of the Bay during 1991 (early Dreissena colonization) and from 1992 to 1995 (post-Dreissena colonization). The treatments consisted of P, N, and P+N additions, and a control. Chlorophyll a decreased through time from 1992 to 1995. Phosphorus limited biovolume only in 1994. Treatments with P additions had significantly more chlorophyll a than the controls each year after 1992. This result was consistent with an observed decrease in dissolved P throughout the study. Nitrogen additions had no significant effect throughout the 5-y period. Major shifts in species composition did not result from nutrient additions but rather seemed to be consistent with changes in light penetration and Dreissena herbivory. Our data demonstrated that the pre-Dreissena benthic algal community was dominated by tychoplanktonic diatoms (i.e., Aulacoseira granulata and Tabellaria fenestrata), which would be susceptible to filter-feeding Dreissena. Early post-invasion conditions were marked by an increase in light penetration, and benthic algae were dominated by filamentous green algae (mostly Spirogyra sp.). Late post-invasion conditions were marked by a reduction of light caused by planktonic blooms of Microcystis sp., which were resistant to zebra mussel herbivory. The benthic algal dominance shifted to periphytic diatoms (i.e., Gomphonema clevei), which were also resistant to zebra mussel filter-feeding. A new equilibrium may be developing where Dreissena herbivory limits tychoplanktonic diatoms, which promotes Microcystis bloom, which in turn limits Dreissena filtering rates.

T1  - The effect of siltation on distribution of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) in Alum Creek, Westerville, Ohio
AN  - 17782931; 5607208
AB  - Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) were accidentally introduced into the United States in 1986. Since then, they have been classified as a nuisance species because: 1) they are introduced; 2) they form large populations; and 3) they out-competenative species. In Ohio, zebra mussels were originally found in Lake Erie. Since then, they have spread to rivers and creeks, including Alum Creek in Westerville, Ohio. This study examines the microhabitat of zebra mussels in a creek, relative to flow characteristics. Changes in flow affect the amount of silt deposited on the substrate in a creek. The distributions of zebra mussels at two sites on Alum Creek are being determined by quadrat sampling. Turbidity, sedimentation rates, depth, and flow characteristics are being measured at each of these sites. If zebra mussels are limited by high amounts of silt deposition, then we would expect them to be absent in pool habitats where silt deposition is greatest, and present in riffle and run habitats where deposition is less. Initial observations have shown that zebra mussels were not found on the tops of rocks in pool habitats where settlement rates of silt were high. However, they were found on the top surface of rocks in riffle habitats where silt deposition was less.

T1  - Interactions among Zebra Mussel Shells, Invertebrate Prey, and Eurasian Ruffe or Yellow Perch
AN  - 18846197; 5574432
AB  - The exotic zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, is established in all of the Laurentian Great Lakes and may affect benthivorous fishes by increasing the complexity of benthic substrates and changing energy flow patterns within the food web. Native yellow perch, Perca flavescens, and the non-indigenous Eurasian ruffe, Gymnocephalus cernuus, are benthivores that may compete for limited food resources. As ruffe spread to areas with more dense zebra mussel populations, the zone of interaction among zebra mussels, yellow perch, and ruffe will increase and intensify. In the laboratory, the effect of zebra mussel shells on the ability of these fishes to forage on amphipods (Gammarus pseudolimnaeus) and chironomids (Chironomus plumosus) was examined in light and darkness. In 12 h, ruffe consumed more amphipods than did similar-sized yellow perch, particularly in darkness on bare cobble, and in light within zebra mussels. Amphipods decreased activity more in the presence of ruffe than yellow perch. More amphipods were found in zebra mussel shells than in bare cobble, whether or not fish were present. In darkness, when ruffe consumed more amphipods on bare cobble, amphipods became more associated with zebra mussel shells. Although ruffe consumed more amphipods than yellow perch, perch consumed more chironomids than ruffe on bare cobble. The presence of zebra mussel shells altered the relative consumption of invertebrates in some substrate-light combinations. Experiments such as these help to improve understanding of the direct and indirect effects of predation between and among native and non-indigenous species that may exert structuring forces on the nearshore communities of the Great Lakes currently or in the future.

T1  - Black Sea - Baltic Sea invasion corridors
AN  - 17823905; 6233721
AB  - The Black and Baltic seas are geologically-young, brackish seas, that have undergone drastic changes since the end of the Ice Age in size and shape, hydrological and hydrochemical regimes, and connections with neighbouring seas. Their ecosystems are still undergoing changes, due to maturation processes. Consequently, most animal and plant species living in the Baltic and Black seas are postglacial immigrants, many of them living close to their salinity tolerance limits. The process of natural enrichment of their biota with invading species (spontaneously or by means of passive dispersal) from the adjacent, more saline seas still continues. From a biogeographical point of view, both basins represent isolated "ecological islands", separated from other brackish water bodies by physical and ecological barriers, such as land masses and fully marine waters. These barriers has been breached two hundred years ago, with the construction of the first invasion corridor. An invasion corridor is defined here as a regular human-mediated connection between isolated biogeographical regions, that cuts through natural environmental barriers and enables transfer of alien species. An invasion corridor may be established in different ways e.g., as high volume overseas shipping, transporting species in ballast tanks or on ship hulls, frequent air or surface transportation of species for stocking, seeds, or as an inland waterway. This paper is a brief overview of the history and functioning of the inland aquatic invasion corridors between the Baltic and the Black seas, and including the Caspian and the White seas as parts of the Eastern European system of invasion corridors.

T1  - Dreissena (D.) polymorpha: Evolutionary origin and biological peculiarities as prerequisites of invasion success
AN  - 17525982; 6410359
AB  - The evolution of Dreissena polymorpha took place in changeable conditions in the successive series of Paratethys Great Lakes and Seas and their estuaries. Complicated intraspecific structure of species and sufficient divergence in environmental requirements among its subspecies allows Dreissena polymorpha to inhabit a variety of environmental conditions in its native area, the Ponto-Aralo-Caspian region. The only subspecies, Dreissena p. polymorpha, is known as an amphiatlantic invader in fresh and oligohaline waters of Europe and North America. Wide and fast dispersal and the successful establishment of this subspecies are facilitated both by biological peculiarities of the zebra mussel (e.g. unusual for freshwater bivalve mode of life, wide limits of environmental requirements, genetic polymorphism) and availability of man-mediated vectors.

T1  - Responses of Onondaga Lake, New York, to Early Stages of Rehabilitation: Unanticipated Ecosystem Feedbacks
AN  - 19811476; 5707090
AB  - Responses of polluted Onondaga Lake, New York, to early stages of a phased program to rehabilitate the lake from the effects of domestic waste inputs are documented. The analysis is based on more than 10 years of paired monitoring of the effluent (total ammonia and total phosphorus) of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) that discharges to the lake as well as the lake itself (including total ammonia, nitrite, total and dissolved forms of phosphorus, plankton biomass and composition, Secchi disc transparency, and zebra mussel density). Major reductions in total ammonia and total phosphorus loading relative to the preceding decade are reported for the WWTP for the November 1998 through October 1999 interval. Dramatic and, in some cases, unanticipated changes in the lake's water quality and biota in response to the reductions in loading are documented for the April to October interval of 1999 including: (1) major decreases in total ammonia concentrations and improved status with respect to ammonia toxicity standards, (2) development of dense populations of zebra mussels, (3) decreases in fall concentrations of nitrite and improved status with respect to the related toxicity standard, (4) decreases in total phosphorus and total dissolved phosphorus concentrations, and (5) a severe Microcystis (phytoplankton) bloom that caused nuisance conditions and poor clarity. The zebra mussel invasion is attributed to the reductions in total ammonia concentrations to below toxic levels. The Microcystis bloom was probably related to the abrupt increase in the zebra mussel population. Additional reductions in phosphorus loading from the WWTP will be required to limit phytoplankton production and avoid the potential for continued nuisance conditions. Potential complications in resolving lake responses to future reductions in loading associated with the zebra mussel invasion are considered.

T1  - River Dissolved Oxygen Model with Zebra Mussel Oxygen Demand (ZOD)
AN  - 18186025; 5206006
AB  - The development, calibration, and application of a dynamic two-dimensional mass balance model for dissolved oxygen (DO) for rivers are documented for the first time accommodating the oxygen demand associated with zebra mussels. The test system is a short (2.3 km) phytoplankton-rich section of the Seneca River, N.Y., which is believed to represent an upper bound of the impact of this exotic invader on oxygen resources because of the unusually high population densities and limited turbulent mixing that prevail. Model calibration is supported by comprehensive measurements of DO, which resolve diurnal and seasonal patterns, and various forcing conditions over a four-month period. Wide temporal variations in the areal consumption rate of DO by zebra mussels [zebra mussel oxygen demand (ZOD), g times m super(-2) times day super(-1)] were determined through model calibration. These determinations are supported by closure with earlier estimates based on simple DO budget calculations, and with laboratory biomass-specific oxygen consumption rates published in the scientific literature. Values of ZOD at times (e.g., >50 g times m super(-2) times day super(-1)) were an order of magnitude greater than the sediment oxygen demand associated with organically enriched deposits. The model performs well in simulating important features of the complex patterns of DO observed, including (1) DO depletion across the study section; (2) vertical DO stratification; and (3) diurnal changes. ZOD was the dominant sink for DO over the river study section; it was entirely responsible for the substantial observed DO depletion, and it was the major cause of the DO stratification during periods of low flow. A preliminary extension of the model is demonstrated to be successful in simulating the persistence of DO depletion 15 km downstream. The model is expected to have management utility for this and other phytoplankton-rich rivers that have been, or will be, invaded by zebra mussels.

T1  - Comparison of conservation strategies for unionids threatened by zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha): periodic cleaning vs quarantine and translocation
AN  - 17910875; 5140035
AB  - Native unionid mussel populations have recently declined throughout North America as a result of zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) fouling. Periodic cleaning of fouled unionids and cleaning followed by translocation have been suggested as methods for reducing mortality. Leptodea fragilis and Potamilus alatus were used to determine survival, recovery of energetic stores, and accumulation of newly settled zebra mussels after cleaning and replacement in situ. Both species had high survival, and L. fragilis increased energetic stores after cleaning. Elliptio complanata and Lampsilis radiata were used to compare conservation strategies for unionids fouled by zebra mussels. Survival and glycogen content were used to evaluate stress induced by cleaning and replacement in situ, cleaning and translocation, and cleaning, quarantine, and translocation, relative to the stress in fouled unionids and control (never fouled) unionids. New zebra mussel settlement was assessed to estimate the frequency of cleanings needed. Cleaned E. complanata and L. radiata maintained significantly higher glycogen levels and had higher survival than fouled unionids in all treatments; however, 30% of L. radiata died while in quarantine but no E. complanata died. Translocated unionids were difficult to relocate in the riverine refugium. The inability to find translocated unionids, coupled with high survival and energetic stores in cleaned and replaced unionids, indicate that cleaning and replacement is an effective conservation strategy. Cleaning and replacement may be used as the 1st step to conserve small populations of fouled unionids living in environments where food is not limiting and where collection and cleaning are logistically feasible.

T1  - Diets and Diet Overlap of Nonindigenous Gobies and Small Benthic Native Fishes Co-inhabiting the St. Clair River, Michigan
AN  - 18205892; 5282954
AB  - Round gobies (Neogobius melanostomus), after successfully reproducing in the early 1990s, decimated populations of mottled sculpins (Cottus bairdi) and possibly logperch (Percina caprodes) in the St. Clair River. Studies were conducted during 1994 to determine whether diets of round and tubenose (Proterorhinus marmoratus) gobies overlapped with those of native forage fishes. In the nearshore zone (depth less than or equal to 1 m), round and tubenose gobies, logperch, and rainbow darters (Etheostoma caeruleum) of similar sizes (total lengths < 75 mm) consumed mainly small-sized macroinvertebrates (dipterans, Caenis, and amphipods) during June 1994. Logperch and rainbow darters were present in the nearshore zone only during this month. At the crest of the channel slope (depth = 3 m), round gobies and northern madtoms (Noturus stigmosus) ate mostly ephemeropteran nymphs (Hexagenia and Baetisca), while predation on zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) and other mollusks by round gobies was minimal. Northern madtoms did not feed on mollusks. Diet overlap between round gobies and native fishes was not observed at the channel slope (depth = 5 m and 7 m) due to heavy predation on mollusks by round gobies. Young-of-the-year (YOY) round gobies migrated to deeper water in autumn and became prey of mottled sculpins and northern madtoms. Eggs and YOY of mottled sculpins may have become vulnerable to predation by both round gobies and native fishes in deeper water, since adult mottled sculpins were apparently confined to the channel with limited home range because aggressive round gobies occupied preferred shallow habitat, including spawning sites.

T1  - Impact of Zebra Mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) on Fingernail Clams (Sphaeriidae) in Extreme Southern Lake Michigan
AN  - 18077949; 5160095
AB  - The demography of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) and its impacts on native fingernail clams (Sphaeriidae) in Lake Michigan near Michigan City, Indiana were studied from 1992 to 1997 at 5, 10, and 15 m depths. Zebra mussel densities ranged from 0 to 6,209/m super(2), and were greatest at deeper stations. Size-frequency distributions suggest that initial colonization of the Michigan City area occurred in 1991, with adults typically living for 2 to 3 years. Abundance of adult populations may be limited by the sandy habitat typical of the areas studied and the occasional high-energy wave action in the shallow (5 m) near-shore zone of this area. Densities of fingernail clam ranged from 0 to 1,312/m super(2) and were also greatest at deeper stations. Approximately half of the fingernail clams shells between 1 and 2 mm in size were used as substrate for attachment by juvenile and adult zebra mussels, while over 90% of the clams > 2 mm showed attachment by zebra mussels. Overall median densities of Sphaeriidae decreased from 832/m super(2) to 13/m super(2) at the 15 m depth and from 234/m super(2) to 0/m super(2) at the 10 m depth during the study. It appears that zebra mussel colonization caused a dramatic reduction of Sphaeriidae density by 1997 that may eventually result in their loss from the area.

T1  - Translocation of zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha Pallas) as a tool to monitor heavy metals in the River Danube.
AN  - 1521380139; 5530770
AB  - Relative methods, which are based on comparisons using controls, appear to be the most reliable methods for monitoring the complex and ever-changing conditions of the river ecosystem. The translocation of mussels to monitor heavy metals, one of the most frequently used active biomonitoring techniques, is the best example of this type of assessment. This technique cannot eliminate all uncertainties associated with the study of local organisms, but it can reduce them significantly. The methods developed for smaller streams need careful investigation and confirmation before they can be applied to larger rivers. Because of the decrease in local populations and their heterogeneous distribution, active biomonitoring techniques seem to be effective and reliable in monitoring programs for large rivers. Due to its flexible and modular-like construction, the "Dreissena-basket" is easy to handle and provides an appropriate quantity of good quality mussels for analytical procedures in the permanently changing hydrological conditions of a large river. Using this device, many methodological problems can be overcome and the variability accompanied with passive techniques can be reduced. Using the correlation equations of shell length and body weight to calculate the differences between the measured and calculated body weight, we could differenciate between seasonal changes and changes in environmental conditions. It seems that within the narrow size range of selected mussel groups, small changes in dry weight could be disregarded as factors resulting from changes in heavy metal concentrations in the soft tissues. A way to decrease variability caused by dry weight changes is to recover the test animals and to replace them by new stocks of mussels collected in the same consecutive periods. Thereby, mussels can monitor both shorter and longer events of pollution. Both the longer sections and the hot spots of pollution in the Danube could be discovered using Dreissena baskets". The northern border section (1,842 rkm), the sections of the Medve-Nagymaros (1,806-1,695 rkm) and the Paks-Mohacs (1,532-1,447 rkm) proved to be polluted by most of the heavy metals studied. These sections are adjacent to the most industrialized regions of the Slovak Republic and Hungary.

T1  - Macroinvertebrates of a Rocky Shore in the Freshwater Tidal Hudson River
AN  - 17610722; 4746032
AB  - We studied the macroinvertebrate fauna of a rocky shore in the freshwater tidal Hudson River during 1992-1994, the early years of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) invasion. The macroinvertebrate community was numerically dominated by chironomids, nematodes, oligochaetes, gastropods, zebra mussels, and planarian flatworms. The community was a mixture of species typical of stony warm water rivers and lake shores, freshwater generalists, and semiterrestrial species. Overall macroinvertebrate densities were moderate to low (2,800-14,600 m super(-2)). Density was a strong function of season and elevation, with consistently low densities in the early spring and in the intertidal zone. This pattern suggests that physical harshness (alternating submergence and desiccation; ice and low temperatures) limits the distribution of invertebrates at this site. Zebra mussels occurred at our study site chiefly below the low tide mark, but only at moderate abundance (usually <1,000 m super(-2)). A weak correlation between the densities of zebra mussels and those of other macroinvertebrates nonetheless suggests that the zebra mussel invasion may have affected community structure.

T1  - FISH-COMMUNITY OBJECTIVES FOR LAKE ONTARIO
AN  - 2102827469
AB  - This document summarizes a scientific consensus on major factors influencing the fish community of Lake Ontario, describes the results of public discussion on possible futures for the fish community, and outlines binational (whole-lake) fish-community objectives. These objectives will be used as a guide by New York and Ontario to carry out their mandates to manage the fish and fisheries of Lake Ontario. Lake Ontario supports diverse recreational, commercial, and aboriginal fisheries. Total annual expenditures by anglers participating in Lake Ontario recreational fisheries were estimated at $53 million (Canadian) for Ontario waters in 1995 and $71 million (U.S.) for New York waters in 1996. The predominantly Canadian commercial fishery had a landed value in 1996 of $1.5 million (Canadian). Nutrients have declined in Lake Ontario, and the recent invasion of zebra and quagga mussels has caused changes in how nutrients are cycled through food webs. These changes have decreased alewife productivity. Alewife biomass reached a 20-yr low in 1997, and further declines are likely.

T1  - Effects of temperature and temperature acclimation on survival of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) and Asian clams (Corbicula fluminea) under extreme hypoxia
AN  - 195526783
AB  - Following acclimation to 5[degrees], 15[degrees] or 25[degrees]C for 14 days, samples of 30 Dreissena polymorpha (zebra mussels) and Corbicula fluminea (Asian clams)  were held in either aerated (control) or extremely hypoxic N<2< gassed water (PO2 <  3% of full air saturation). Mortality was negligible in all aerated controls. Mean hypoxia  tolerance in D. polymorpha ranged from 3-4 days at 25[degrees]C to 38-42  days at 5[degrees]C. Hypoxia tolerance time of zebra mussels increased significantly with declining  test temperature (P < 0.001) and increasing acclimation temperature (P < 0.001). Larger  zebra mussels were more tolerant than smaller individuals. Asian clams were 2-7 times  more tolerant of hypoxia than zebra mussels, surviving a mean of 11.8 and 35.1 days at  25[degrees]C and 15[degrees]C, respectively, and without mortality for 84 days at 5[degrees]C, and were  not influenced by temperature acclimation. At 25[degrees]C, larger specimens of Asian clams were  less tolerant of hypoxia than smaller individuals. Both species are amongst the least hypoxia  tolerant freshwater bivalve molluscs, reflecting their prevalence in well-oxygenated shallow  water habitats. Prolonged exposure to extreme hypoxia may provide an efficacious control  strategy, particularly for D. polymorpha

T1  - Zebra Mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) Colonization in a Thermally Stratified Reservoir and Its Ecological Impacts
AN  - 17574254; 4468225
AB  - A comprehensive research project was conducted in Hargus Lake, Ohio, from 1993 to 1996 to investigate the consequences of zebra mussel colonization in this small thermally stratified reservoir. This project comprised long-term monitoring of lake physicochemical and biological parameters and a series of in situ experiments. Four major study areas were covered: (1) the effects of lake stratification and associated hypolimnetic hypoxia on zebra mussels' survival and growth. (2) the grazing impact of zebra mussels on phytoplankton. (3) the role of zebra mussels in sedimentation and nutrient removal. (4) the impacts of zebra mussel colonization on lake thermal and oxygen structures. Lack of solid substrates was the limiting factor of zebra mussel colonization in Hargus Lake, though hypoxic conditions negatively influenced zebra mussels' growth and survival. The grazing impact of zebra mussels on phytoplankton was very limited, largely due to their limited accessibility to phytoplankton and high degree of refiltration under relatively static hydrodynamic conditions. a new approach was developed to evaluate zebra mussels' in situ effective clearance rate that reflects the grazing impact on phytoplankton more accurately than the traditional method using filtration rate estimation. Zebra mussels played a critical role in accelerating the sedimentation of suspended particles and nutrients, making the water clearer. The water clearing process was further assisted by expanded growth of macrophytes, which benefitted from and contributed to improved water clarity. in response to increased light penetration, water temperature and dissolved oxygen in the epilimnion increased. All these interactions cooperated to produce a series of positive feedback processes, which resulted in simultaneous increases in mussel density, macrophyte distribution and epilimnion depth. The changes in lake thermal, oxygen structures and nutrient dynamics are more profound to the lake ecosystem than the direct trophic interactions involving zebra mussels. It is concluded that the impacts of zebra mussels should be assessed from a broad ecosystem perspective.

T1  - Resolution of issues of scope and detail in the development of the Lake Erie ecological model
AN  - 18356408; 5317891
AB  - The Lake Erie Ecological Model (LEEM) arose as a modeling framework to address both scientific and management uncertainties about causes of recent instabilities of the Lake Erie ecosystem. Model design and implementation decisions were guided and reviewed by a group of managers and scientists under the aegis of the International Joint Commissions' Lake Erie Task Force. Design criteria required that the model provide a framework for joint consideration of lake-wide effects of invasion of zebra mussels, declining phosphorus loading, continuing toxic contamination, and fish harvesting on the structure of the fish community of Lake Erie. Meeting these criteria required explicit representation of trophic structure and nutrient limitations on primary production. Solutions to the problems of deciding on scope and resolution of the model are discussed. These trade-off decisions about model design have important implications for the scientific and practical usefulness of the modeling framework.

T1  - Effects of zebra mussels on P-limitation of phytoplankton assemblages in Lake Erie
AN  - 18266672; 5317844
AB  - Since 1980 the management of Lake Erie water quality has been predicated on the assumption that phytoplankton communities are P-limited. Our past research using 8 L experimental enclosures indicated zebra mussels (ZM) are selective grazers that release large quantities of phosphate which may stimlate growth of inedible cyanophytic phytoplankton (e.g. Microcystis). The purpose of this study was to determine whether ZM released sufficient quantities of available P to relieve natural phytoplankton assemblages from P-limitation. We compared phytoplankton communities in the western basin of Lake Erie at sites that differed in density of ZM populations, sampling the water column of each site both at 1 m depth and at a stratum 1 m above the bottom. We assessed P-limitation of phytoplankton using physiological characteristics: phosphate uptake rate, P-debt, and Phosphorus Deficiency Index (PDI). We found that phytoplankton communities in the vicinity of dense ZM populations are significantly less P-limited than similar communities removed even by several meters. Our findings suggest ZM are able to affect natural phytoplankton assemblages as they affect phytoplankton under experimental conditions in small enclosures, but this effect is not widespread. This study was supported by Ohio Sea Grant and Lake Erie Protection Fund.

T1  - Light limitation as the key factor controlling benthic recruitment to summer Microcystis bloom in western Lake Erie
AN  - 18265394; 5318045
AB  - Summer algal blooms are of special interest because they are often dominated by toxic cyanobaterial species such as Microcystis, Anabeana, Nodularia, etc. Some blue-green algae have been shown to develop on the sediments and then ascend into the water column when light levels become adequate. In western Lake Erie, Microcystis-dominated summer algal blooms have occurred in past years. Recent changes such as increase in zebra mussel abundance and light intensity may have altered environmental conditions of the lake to favor certain algal species. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of light intensity on the benthic recruitment to summer algal bloom in western Lake Erie. Phytoplankton samples were collected every meter from the surface to the bottom at two sites of the western Lake Erie biweekly between June and August in 1996. The shallow site has a rocky bottom with maximum depth of 5 m, while the deep site has a muddy bottom with maximum depth of 13 m. Light intensity was also measured every meter at both sites meter with underwater quantum sensor. Results suggest that abundant blue-green algae (mostly Microcystis spp.) were found on the bottom of both sites, but surface bloom was only observed in the shallow site.

T1  - In situ survival and growth of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) under chronic hypoxia in a stratified lake
AN  - 17384856; 4603147
AB  - Experiments and field surveys were conducted in Hargus Lake (Ohio, U.S.) to investigate the effect of lake stratification on the survival, growth and distribution of zebra mussels. During the lake stratification period, relatively stable temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO) gradients persisted across the water column, allowing us to examine the chronic effect of hypoxia on zebra mussels. Zebra mussels were incubated in cages and suspended at different depths in the water column at both pelagic (max. depth = 12 m) and littoral (max. depth = 3.5 m) sites from April 18 to September 28, 1994. No mussel survived to the end of the experiment in cages greater than or equal to 5.5 m, whereas the highest survival rate (76%) occurred at 5 m depth where temperature and DO remained fairly stable for at least 3 months. The threshold oxygen level for survival was between 1.0-1.7 mg 1 super(-1) when water temperature was at about 17-18 degree C. While zebra mussels' survival rate was not affected under the sublethal hypoxic conditions, their growth was greatly retarded by poor water quality. The field survey showed that the zebra mussels and macrophytes had about the same distribution and their biomasses were positively related. The percentage of mussels in aggregates increased towards their maximum distribution depth. The maximum distribution depth of the naturally occurring zebra mussels was only 2.8 m, whereas the adult mussels could survive the entire stratification period when being artificially placed on the 3.5 m bottom, and young mussels could colonize the 3.5 m bottom if solid substrates were provided. We conclude that lack of substrate, rather than hypoxia, was the limiting factor of zebra mussel distribution above 5 m depth in Hargus Lake.

T1  - The Effects of Zebra Mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) Introduction on the Benthos and Yellow Perch (Perca flavescens) of Oneida Lake, New York
AN  - 17166397; 4468048
AB  - Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha), an exotic bivalve were discovered in Oneida Lake, NY in 1991. Some researchers have speculated that the changes that zebra mussels cause may have negative consequences for fish populations in the Laurentian Great Lakes and adjacent inland waters because they may direct energy from the pelagic to benthic zones. I studied the effects of zebra mussel introduction on the benthic invertebrates and yellow perch (Perca flavescens) of Oneida Lake. Yellow perch are ecologically important and support popular sport fisheries in Oneida Lake and many other North American Lakes. The effects that zebra mussels have had on aquatic systems can best be classified as ecosystem engineering. Ecosystem engineers are organisms that alter habitat or control availability of resources to other organisms. The most striking effect that zebra mussels had on Oneida Lake was a significant increase in water clarity and light penetration into the water column. This is a lake-wide effect, not limited to the areas near mussel clusters. Densities of two grazing benthic invertebrates increased in shallow, relative to deep areas, but absolute density, did not exceed historical levels. Laboratory experiments and field data also suggest that increased light penetration may increase the foraging success of yellow perch on zooplankton and benthic invertebrate prey. Experiments show that mussel clusters have had local scale effects on invertebrate density and the foraging success of yellow perch. Invertebrate density rises in response to zebra mussel shell density. Yellow perch foraging success decreased in the presence of mussel clusters. Long-term data do not suggest that there has been a change in consumption of benthos or zooplankton by YOY yellow perch. The number of YOY yellow perch did not change in association with zebra mussel introduction, but growth rates have increased. Neither the number, nor the growth rates of adult yellow perch have changed since zebra mussel establishment. Thus, it does not appear that my hypothesis concerning increased consumption of benthic invertebrates by yellow perch was correct. However, I showed that there was no evidence of negative effects of zebra mussel establishment on yellow perch in Oneida Lake.

T1  - Physical factors that limit the distribution and abundance of Dreissena polymorpha (Pall.)
AN  - 17311531; 4571233
AB  - Dreissena polymorpha, the zebra mussel, originated in the Caspian and Black Sea basin, and has invaded waterbodies of the Former Soviet Union (FSU), eastern, and western Europe during the last 200 years. Since 1771 more than 2,000 papers on the distribution, taxonomy, biology, ecology, and control of species and subspecies of Dreissena were published in Russia and FSU, however, this work has not been generally available. We review work conducted in the FSU over the last 100 years on the tolerance of D. polymorpha to different abiotic conditions in waterbodies of various types in order to provide non-Russian-speaking scientists access to this rich body of literature. D. polymorpha is one of the few bivalve molluscs well adapted to live from entirely fresh water to brackish waters. Different subspecies appear to have different salinity tolerances, ranging from completely fresh water to 18.5%. Zebra mussels require at least 25% oxygen saturation, although they can survive several days in anaerobic conditions. The quagga mussel, D. bugensis, however, is much more tolerant of low oxygen conditions. The upper temperature limit for zebra mussels is around 32-34 degree C. Zebra mussels are most abundant on hard surfaces, particularly rocky surfaces, and on macrophytes. Water motion, aerial exposure, freezing, and the other physical factors including temperature, salinity, and oxygen affect the distribution of zebra mussels among and within waterbodies. Many of these factors are expected to covary, or differ predictably among waterbodies, driving distribution and abundance patterns as well as patterns of invasibility that we see both within and among waterbodies.

T1  - Impact of the Zebra Mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, on Pelagic Lower Trophic Food Web Dynamics of a Large Freshwater Ecosystem
AN  - 16542101; 4241915
AB  - This study examines the impact of the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, on the nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton interactions in Oneida Lake. I also explore interactions among lower food web components and juvenile fishes. Zebra mussels were first observed in late summer of 1991, and were established within the benthic community by 1992. I used a six-year data set (1990-95) to analyze trophic interactions with a primary focus on the phytoplankton-zooplankton levels. Differences in measured and estimated parameters among groups of years (i.e., no, low, and high zebra mussel biomass) were used to determine whether zebra mussels have impacted nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton dynamics. Primary productivity was estimated using the [14] C incubation method in 1993 and 1994. No estimates were available for other years used in the analysis. Therefore, empirically based multivariate equations were developed to predict primary productivity in the other years. Changes that occurred in Oneida Lake after the establishment of zebra mussels included an 86% increase in water clarity. The limiting nutrient, phosphorus, expressed as total phosphorus was variable with no clear trend. Phytoplankton biomass, indexed as chlorophyll a, decreased by 55% from no to high zebra mussel years. Primary productivity did not change significantly throughout the study period but there was a community change to relatively more nanoplankton. A 133% increase in daphnid biomass and a 54% increase in secondary production occurred following zebra mussel invasion. Growth of YOY yellow perch, the main planktivore, increased in response to decline in perch abundance due to increased predation pressure by walleye, and was not a zebra mussel effect. A ten compartment predator-prey model was developed to simulate the response of food web dynamics to zebra mussels grazing on the pelagic system. The model demonstrated that under varying predation pressure from planktivores and a second grazer such as zebra mussels, top-down and bottom-up effects can be induced. The model showed that daphnid populations under most scenarios were more sensitive to predation pressure by planktivores than to loss of resources to a competitor. The model also implicated the importance of detrital pools in regulating stability in an aquatic ecosystem.

T1  - Effects of temperature and chronic hypoxia on survivorship of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) and Asian clam (Corbicula fluminae)
AN  - 16490372; 4367543
AB  - The effects were examined of 4 levels of chronic hypoxic stress at 3 different temperatures on the survivorship of Dreissena polymorpha and Corbicula fluminea to assess the efficacy of O sub(2) deprivation as a macrofouling control treatment and examine if critical hypoxia limits support reported distribution patterns. At 25 degree C, the hypoxia tolerance was examined at P sub(O2) identical with 7.9, 11.9, 15.9, 23.8, and 31.8 Torr or 5, 7.5, 10, 15, and 20% of full air O sub(2) saturation. At 15 degree C, the hypoxia tolerance to 7.9, 11.9, and 15.9 Torr was tested and at 7.9 Torr for 5 degree C treatments. For both species, P sub(O2) and temperature influenced survivorship dramatically with increasing survivorship at higher P sub(O2) and decreasing temperatures. At 25 degree C, C. fluminea experienced mortality at 7.9, 11.9, and 15.9 Torr, with LT sub(50) values of 144, 216, and 216 h, respectively, versus 288, 384, and 480 h for the 15 degree C exposures. Dreissena polymorpha treatments had LT sub(50) values of 120, 216, and 216 h at 25 degree C for the 7.9-, 11.9-, and 15.9-Torr treatments versus 26 % mortality after 600 h and 28% mortality after 720 h at 15 degree C. The 7.9-Torr treatments at 5 degree C had LT sub(50) values of 480 h for C. fluminea and 1056 h for D. polymorpha. This study showed that both species displayed broad seasonal variation in hypoxia tolerance and that hypoxia limits may be used to assess infestation risk.

T1  - Dispersal and ecological impact of zebra mussels, Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas), in coupled lake-stream systems
AN  - 16247202; 4241673
AB  - The zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas), is a recent invader of the Great Lakes and their connected rivers and streams. The author hypothesized that lake- stream linkages were important landscape features determining the distribution of zebra mussels. Streams surveyed in the St. Joseph River basin (Indiana- Michigan) or described in the European literature showed that zebra mussel presence in streams was associated with their presence in an upstream connected lake. Mechanisms affecting zebra mussel spread from lakes to outflowing streams were studied. Zebra mussels colonized Eagle and Christiana lakes (Michigan) in 1991 and their common outflowing stream, Christiana Creek, in 1993. Mussel densities declined exponentially from 1600/m super(2) at the outlet to <1/m super(2) at a site 4 km downstream. Studies were conducted from 1994 to 1996 to determine the cause of this dramatic decline. Physico-chemical conditions were suitable for zebra mussels in Christiana Creek. Mussel growth did not differ between Christiana Lake and sites along the stream, suggesting that food was not limiting. Although veligers were present throughout the stream, the abundance of live, mature veligers declined exponentially downstream. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that veligers were killed by hydraulic stresses (e.g., impaction on hard substrata and shear stress). Veliger mortality increased with longer exposure (i.e., distance downstream) to turbulent flow in Christiana Creek, suggesting that veliger mortality contributed to low recruitment in Christiana Creek. A manipulative experiment showed that macroinvertebrate abundance and taxa richness increased with increasing density of zebra mussels in Christiana Creek. Macroinvertebrates likely responded to the physical structure provided by the mussel shells, as no significant difference existed between live and dead mussel treatments. Lakes are sources of propagules for outflowing streams and lake-stream linkages provide zebra mussels access to large portions of drainage basins. However, colonization in streams appears to be limited to short distances below lake sources, possibly because of in-stream veliger mortality. Thus, zebra mussels may impact streams in a limited area delineated by the zone of highest abundance near the lake outlet.

T1  - Effects of a molluscicidal strain of Bacillus alvei on digestive tubules of zebra mussels, Dreissena polymorpha
AN  - 16292577; 4227639
AB  - Control of the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, invasion has been of great concern in North America. Physical or chemical control measures have numerous drawbacks and have had limited success. Microorganisms have been considered as a possible alternative means of control. Genovese and Singer (1994) found several strains of Bacillus sp. of morphological group II possessing toxic activity toward zebra mussels that might be useful for control. In the present study we examined the effect of B. alvei 2771 on adult zebra mussels.

T1  - Zebra mussels and benthic macroinvertebrate communities of southwestern Lake Ontario and selected tributaries: Unexpected results?
AN  - 16127849; 4215701
AB  - Since the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) colonized the Great Lakes ecosystem, ecologists and managers have expressed concern about potential impacts it would have on native benthic macroinvertebrate communities in lakes and streams. We compared post-Dreissena invasion data (1991-1992) with pre-invasion data (1983) from the same sites in Lake Ontario. Dreissena was the overwhelmingly dominant taxon in 1991-1992. Nevertheless, the overall abundance of other benthic macroinvertebrates, and the number of taxa collected, were greater following establishment of Dreissena. Our study failed to provide evidence that Dreissena has induced a population decline in any non-bivalve taxon that was present in 1983. The invasion of Dreissena and other recent environmental changes appear to have created conditions more favorable for most benthic macroinvertebrate taxa in the nearshore region of Lake Ontario. We also asked why zebra mussels have not colonized many creeks in western New York, some with apparently ideal habitat, that are fed partially by water from the Erie Canal which is a source of Dreissena larvae. Counts of Dreissena larvae and concentrations of chlorophyll a were much higher in the canal than in our study creek, yet water quality, current velocity, and particulate organic carbon concentrations in the creek and the canal were very similar. Four factors appear to limit colonization of creeks by the zebra mussel: 1) Retention of larvae by wetlands through which discharges from the canal often flow, 2) Filtering of phytoplankton and larvae by dense beds of adult zebra mussels often found at the beginning of channels connecting the canal to creeks, 3) Inappropriate food quality (e.g., lack of small-diameter phytoplankton with important fatty acid constituents) reaching creeks from the canal, or 4) Muddy substrates inappropriate for attachment and filter feeding by Dreissena.

T1  - International transfer of harmful marine phtoplankton in ships ballast water developments in strategies to minimise environmental and human health risks
AN  - 20367814; 7727129
AB  - Ballast water carried internationally in ships amounts to some 10 billion tonnes annually, and is now recognised as a potentially significant vector in the translocation of harmful marine phytoplankton. Although some marine organisms (including notable examples such as the dinoflagellate Gymnodinium catenatum, mollusc Dreissena polymorpha, brown seaweed, Undaria pinnatifida) have established new populations in foreign waters, incompatible local environmental conditions in many receiving ports have not been conducive to survival and subsequent establishment. Consequently, successful invasions have been limited to specific ports. Major international research efforts have been initiated to examine the extent of translocation, to investigate the factors associated with transfer and establishment, and to examine a series of management and treatment options to minimise the risks associated with ballast water discharges. An extensive set of chemical and physical treatment options has been proposed and continues to be explored with the aim of developing practical, safe, cost effective and environmentally effective options that can be considered for short and long term use. In general, chemical treatments have shown little promise, especially for some toxic phytoplankton (such as Gymnodinium catenatum and Alexandrium catenella). Some of the physical options, such as ocean exchange and heat treatment show promise for use in cases where a significant risk of establishment exists. Several basic management practices, as well as novel approaches to new ship design are also being examined. In Australia, a continuing research and demonstration program, initiated by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, and supported by shipowners and researchers is making major progress in the development of effective strategies, and demonstration of various options to minimise the risks associated with potential introductions. Strong links with international research groups and the International Maritime Organisation, as well as a public information dissemination program form part of the overall strategy. This paper will review progress at the local and international level and demonstrate that positive outcomes are beginning to emerge.

T1  - Thermal biology of the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, in North America
AN  - 16300305; 4273849
AB  - The thermal biology of the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, is critical to both nonchemical control options and an understanding of the probable geographic limits of thriving populations of this species. During winter in cold regions, water drawdown is an effective control method due to rapid mortality of mussels exposed to air 28 degree C for approximately 75 days, will cause extensive bioenergetic stress. Thus, large lakes and rivers of the southern United States do not appear to be good habitats for thriving populations of zebra mussels. It remains uncertain if physiological race formation can substantially alter warm-water tolerance.

T1  - Cost-effective method of monitoring ballast water operations: An economic study
AN  - 16300220; 4273972
AB  - Exotic species invasion poses not only ecological but also economic problems. Ballast water carried by ships is one of the ways through which these exotic species invade new, alien ecosystems. Open Water Exchange (OWE) is a mandatory requirement for ships entering the Great Lakes after trans-oceanic voyage. The National Invasive Species Act (NISA) of 1996 establishes voluntary compliance with OWE at other U.S. coastal ports also. But OWE is costly and time-consuming, and may sometimes destabilize the ship during the operation. This combined with the knowledge that ships cannot be monitored perfectly may tempt some ships to avoid OWE but report to be in compliance. The paper begins with a brief explanation of the current monitoring scheme in the Great Lakes. This is followed by our proposed improvisations to the current scheme. The model, data sources and results follow. Two case studies, the Great Lakes and Chesapeake Bay, are briefly discussed. The paper ends with conclusions. An important feature to be noted here is that the proposed mechanism can be used in monitoring voluntary compliance of ships also. The model imposes no fines per se on ships but only requires that a proportion of monitoring costs be transferred to ships in non compliance.

T1  - Comparative biology of zebra mussels in Europe and North America: An overview
AN  - 15811634; 3993296
AB  - Since the discovery of the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, in the Great Lakes in 1988 comparisons have been made with mussel populations in Europe and the former Soviet Union. These comparisons include: Population dynamics, growth and mortality rates, ecological tolerances and requirements, dispersal rates and patterns, and ecological impacts. North American studies, mostly on the zebra mussel and a few on a second introduced species, the quagga mussel, Dreissena bugensis, have revealed some similarities and some differences. To date it appears that North American populations of zebra mussels are similar to European populations in their basic biological characteristics, population growth and mortality rates, and dispersal mechanisms and rates. Relative to European populations differences have been demonstrated for: (1) individual growth rates; (2) life spans; (3) calcium and pH tolerances and requirements; (4) potential distribution limits; and (5) population densities of veligers and adults. In addition, studies on the occurrence of the two dreissenid species in the Great Lakes are showing differences in their modes of life, depth distributions, and growth rates. As both species spread throughout North America, comparisons between species and waterbodies will enhance our ability to more effectively control these troublesome species.

T1  - The physiological ecology of the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, in North America and Europe
AN  - 15809877; 3993305
AB  - The zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas), was introduced into North America in 1986. Initial North America (N.A.) studies suggested that physiological responses varied between N.A. and European populations. However, literature review indicates agreement on most aspects of physiological adaptation including: respiratory responses; hypoxia/anoxia tolerance; salinity limits; emersion tolerance; freezing resistance; environmental pH limits; calcium limits; starvation responses; and bioenergetic partitioning. The main differences among N.A. and European mussels appear to be elevated upper thermal limits and temperatures for optimum growth among N.A. populations. N.A. zebra mussels probably originated from the northern shore of the Black Sea in the warmest portion of the mussel's European range. However, most European physiological data come from northern Europe where populations may be adapted to colder temperatures. Alternatively, N.A. research suggests that mussels may have a capacity for seasonal temperature acclimatization such that responses recorded in warmer N.A. waters may be different from those recorded in northern Europe even after short-term laboratory acclimation. Studies of genetic variation and physiological response among European and N.A. D. polymorpha populations are required to elucidate the basis for physiological differentiation. Recently evolved D. polymorpha has poor resistance adaptations compared to unionacean and sphaeriid bivalves with longer freshwater fossil histories. Poor resistance adaptations make it less suited for stable habitats, instead, its high fecundities, early maturity, and rapid growth are adaptations to unstable habitats where extensive resistance adaptations are of little value.

T1  - Salinity effects on introduced dreissenid mussels
AN  - 15774127; 3985244
AB  - We tested the effects of salinity on movement, byssal attachment, and mortality of smaller (2 cm) zebra (Dreissena polymorpha) and quagga (D. bugensis) mussels acclimated to freshwater, and to 3 and 5 ppt (quagga mussels; QM) or to 4 and 6 ppt (zebra mussels; ZM). Freshwater-acclimated mussels demonstrated a decrease in movement after 48 h in salinities of 7 + ppt (ZM) and 4 + ppt (QM), a decline in byssal attachment at 5 + ppt (ZM) and 3 + ppt (QM), and increased mortality at 6 ppt (ZM) and 4 + ppt (QM). Acclimation to higher salinities at a rate of 1 ppt every 3 d raised the salinities at which movement and attachment were inhibited after 48 h for both mussel species. Zebra mussels survived exposure to 10 ppt with limited mortality (>30%); quagga mussels tolerated up to 8 ppt. Larger zebra and quagga mussels were less likely to move, attach, or survive than were smaller mussels in similar salinities. Additional experiments on the native dreissenid in Chesapeake Bay, Mytilopsis leucophaeata, found that movement, attachment, and mortality were minimally affected by salinities down to 2 ppt for individuals acclimated to 12 ppt, with limited mortality even in fresh water. Some zebra and quagga mussels spawned spontaneously in the experimental bowls during the salinity tolerance experiments. Embryos formed in salinities above about 4 ppt did not survive past the early stages of cell division, even if derived from mussels acclimated to higher salinities. Eggs spawned into fresh water by mussels acclimated to 3 to 6 ppt went unfertilized, ultimately enlarging, then disappearing. We conclude that zebra and quagga mussels can adjust to oligohaline conditions, that they could overlap with M. leucophaeata, but that spawning in the upper estuary may not produce viable embryos.

T1  - Impact of zebra mussel invasion on river water quality
AN  - 15580937; 3914318
AB  - The biology of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) is reviewed as it relates to water-quality problems in rivers. A relationship between population densities of the zebra mussel and their respiration demands for oxygen is developed, which can be used to support the analysis of the impact of zebra mussel infestation on the oxygen resources of streams and rivers. Dramatic changes in the water quality of the Seneca River, N.Y., a major tributary to Lake Ontario, have been brought about by zebra mussel infestation. These changes are documented from 3 years of monitoring data. The infestation converted the Seneca River from a turbid, phytoplankton-rich, nutrient-depleted system, with nearly saturated oxygen concentrations, to a river with high clarity, low-phytoplankton concentrations, enriched in dissolved nutrients, with greatly undersaturated oxygen concentrations. The degradation of oxygen resources was severe enough to cause violations of New York State standards for daily minimum and daily average concentrations for a number of days in the late summer of 1993. The associated loss in the waste assimilative capacity of the river is confounding waste discharge management and planning efforts in the river basin. This form of degradation is expected for other systems as the zebra mussel infestation spreads. The impact is expected to be greatest in rivers and streams with high concentrations of phytoplankton, large areas of rock substrate, and limited reaeration capacity.

T1  - Ecosystem-level effects of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha): An enclosure experiment in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron
AN  - 17063870; 3887497
AB  - We examined the short-term effects of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) on ecosystem processes in late August 1991 in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron. Four 1,600-L enclosures, made of Fabreen with a diameter of 1 m, a depth of 2 m, and closed at the bottom, were used to enclose natural plankton communities. These communities were dominated by diatoms with some chlorophytes, chrysophytes, and cyanophytes. Phytoplankton growth was limited by P-availability. Two enclosures were held as controls, and zebra mussels encrusting unionid shells were suspended in two of the enclosures: one enclosure (HZ) contained approximately four-fold greater numbers of mussels than the other (LZ). The concentration of suspended particles, chlorophyll, and algal biomass in HZ and LZ declined over a 6-day interval. Diatom numbers declined more than other taxa. Phytoplankton growth rates in HZ and LZ increased to near mu sub(max); there was no apparent change in photosynthetic parameters alpha or P sub(max) scaled for chlorophyll. Soluble reactive P (SRP) increased significantly (p < 0.05) in HZ but not LZ. Dissolved organic P (DOP) and ammonium ion were elevated; dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was unchanged in HZ and LZ. The rate of phosphate uptake by bacteria and algae declined to less than 2% of controls; this rate decrease could not be explained simply by grazing losses or isotope dilution. The rate of ammonium regeneration by the plankton and the potential rate of ammonium uptake by the plankton did not differ significantly in HZ or LZ from the control enclosures. Our findings indicate that the zebra mussel can have significant short-term effects on phytoplankton abundance, water transparency, water chemistry and phosphorus dynamics. We propose a model of zebra mussel effects that suggests high densities of zebra mussels may indirectly alter and control those processes that are rate-limited or concentration-limited by nutrient availability.

T1  - Initial colonization of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron: Population recruitment, density, and size structure
AN  - 17063662; 3887496
AB  - The various life stages of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) were examined during the initial years (1991-93) of the mussel's invasion into Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron. Yearly trends in densities of larvae, newly-settled juveniles, and adults were poorly related. Larval densities were lowest in 1991 and increased each year, but the number of settled juveniles was highest in 1991. Adults increased between 1991 and 1992 and then declined in 1993. Mean adult densities at sites with hard substrates were 11,700, 33,200, and 4,100/m super(2) in each of the 3 years, respectively. Year-to-year variation at individual sites was high and likely a result of recruitment dynamics and spatial patchiness of available substrate. By 1993, densities on hard substrates were generally similar throughout the bay, but length-frequency distributions in the inner and outer bay were quite different. The 1991-cohort was not distinguishable in the inner bay in 1993 either because of poor growth or a limited life span, but this cohort was readily distinguishable in the outer bay. In addition, ash-free dry weight of a standard 15-mm mussel in the inner bay declined 65% between 1991 and 1993. Although food concentrations (chlorophyll and particulate organic carbon) declined to low levels in 1993 and both densities and soft-tissue weight of Dreissena declined, it is not clear whether populations in the bay have peaked and are now at equilibrium with the surrounding environment.

T1  - Limits to tolerance of temperature and salinity in the quagga mussel (Dreissena bugensis) and the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha)
AN  - 17001711; 3838008
AB  - The quagga mussel (Dreissena bugensis) and the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) were exposed to varied levels of salinity and temperature in the laboratory to compare the tolerance of each species to environmental stress. The zebra mussel could tolerate 30 degree C for extended periods and higher temperatures (<39 degree C) for a period of hours depending on the acclimation temperature and the rate of temperature change. The upper thermal limit of the quagga mussel may be as low as 25 degree C. Mussels of both species acclimated to 5 degree C were less able to survive at high temperatures (30-39 degree C) than mussels acclimated to 15 or 20 degree C. The reduced upper temperature limit of the quagga mussel implies that it will not be able to expand as far south in North America as has the zebra mussel. Both D. bugensis and D. polymorpha were exposed to three concentrations of NaCl (5, 10, and 20ppt) to test salinity tolerance. No individuals of either species survived beyond 18 days in salinities of 5ppt or higher. No interspecific difference occurred in salinity-induced mortality rate.

AB  - The zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, and quagga mussel, Dreissena bugensis, newly arrived biological immigrants to North American fresh surface waters, are biofouling electric power generation, industrial, municipal and private residential water intakes, and navigation, irrigation, and water distribution canals throughout the eastern half of North America, causing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of damage and increased operating expenses. For the purposes of this paper, both species will be collectively referred to as "zebra mussels."

T1  - Non-indigenous species in the Great Lakes: Were colonization and damage to ecosystem health predictable?
AN  - 16984098; 3832925
AB  - The Great Lakes ecosystem is home to at least 139 non-indigenous species of fauna and flora which have become established following invasions or intentional introductions. About ten percent of the exotic species have caused economic or ecological damage to the system. A sample of this group is reviewed to determine if ecological concepts are useful in helping to predict colonization and impacts to ecosystem health. Successful colonization by most of the species reviewed was predictable from habitat requirements and behaviour. Ecosystem disturbance was a factor in the success of some of the colonists but was not an overriding ecological requirement. Perturbations to ecosystem health are more difficult to predict and in most cases were not readily apparent from knowledge about the ecology of invaders or native communities. The main damage to ecosystem health by the species reviewed resulted from competition, predation and habitat modification. Difficulties in predicting both invasions and damage from successful colonists point to the need to prevent non-indigenous species from reaching the Great Lakes basin.

T1  - Regional susceptibility of northeast lakes to zebra mussel invasion
AN  - 16828243; 3773194
AB  - The rapid spread of the exotic zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) concerns aquatic resource managers in the United States and Canada. Since 1990, it has been spreading from the Great Lakes into the Northeast. The zebra mussel cannot colonize equally in northeastern lakes in part because soft water causes ion exchange and reproductive problems when [Ca super(2+)] reaches a lower limit of approximately 12 mg/L, and pH drops below 7.3. We used (1) an alkalinity map to conservatively delineate areas expected to be at low risk for zebra mussel invasion and (2) water chemistry data from 344 lakes sampled in the 1991-1994 Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) to estimate numbers and surface area of lakes at risk in the Northeast (New England, New York, and New Jersey). These lakes were randomly selected from a target population of 11,080 lakes > 1 and  12 mg/L and could potentially support zebra mussel. An estimated 80% of lakes in high alkalinity areas are at risk, while only 5% of lakes in low alkalinity areas have [Ca super(2+)] > 12 mg/L. The alkalinity map adequately segregated low- and high-calcium lakes. State resource managers can use this information to better allocate control, monitoring, and education resources.

AB  - On April 29, 1992, Governor Thompson signed the budget adjustment bill (Act 269) into law. Section 9142 requires the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, in consultation with the Aquatic Nuisance Control Council, to prepare a report to the Legislature on zebra mussels by June 30, 1994. The Governor directed WDNR and the Council to examine additional staffing needs for zebra mussel activities and to develop recommendations on an appropriate funding level and potential non-general purpose revenue funding sources for consideration in the 1995-97 budget bill. Specifically the report was to identify the following key issues related to zebra mussels: The current and potential economic and environmental impacts; The potential control strategies; The geographical areas, public facilities or activities which need technical or financial assistance to reduce the environmental, public health or safety risk caused by this species; and The adequacy of existing state resources and staffing to address the problems posed by zebra mussels. This report was compiled to meet those requirements.

T1  - WALLEYE-REHABILITATION GUIDELINES FOR THE GREAT LAKES AREA
AN  - 2024771282
AB  - INTRODUCTION The decline of the percid stocks in the Great Lakes in recent decades because of anthropogenic disturbances was summarized at the Percid International Symposium (PERCIS) (Colby and Rigmore 1977) by Schneider and Leach (1977).

Since PERCIS, many of these disturbances have been reduced.

The workshop focused on the rehabilitation of walleye stocks rather than rehabilitation or development of fisheries.

[...]technology or guidelines for developing new stocks (where none existed before), or for maintaining fisheries above the level that can be sustained by natural reproduction, were beyond the scope of this workshop.

[...]rehabilitation (by our definition) can only be achieved where the population was previously depressed to low abundance as a result of manmade disturbances (overexploitation, habitat degradation, andspecies introductions).

[...]Great Lakes fish communities and edaphic conditions have undergone extensive changes since the late 1940s (Schneider and Leach 1977).

T1  - Habitat alteration caused by the keystone species Dreissena polymorpha
AN  - 16994206; 3832042
AB  - Zebra mussels invaded Lake St. Clair in 1986. By late 1990, they occurred throughout the southern and eastern areas of the lake at densities up to 20,000 m super(-2) and typically accounted for 60-90% of the macroinvertebrates. By late 1992, they occurred throughout the lake with a similar maximum density as observed previously. The structure of the aquatic habitat in the eastern basin of Lake St. Clair changed rapidly during this time interval. Water clarity doubled from a maximum of 1.5 to 4.0 m, while chlorophyll a concentrations decreased from 2-4 mu g/L to 0.4-0.8 mu g/L. The phosphorus and silt content of the sediments increased. Macrophytes, previously limited to areas along the northern and eastern shorelines with a water depth <1 m, dispersed into the eastern basin and were found in areas with depths up to 6 m. The occurrence and density of amphipods and several other macroinvertebrates also greatly increased. Removal of seston through the filtering activity of the zebra mussel population is probably the main factor responsible for the improved water clarity, reduced phytoplankton abundance, and altered composition and chemistry of the sediments. A zebra mussel population of about 5,000 m super(-2), which likely occurred in 1989, would theoretically be able to filter the entire volume of the eastern basin in under a day. These changes have consequently promoted the cascade of structural changes observed in the macrophyte and macroinvertebrate communities. These habitat changes suggest that the water quality of the lake has become more oligotrophic.

T1  - The case for research on the effects of zebra mussels in Lake Erie: Visualization of information from August and September 1993
AN  - 16842008; 3777740
AB  - Recent concern about the effects of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) has centered on potential loss of fish production and potential loss of fish edibility. The mussels are thought to cause these effects by diversion of energy flow and alteration of contaminant processing. Because management options are limited to controls on nutrients and fish harvest/stocking, it is important to determine the extent and degree of zebra mussel effects. Some effects of the mussels are obvious in sheltered shallow areas but the effects on the whole ecosystem are not known. A series of research surveys done in 1993 is reported in this paper. The effects of the mussels seem to result in a loss of about 25% of the standing algal biomass in some areas. Although an attempt was made to visit many areas of the lake, more extensive work is needed to find whole ecosystem effects. The difficulty in delineating the effects of the mussels is caused by the coincidental achievement of nutrient loading goals. Because the distribution of zebra mussels is uneven their effects may be found through extensive spatial surveys.

T1  - Zebra mussel-mediated changes in benthic algal structure and productivity in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron
AN  - 15878258; 4015273
AB  - Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron, has been the focus of research investigations into the impact of zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) invasion and proliferation on benthic algal communities. Data were collected on benthic algal biomass, carbon fixation, and resource limitation during the summers of 1991, 1992, and 1993. Filtering activity of zebra mussels was correlated with increased water clarity in Saginaw Bay. The increase in water clarity was associated with increased water column light transmission and proliferations of benthic algal biomass dominated by green filamentous members of the Zygnematales while densities of benthic diatoms declined. Rates of benthic algal primary productivity also increased following zebra mussel proliferation. In situ nutrient bioassays were conducted in the littoral zone of Saginaw Bay during the summers of 1992 and 1993 to identify factors that might limit benthic algal accrual. Nutrient-diffusing substrata were deployed to provide point sources of nitrate, phosphate, and nitrate + phosphate. In 1992 there was no significant difference in algal biomass between nutrient treatments. In 1993 benthic algal growth dominated by Spirogyra responded significantly to phosphate addition added alone or in combination with nitrate. It appears that following zebra mussel invasion the recent proliferations of benthic algae in Saginaw Bay may have shifted from light limitation to phosphorus limitation .

T1  - Bioaccumulation of PCBs by introduced caged channel catfish, zebra mussels, and semi-permeable membrane devices (SPMDs) from contaminated river sediment
AN  - 15873267; 4015314
AB  - Application of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) and SPMDs as biomonitors of environmental contaminants is becoming more widespread. Lack of data comparing these biomonitors with traditional indicators (native and introduced fish and bivalves) may be limiting their practicality. This study evaluates comparability of zebra mussels, channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) and SPMDs in situ exposure to contaminated river sediments. Mussels, catfish and SPMDs were exposed at 4 sites in the River Raisin, Monroe Harbor, MI. Zebra mussels were analyzed after 4, 10, 18, and 28 days while catfish and SPMDs were analyzed after 28 days. They were exposed to sediments that ranged from 0.4-300 ppm PCBs. Correlation was observed between levels of PCBs accumulated by these biomonitors, sediment concentrations, and exposure. In general SPMDs accumulated higher levels of total PCBs, although they were not very effective in sequestering PCBs with high log K sub(ow)'s. In most cases, zebra mussels and channel catfish bioaccumulated similar levels of total PCBs and individual congeners. Catfish did, however, lose significant amounts of lipid at all sites, and experienced high mortality at the more contaminated sites .

T1  - The areal and vertical distribution of Cladophora glomerata in western Lake Erie and its interaction with Dreissena polymorpha: A comparison of the 1980s vs. 1990s
AN  - 15680526; 3969821
AB  - Historically the distribution of the attached, filamentous green alga Cladophora glomerata in western Lake Erie has been limited by the availability of hard substrate and sufficient light for colonization. The introduction of the exotic zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) into western Lake Erie has impacted both of these limiting factors. Since both organisms require similar substrate for colonization the interaction/competition between the species is potentially great. The introduction of the filter-feeding zebra mussel has resulted in improved water clarity thus increasing light penetration and potentially expanding the vertical distribution of benthic algae. Field surveys were conducted to determine the areal and vertical distribution of Cladophora during the peak biomass period using SCUBA in the early 1980s, prior to the zebra mussel invasion. The surveys sites were revisited in 1992 and 1993 to determine if changes had occurred in the distribution of Cladophora since the introduction of zebra mussels and to investigate the interaction of Cladophora and zebra mussels on bedrock habitat. The study's primary result was that an increase in water clarity had not resulted in extending the vertical distribution of Cladophora due to competition for substrate with zebra mussels. Cladophora dominated the shallow areas from the splash zone down to approximately 1.5 m where competition for substrate began with zebra mussels. The bedrock lake bottom was generally dominated by zebra mussels at depths greater than 2 m even though adequate light levels were available for Cladophora colonization .

T1  - Approaches to the biological control of zebra mussels
AN  - 16820725; 3553065
AB  - This paper examines what role biological control techniques may play in the integrated pest management of zebra mussels, Dreissena polymorpha. Predators: Numerous organisms are known to prey on zebra mussels, but each would appear to be of little usefulness in actual control projects. Predators, however, have been reported to significantly reduce localized field populations of zebra mussels and could play an important role in the long-term reduction of zebra mussels in lakes, rivers, etc. Parasites: Very little research has been conducted on zebra mussel parasites. A recent study in the Netherlands, however, has reported a severe and apparently lethal protozoan infection. Future use of parasites as biocontrol agents can not be dismissed. In terms of environmental impact, parasites are ideal control agents since they have been fine-tuned through evolution to be host specific and thus should cause negligible nontarget problems. Parasites, however, often have complex growth requirements and elaborate life cycles; these two characteristics can represent formidable obstacles toward economical mass production-a requirement for commercialization. Toxin-Producing Microbes: A third and novel approach to developing a biological control method for zebra mussels is the screening of microorganisms (primarily bacteria) to find strains that are selectively lethal to these mussels. The microorganisms screened are not truly invasive parasites of zebra mussels, but rather microbes which are fortuitously lethal to zebra mussels when the mussels are exposed to artificially high densities of these microbes or their metabolic byproducts. Once a promising strain is found, these microbes can often be economically mass produced in vitro-a characteristic which can lead to their rapid commercialization. Such a screening process has a clear record of success in the development of microbial insecticides and may well prove valuable for zebra mussel control also. Laboratory data on lethality of bacterial stains will be presented.

T1  - Potential range of the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, in and near Virginia
AN  - 16763816; 3527689
AB  - The following document is from the proceedings of a 1993 zebra mussel workshop, conducted in Baltimore, Maryland. At the workshop, forecasts were presented concerning the future of zebra mussels, Dreissena polymorpha, in the mid-Atlantic states. This publication is devoted to predictions of the probability of invasion by the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha (and the quagga mussel, Dreissena sp.) to specific bodies of water in Virginia. Probability of invasion is divided into risk and susceptibility. Risk refers to the chance, relative to other sites, that a body of water will be inoculated with Dreissena, in sufficient number to establish a population. Inoculation can occur by natural dispersal, but in the mid-Atlantic region is most likely to occur through accidental introduction by humans, especially via boat traffic. Susceptibility of a body of water refers to the probability, based on known physiological requirements, that Dreissena could survive and reproduce. In this publication predictions are made, concerning both risk and susceptibility, for several bodies of water in Virginia.

T1  - Zebra mussel interactions with native sessile fauna
AN  - 16748420; 3721800
AB  - Ecesis interactions of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha pall. 1771) with the native benthic cobble reef community of Lake Michigan resulting in critical benthic associations over space and time, were addressed by investigating similar communities on a seawall adjacent to the Great Lakes Research Facility. The extensive cobble reef areas of Lake Michigan represent the most desirable, natural zebra mussel habitat in the lake. Ectoprocts, sponges, and attached algae are especially abundant in the cobble reef habitat (and also on the seawall study site) and actively compete with zebra mussels for the same limited substrate in Lake Michigan, namely the cobble reef areas that are extensive along the west coast. The seawall did not have any detectable mussels on it during summer, 1991. By midsummer, 1992, density had reached values of > 3500 m super(-2); during early autumn, 1992, density had reached values > 7000 m super(-2). This resulted in the exclusion of ectoprocts, sponges, and the algal community, however, sponges appeared to resist the invasion more than the other forms. In our laboratory cultures, large sponges (6 cm dia.) have grown to the exclusion of the mussels, and this scenario may prevail in nature as well, after the initial mussel population increase subsides.

T1  - Biological considerations for the control of zebra mussels
AN  - 16740466; 3722000
AB  - Biological characteristics of zebra mussels, Dreissena polymorpha, that need to be considered when developing control strategies include: (i) shell form; (ii) mode of life; (iii) reproductive potential; (iv) larval life cycle; (v) population dynamics; (vi) distribution, (vii) dispersal mechanisms; (viii) physiological requirements and tolerances; (ix) potential impact on the ecosystem; and (x) impact on society and the economy. Knowledge of its body form is important because it is not only necessary to know that the adult looks like, but how it differs from other nuisance species, especially the closely related "quagga mussel" and the brackish water, Mytilopsis leucophaeta, as well as the Asiatic clam, Corbicula fluminea. The zebra mussel is strongly byssate enabling it live on almost any hard surface but several factors, including material composition, water velocity, and temperature, affect its ability to adhere to hard surfaces. Physical and chemical characteristics of the water must be examined in order to determine the potential for infestation at a facility. Minima and maxima temperatures greatly affect the periods of reproduction and settlement, as well as the growth rates of adults. Most adults live for about 2 years but growth rates vary greatly even within the Great Lakes. Variations will be even greater in the southern United States because of higher average temperatures. Standing crops as high as 500,000 m super(-2) were reached in parts of the Great Lakes. At some sites (e.g. Lake St. Clair), population peak densities occurred about five 5 years after their introduction. High temperatures in warmer climates may not only limit population densities but the period of time needed to reach peak densities. Infestations are interfering with the normal metabolism of native unionid clams and there is potential of the unionid clam populations being reduced or even eliminated from major lakes and rivers in which zebra mussels thrive. Zebra mussels will also infest Asiatic clams which will act as a substrate for zebra mussels in many facilities. Although zebra mussels themselves will help to limit densities of Asiatic clams within facilities, control strategies must include those for Asiatic clams. The control options employed must be compatable with environmental standards for municipalities, states, and federal agencies in order to keep socioeconomic impacts to a minimum.

T1  - The Fox River as an avenue for fish dispersal
AN  - 16740359; 3721880
AB  - Dispersal of fishes and other organisms along the Fox River has been of interest for two reasons. First, concerns have been raised about the potential for exotic species to spread from Green Bay up to lower Fox River to Lake Winnebago and its tributaries. Indeed, closure of the Rapid Croche lock in 1988 has been followed by the appearance of white perch (Morone americana), sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), and zebra mussels (Driessena polymorpha), in the lower river. Second, a canal dug in the 1800's at Portage, Wisconsin, connected the upper Fox River and the Wisconsin River of the Mississippi River drainage. A number of fishes and other organisms gained access to the Great Lakes drainage through this connection. Those that have dispersed all the way to Green Bay are typical large river species, whereas species typical of smaller streams have been "sidetracked" into the Wolf River drainage. The suitability of the Fox River as a dispersal route has apparently been enhanced through improvements in water quality. Over forty fish species have been collected in recent years in a sea lamprey assessment trap set in the lower river. These include several species typically associated with habitats of high quality.

T1  - Effect of ultraviolet-B radiation (280-320 NM) on survivorship of zebra mussel larvae (Dreissena polymorpha ): A potential control strategy.
AN  - 16616734; 3037139
AB  - There is increasing evidence that naturally occurring UV-B is an important limiting ecological factor in zooplankton communities. In a natural habitat, Dreissena polymorpha larvae and other planktonic organisms could escape harmful radiation by changing their position in the water column. In a water intake pipe, however, the area is much restricted and escape from artificially-supplied ultraviolet radiation would be unlikely. The critical point in controlling zebra mussel infestation is the settling of the planktonic larvae. Prevention of settling would be the easiest and most cost-effective mechanism to remediate zebra mussel fouling problems. One possible control method, which apparently has not been tested is exposure of the larvae to ultraviolet-B radiation. Veliger larvae of the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha , were collected from Lake Erie and maintained in lake water under natural temperature (20.C) and day length (14 hr light/10 hr dark) conditions. Following acclimation, larvae were transferred to the experimental chamber and subjected to enhanced UV-B radiation. Recent experiments indicate that zebra mussel larvae are negatively affected by enhanced UV-B radiation. There is an increase in mortality above control levels after only 1 hour of exposure, which suggests that mid-range ultraviolet radiation may be effective in reducing larval populations.

T1  - The spread of the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha , in the St. Lawrence River, and its potential interactions with native benthic biota.
AN  - 16600294; 3037044
AB  - Beginning in Oct., 1989, zebra mussels, Dreissena polymorpha , were discovered attached to various substrates in and around the Snell Lock of the St. Lawrence Seaway at Massena, New York. Results suggested that the zebra mussel colony near the locks at Massena did not become established from natural dispersal downstream from Lake Ontario, but more likely from ballast being dumped into the river by a ship going through the locks. A study was designed to monitor the movement of zebra mussels into the section of the St. Lawrence River upstream from Massena, and to gather baseline data on benthic macroinvertebrates that might be affected by this invasion. Native molluscs collected included 26 snail species (Gastropoda), and numerous unionid and sphaeriid clams (Pelecypoda). Unionid clams near the Massena site were frequently covered on their posterior (siphonal) ends with zebra mussels; many heavily covered unionids were dead. Insects collected represented 9 orders and 27 families. Amphipod crustaceans were abundant, but isopods, crayfishes, sponges, bryozoans, Hydra and flatworms generally occurred in smaller numbers. The most abundant animals were cadisflies of the families Brachycentridae and Hydropsychidae. These insects require clean flowing water for feeding, and hard substrates for attachment. Because these requirements closely parallel those of D. polymorpha , strong competition may result as the latter spreads through the river. The results of such competition might have a negative impact on sport fishes that feed heavily on the insects.

T1  - Use of a riverine mesocosm to study the environmental tolerances of zebra mussels in lotic ecosystems.
AN  - 16291097; 2814062
AB  - There is a paucity of information on the biology and impact of zebra mussels in rivers. In Europe, where Dreissena is well established, the polluted condition of many lotic habitats has presumably limited riverine populations. In the United States, the zebra mussel has only recently spread from lacustrine ecosystems to rivers draining into the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean. Significant differences in environmental conditions existing in rivers versus lakes make it inadvisable to rely solely on available data from lakes when predicting impacts of zebra mussels in rivers.

T1  - Sampling Zebra Mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) in Green Bay by Displacement Volume
AN  - 1521399247; 6009497
AB  - Zebra mussels are frequently patchily distributed so the ideal sampling regime would include as many sites as possible. Measuring individual mussels has been an important feature of sampling protocols because size frequency allows for predictions of filtration rates and overall impacts of mussels on the aquatic environment. However the process of counting and measuring individual mussels is extremely time consuming, limiting the number of sites sampled in a given season. We explore an alternative sampling method in which mussel displacement volume was measured in the field. This method allowed us to sample a large number of sites in lower Green Bay and develop a map of relative zebra mussel densities within this area. To assess whether this method provides ecologically quantifiable results we used a series of lab experiments to test mussel displacement volume as a predictor of filtration rate.
