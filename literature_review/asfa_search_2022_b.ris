T1  - Protecting the Great Lakes
AN  - 2444521067
AB  - The Great Lakes are a chain of deep freshwater lakes in east-central North America, comprising Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie and Ontario. With their unique ecology and vast size, they are widely regarded as one of the Earth's great natural features. Although Lake Baikal in Russia has a larger volume of water, the combined area of the Great Lakes is over 244,000 sq. km, making them the largest surface of freshwater in the world. These gigantic basins were carved out by glaciers over thousands of years and filled by meltwater as the glaciers receded, resulting in the awe-inspiring lakes we find today. The Lakes have been hubs of industry, trade and travel for hundreds of years. Lakes Erie and Ontario and the southern portion of Lake Michigan are now surrounded by high population densities, including the cities of Chicago, Detroit and Toronto. Over 180 alien species have become established across the Great Lakes during the last 200 years, resulting in significant changes to the native ecosystem.

T1  - From uniformity to multiplicity: development of a sub-arctic Littoral Mussel Bed in the Sea of Okhotsk
AN  - 2438130155
AB  - Mussel beds are common in many intertidal and subtidal habitats, including sub-Arctic and Arctic regions. Despite their ecological importance, little is known about the demographic processes governing the development of mussel beds and particularly about the synchronization of these processes at different spatial scales. The development of a relatively compact, narrow littoral mussel bed of Mytilus trossulus, extending several hundred m along the shore of Koni Peninsula (Tauyskaya Bay, northern Sea of Okhotsk), was studied for four years during the period 2014–2017. This model bed was located along an exposed coast with a seasonal sea ice cover. It was used to test the hypothesis that small-scale synchronization exists, i.e., the changes in demographic structure of the population that occur simultaneously within a single mussel bed follow a similar pattern. This hypothesis was rejected. The size structure of the mussel population at the same tidal level changed from being uniform (2014) to being varied in 2015–2017. The course of development of the mussel population was different at the opposite ends of the bed. The cause of these differences may be unequal levels of recruitment of juveniles in the form of a gradient from one end of the bed to the other over the length of the bed. The gradient was associated with transition from one type of shore dynamic processes to another (accumulation vs. abrasion). Small-scale desynchronization may represent one of the reasons explaining the heterogeneity of mussel populations. The possibility of desynchronization of demographic processes should be taken into consideration when studying the spatial organization and dynamics of mussel beds.

T1  - From oxbow to mire: Chironomidae and Cladocera as habitat palaeoindicators
AN  - 2428803832
AB  - Chironomidae and Cladocera are useful palaeoindicators to describe long-term dynamics in biodiversity of freshwater aquatic communities. However, palaeoecological studies relying on these aquatic invertebrates have generally focused on post-glacial lakes, with relatively few applications to floodplain water bodies such as palaeo-oxbow lakes. In this study, zone-level (stratigraphic) trends in Chironomidae and Cladocera assemblage composition were analysed from a small palaeo-oxbow lake in a Central European river valley of Poland. Summer air temperature and hydrological conditions were found to be the main drivers of Cladocera and Chironomidae populations, causing a cascade effect in assemblage composition. At the local habitat scale, there were autecological differences in both taxonomic groups reflecting different responses to abiotic and biotic factors. Specifically, Cladocera responded distinctly to plant vegetation and fish predation during the Late Glacial lake phase, whereas Chironomidae were more sensitive to paludification processes and disappeared in the Northgrippian dry phase of the mire. Both groups indicated fluvial activity of the River Grabia, although the response was different. Also, species richness was higher in the more taxonomically diverse Chironomidae compared to Cladocera. As both groups responded to the same factors in a different way, it is recommended that they should be used in parallel in palaeoecological research studies.

T1  - The Different Biomarkers in the Assessment of the Marine Environmental Quality Using the Representative Species <i>Mytilus trossulus</i>
AN  - 2426701211
AB  - The mussel Mytilus trossulus was used to assess the relationship between the reactions of biomarkers and the degree of environmental pollution, as well as their potential use in biomonitoring. Metal bioaccumulation and a battery of biomarkers were measured in the mussels from the Zolotoy Rog Bay and Vostok Bay (Peter the Great Bay, the Sea of Japan) that display substantial differences in the levels of pollution. The biomarkers included lysosomal membrane stability (LMS); condition indices (CI and CIL); the activities of catalase (CAT), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE); and the levels of lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, TBARS), protein oxidation (protein carbonyls, PC), and DNA damage. At the molecular level for M. trossulus, the biomarkers of oxidative stress (CAT, TBARS, and PC) and AChE do not show a known degree of environmental pollution. At the same time, the biomarkers LMS and condition indices, as well as the biomarkers GST and DNA damage, are sensitive to complex chronic environmental pollution.

T1  - Regulating Vessel Biofouling to Support New Zealand’s Marine Biosecurity System – A Blue Print for Evidence-Based Decision Making
AN  - 2414907989
AB  - A healthy marine environment is integral to many of New Zealand’s economic, social and cultural values, which include fisheries, aquaculture, tourism, and recreational and customary activities. The introduction and spread of marine non-indigenous species (NIS) via the vessel biofouling pathway may put these values at risk. Over the past two decades, the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) has been proactive in commissioning research focused on the risks associated with vessel biofouling, identification of potential risk vessels, and risk management options. In 2010, MPI consulted on options to manage the biofouling risks on all vessels entering New Zealand waters. In 2014, New Zealand became the first country to introduce mandatory biofouling requirements. Between 2014 and 2018, MPI focused on communicating the requirements to support stakeholder awareness, readiness and uptake. In parallel, MPI commissioned further research to investigate proactive and reactive approaches to biofouling management. Research outcomes were summarized and technical advice provided to inform stakeholders of what constitutes best biofouling management practices. This review summarizes MPI’s research and technical advice on the risks associated with vessel biofouling and its management, and the procedures followed to produce New Zealand’s biofouling regulations. The development of these regulations is also contextualized in terms of New Zealand’s marine biosecurity system. The transparent and evidence-based approach followed by MPI provides a blueprint for establishing biofouling regulations. Because these regulations are based on International Maritime Organization guidelines, there is the potential to develop consistent global and domestic practices for managing marine NIS introduction and spread.

T1  - Invasive Species and Amphibian Conservation
AN  - 2438197488
AB  - The recognition that invasive alien species (IAS) are among the greatest threats to biodiversity has stimulated a growing interest in their impacts on native amphibians. Here we describe the multifaceted consequences of biological invasions on native amphibians and identify potential mechanisms and strategies that could better enable the long-term persistence of native species. IAS can influence amphibian fitness, population size, and community structure via multiple pathways and can exert major, direct impacts through predation, competition, and hybridization. The consequences of indirect impacts, too, such as habitat alteration and the spread of emerging diseases, can be particularly severe in native populations. Native amphibians may respond to IAS by modulating aspects of their behavior, morphology, or life history. Nevertheless, it is still unclear the extent to which phenotypic plasticity and rapid evolution may help native species withstand the impacts of IAS in invaded communities. Practical management strategies focused on prevention, monitoring, and early control are the most effective approaches to allay the impacts of IAS and should be prioritized in proactive conservation plans. Eradications of IAS and mitigation approaches, should IAS become established, are feasible and can greatly improve the status of native populations.

T1  - Endocrine disruption and altered sexual development in aquatic organisms: an invertebrate perspective
AN  - 2426391261
AB  - Contaminants causing sex-altering, endocrine disrupting-like (ED) effects, or otherwise influencing reproduction, have been of growing concern to humans for more than 50 years. They have also been a perturbing, though less well-studied, phenomenon in marine organisms, following the recognition of tributyltin (TBT)-induced imposex and population extinctions in (neo)gastropods in the 1970s. Whilst ED impacts in mammals and fish are characterized by mimicry or antagonism of endogenous hormones by environmental contaminants (acting through Nuclear Receptors which are present in all metazoans) much less is known regarding pathways to effects in invertebrates. Despite the absence of a defined steroidal/mechanistic component, the extent, severity and widespread nature of ED-like manifestations and altered sexual characteristics observed in marine invertebrates gives rise to comparable concerns, and have been a long-term component of the MBA's research remit. The manifestations seen in sensitive taxa such as molluscs and crustaceans confirm they are valuable indicators of environmental quality, and should be exploited in this capacity whilst we seek to understand the pervasiveness and underlying mechanisms. In so doing, invertebrate indicators address aims of organizations, such as the EEA, OECD, UNEP and WHO, charged with management and monitoring of chemicals and ensuring that adverse effects on humans and the environment are minimized (Bergman et al., 2013). In view of the recent general declines in marine biodiversity, and the potential contribution of ED-like phenomena, safeguarding against deleterious effects through increased research which links pollutant exposure with reproductive dysfunction among invertebrates, is seen as a high priority.

T1  - Framing the concept of invasive species “impact” within a management context
AN  - 2411621615
AB  - Governments and conservation organizations worldwide are motivated to manage invasive species due to quantified and perceived negative ecological and economic impacts invasive species impose. Thus, determining which species cause significant negative impacts, as well as clear articulation of those impacts, is critical to meet conservation priorities. This process of determining which species warrant management can be straightforward when there are clear negative impacts, such as dramatic reductions in native diversity. However, the majority of changes to ecosystem pools and fluxes cannot be readily categorized as ecologically negative or positive (e.g., lower soil pH). Additionally, diverse stakeholders may not all agree on impacts as negative. This complexity challenges our ability to simply and uniformly determine which species cause negative impact, and thus which species merit management, especially as we expand invader impacts to encompass a more holistic ecosystem perspective beyond biodiversity and consider stakeholder perspectives and priorities. Thus, we suggest impact be evaluated in a context that is dictated by governing policies or conservation/land management missions with the support of scientists. In other words, within each jurisdiction, populations are identified as causing negative impact based on the hierarchical governing policies and mission of that parcel. Framing negative impact in a management context has the advantages of (1) easily scaling from individual landscapes to geopolitical states; (2) better representing how managers practice, (3) reflecting invasive species as spatially contextual, not universal, and (4) allowing for flexibility with dynamic ecosystems undergoing global change. We hope that framing negative impact in an applied context aids management prioritization and achieving conservation goals.

T1  - Integrated early warning systems in marine bivalves reveal detrimental alterations of coastal habitats
AN  - 2404249610
AB  - Several biological levels are considered as signals of environmental perturbations so that integrative biological responses have been proposed in environmental monitoring activities. We evaluated the use of markers in Mytilus galloprovincialis at two different levels (protein nitration and S-nitrosylation, and geometric morphometrics) to investigate the sea coastal environmental status. We studied adductor muscle, digestive gland and valves of mussels collected from 3 sampling sites (2 disturbed + 1 control) in eastern Tyrrhenian Sea, and 2 (1 + 1) in western Ionian Sea. Molecular and morphometric markers showed significant variations in relation to environmental conditions, but the most interesting result was evidenced by the analysis of covariation between both protein post-translational modifications and geometric morphometric descriptors. The main interesting finding regards the relationship between protein nitration values (an irreversible molecular marker) of both adductor muscle and digestive gland, and geometric morphometric descriptors (that are Procrustes’ distances) of valve shapes. Molecular and morphometric markers revealed useful warning systems in detecting environmental changes, even if causes and mechanisms altering both cellular metabolism and shape morphology are still unclear. Our findings suggested that pollutants affected the normal cellular metabolic pathways altering the correct functionality at higher biological levels and producing developmental detrimental noise visible on the shell.

T1  - Genetic and functional repertoires of <i>Limnoperna fortunei</i> (Dunker, 1857) (Mollusca, Mytilidae): a review on the use of molecular techniques for the detection and control of the golden mussel
AN  - 2400896385
AB  - Limnoperna fortunei, the golden mussel, is a bivalve mollusc native to Southeast Asia, which was introduced to South America via ballast water from commercial cargo ships from China and South Korea. In Brazil, the golden mussel is considered an invasive species, which has caused enormous economic and environmental damage. This is mainly due to the obstruction of pipes carrying water for the cooling systems within hydroelectric power plants. The presence of this invasive species also negatively impacts native fauna and flora. Early detection and rapid response during the early stages of infestation for this invasive species is essential to effectively control populations and prevent new infestations from forming. Techniques within molecular biology allow for more efficient detection of the golden mussel in all stages of development. In addition, the analysis of the genome, transcriptome and proteome of this species makes it possible to identify targets of biotechnological interest, which may be useful for the control of the golden mussel or for the generation of products of technological innovation. This review presents an overview of molecular studies involving this species and the perspectives on the prevention, control and combat of the golden mussel using these approaches.

T1  - Applications of environmental DNA (eDNA) in ecology and conservation: opportunities, challenges and prospects
AN  - 2396574298
AB  - Conserving biodiversity in the face of ever-increasing human pressure is hampered by our lack of basic information on species occurrence, distribution, abundance, habitat requirements, and threats. Obtaining this information requires efficient and sensitive methods capable of detecting and quantifying true occurrence and diversity, including rare, cryptic and elusive species. Environmental DNA (eDNA) is an emerging technique that can increase our ability to detect and quantify biodiversity, by overcoming some of the challenges of labor-intensive traditional surveys. The application of eDNA in ecology and conservation has grown enormously in recent years, but without a concurrent growth in appreciation of its strengths and limitations. In many situations, eDNA may either not work, or it may work but not provide the information needed. Problems with (1) imperfect detection, (2) abundance quantification, (3) taxonomic assignment, (4) eDNA spatial and temporal dynamics, (5) data analysis and interpretation, and (6) assessing ecological status have all been significant. The technique has often been used without a careful evaluation of the technical challenges and complexities involved, and a determination made that eDNA is the appropriate method for the species or environment of interest. It is therefore important to evaluate the scope and relevance of eDNA-based studies, and to identify critical considerations that need to be taken into account before using the approach. We review and synthesize eDNA studies published to date to highlight the opportunities and limitations of utilizing eDNA in ecology and conservation. We identify potential ways of reducing limitations in eDNA analysis, and demonstrate how eDNA and traditional surveys can complement each other.

T1  - Resilience of aquatic systems: Review and management implications
AN  - 2383878277
AB  - Our understanding of how ecosystems function has changed from an equilibria-based view to one that recognizes the dynamic, fluctuating, nonlinear nature of aquatic systems. This current understanding requires that we manage systems for resilience. In this review, we examine how resilience has been defined, measured and applied in aquatic systems, and more broadly, in the socioecological systems in which they are embedded. Our review reveals the importance of managing stressors adversely impacting aquatic system resilience, as well as understanding the environmental and climatic cycles and changes impacting aquatic resources. Aquatic resilience may be enhanced by maintaining and enhancing habitat connectivity as well as functional redundancy and physical and biological diversity. Resilience in aquatic socioecological system may be enhanced by understanding and fostering linkages between the social and ecological subsystems, promoting equity among stakeholders, and understanding how the system is impacted by factors within and outside the area of immediate interest. Management for resilience requires implementation of adaptive and preferably collaborative management. Implementation of adaptive management for resilience will require an effective monitoring framework to detect key changes in the coupled socioecological system. Research is needed to (1) develop sensitive indicators and monitoring designs, (2) disentangle complex multi-scalar interactions and feedbacks, and (3) generalize lessons learned across aquatic ecosystems and apply them in new contexts.

T1  - Gridlock and beltways: the genetic context of urban invasions
AN  - 2371561443
AB  - The rapid expansion of urban land across the globe presents new and numerous opportunities for invasive species to spread and flourish. Ecologists historically rejected urban ecosystems as important environments for ecology and evolution research but are beginning to recognize the importance of these systems in shaping the biology of invasion. Urbanization can aid the introduction, establishment, and spread of invaders, and these processes have substantial consequences on native species and ecosystems. Therefore, it is valuable to understand how urban areas influence populations at all stages in the invasion process. Population genetic tools are essential to explore the driving forces of invasive species dispersal, connectivity, and adaptation within cities. In this review, we synthesize current research about the influence of urban landscapes on invasion genetics dynamics. We conclude that urban areas are not only points of entry for many invasive species, they also facilitate population establishment, are pools for genetic diversity, and provide corridors for further spread both within and out of cities. We recommend the continued use of genetic studies to inform invasive species management and to understand the underlying ecological and evolutionary processes governing successful invasion.

T1  - Resource competition among the Anostraca <i>Dendrocephalus brasiliensis</i> and three Neotropical cladocerans: implications on population dynamics and secondary production
AN  - 2356819055
AB  - Invasive species may affect the equilibrium of natural communities, competing for resources and occupying niches of the native biota. Dendrocephalus brasiliensis (DEN) has potential to aquaculture, although its use is concerning, since DEN is allochthone in some regions of Brazil. Here, we aimed to study the possible effects of DEN on three cladocerans Moina micrura (MOI), Macrothrix flabelligera (MAC) and Daphnia laevis (DAPH). We performed microcosm experiments combining different cladoceran species in mono- and polycultures in the presence and absence of DEN by evaluating density, biomass, production, stages of development and turnover. MOI was competitive excluded when in 2-species polycultures with MAC and DAPH, and in 4-species polycultures with MAC, DAPH and DEN together. Since MOI survived when cultured with MAC and DAPH in 3-species polycultures, DEN possibly played a role on MOI suppression. Regarding density, DAPH had a slightly suppression when exposed separately with MOI, although MAC had higher production in the presence of MOI. Development stages with similar body size apparently competed more intensely for resources. Our results indicate that DEN has potential to invade ecosystems, destabilizing native zooplankton communities, since it affected MAC and DAPH, thus altering their competitive advantage, besides contributing to MOI exclusion.

T1  - Invasive <i>Potamopyrgus antipodarum</i> (New Zealand mud snails) and native snails differ in sensitivity to specific electrical conductivity and cations
AN  - 2352272836
AB  - When species are introduced to novel environments, abiotic conditions must be suitable for species to become invasive. For example, water chemistry must be acceptable for aquatic non-natives to colonize and persist. In two laboratory experiments, we measured growth and survival of Potamopyrgus antipodarum, a worldwide invasive snail from New Zealand, and two co-occurring native snails [Pyrgulopsis robusta and Galba (Bakerilymnaea) bulimoides group] to contrast the relative sensitivity of the three species to aspects of water chemistry (specific conductivity and concentration of multiple cations). Low conductivity reduced growth and survival of Potamopyrgus but did not affect growth of native snails and only reduced survival of one native species, Pyrgulopsis, at extremely low conductivity. In contrast, neither specific cations nor concentration affected growth and survival of Potamopyrgus, but both affected native snails; Pyrgulopsis, grew more at higher concentrations of cations, and Galba grew nine times faster with added potassium than with added magnesium and had higher survival in concentrated than in diluted solutions. Thus, the invasive and native snails differed in their sensitivity to water chemistry: the invasive snail is more sensitive to conductivity, and the native snails are more sensitive to the concentration of specific cations. Our conclusions are consistent with previous studies and with the distribution of Potamopyrgus in the western USA, and parts of Europe, where density of the invasive snail increases with conductivity. Thus, native snails may be able to escape negative effects of the invasive snails by inhabiting areas with low conductivity, when ion concentrations are sufficient.

T1  - Phenotypic plasticity at fine-grained spatial scales: the scorched mussel Perumytilus purpuratus growing on Patagonian rocky salt-marshes
AN  - 2536845309
AB  - Understanding phenotypic plasticity of species at different spatial scales is vital in the current context of an increasing pace of environmental changes. Through this knowledge, it is possible to predict their potential to adapt and/or evolve in face of new environmental conditions such as climate change, and/or to understand their ecological range expansion. In Patagonian rocky salt-marshes, one of the most abundant invertebrate species is the scorched mussel Perumytilus purpuratus. In this system, this mussel can be found inhabiting both vegetated and non-vegetated patches, which differ in critical environmental conditions. We performed a field study evaluating whether mussels growing in vegetated patches differ in shell shape from those growing in adjacent non-vegetated patches. We sampled individuals from both patch types and assessed their shell shape and size using geometric morphometrics. The results showed that mussels from vegetated patches had shells that were more dorsoventrally expanded, anterodorsally restricted and globose in shape than those from non-vegetated patches, which showed the opposite traits resulting in a more elongated shell. The differences found could be driven by the different conditions of temperature, desiccation rate, wave action and population density to which mussels are exposed in each patch type. These results revealed the striking phenotypic plasticity of shell form of this native species at a fine-grained scale, which could be one of the explanations for its success in its ecological range expansion.Alternate abstract: 
Poder comprender la plasticidad fenotípica de las especies, a diferentes escalas espaciales, es fundamental en un contexto de crecientes cambios ambientales. A través de este conocimiento, es posible predecir su potencial para adaptarse y/o evolucionar frente a nuevas condiciones ambientales tales como el cambio climático, y/o entender el modo en el que se expanden o expandieron sus rangos ecológicos. En las marismas rocosas patagónicas, una de las especies de invertebrados marinos más abundantes es el mejillín Perumytilus purpuratus. En este sistema, se lo encuentra en parches vegetados y sin vegetación que difieren en condiciones ambientales críticas. Mediante un estudio a campo, evaluamos si los mejillines que crecen en parches vegetados difieren en la forma de la concha de aquéllos que crecen en parches adyacentes sin vegetación. Para ello, se colectaron individuos de ambos tipos de parches y se evaluó la forma y el tamaño de las valvas utilizando morfometría geométrica. Los resultados mostraron que los mejillines de parches con vegetación presentan conchas más expandidas dorsoventralmente, con restricción anterodorsal, generando una forma globosa en comparación con la de los individuos de parches sin vegetación. Las distintas formas encontradas podrían deberse a las diferentes condiciones de temperatura, desecación, acción de las olas y densidad poblacional a las que están expuestos los mejillines en cada tipo de parche. Estos resultados muestran la presencia de plasticidad fenotípica en la forma de las valvas de esta especie nativa a una microescala espacial, lo que explicaría el éxito de esta especie en su expansión hacia nuevos ambientes.

T1  - Diversity of Alien Macroinvertebrate Species in Serbian Waters
AN  - 2471234962
AB  - This article provides the first comprehensive list of alien macroinvertebrate species registered and/or established in aquatic ecosystems in Serbia as a potential threat to native biodiversity. The list comprised field investigations, articles, grey literature, and unpublished data. Twenty-nine species of macroinvertebrates have been recorded since 1942, with a domination of the Ponto-Caspian faunistic elements. The majority of recorded species have broad distribution and are naturalized in the waters of Serbia, while occasional or single findings of seven taxa indicate that these species have failed to form populations. Presented results clearly show that the Danube is the main corridor for the introduction and spread of non-native species into Serbia.

T1  - Carbon Fixation Trends in Eleven of the World’s Largest Lakes: 2003–2018
AN  - 2470563676
AB  - Large freshwater lakes provide immense value to the surrounding populations, yet there is limited understanding of how these lakes will respond to climate change and other factors. This study uses satellite remote sensing to estimate annual, lake-wide primary production in 11 of the world’s largest lakes from 2003–2018. These lakes include the five Laurentian Great Lakes, the three African Great Lakes, Lake Baikal, and Great Bear and Great Slave Lakes. Mean annual production in these lakes ranged from under 200 mgC/m2/day to over 1100 mgC/m2/day, and the lakes were placed into one of three distinct groups (oligotrophic, mesotrophic, or eutrophic) based on their level of production. The analysis revealed only three lakes with significant production trends over the study period, with increases in Great Bear Lake (24% increase over the study period) and Great Slave Lake (27%) and a decline in Lake Tanganyika (−16%). These changes appear to be related to climate change, including increasing temperatures and solar radiation and decreasing wind speeds. This study is the first to use consistent methodology to study primary production in the world’s largest lakes, allowing for these novel between-lake comparisons and assessment of inter-annual trends.

T1  - Using Freshwater Bivalves (Corbicula Fluminea) to Alleviate Harmful Effects of Small-Sized Crucian Carp (Carassius Carassius) on Growth of Submerged Macrophytes during Lake Restoration by Biomanipulation
AN  - 2460953995
AB  - Increased recruitment of small-sized fish following biomanipulation by reducing the biomass of plankti-benthivorous fish, not least in (sub)tropical lakes, may deteriorate water quality and thereby potentially hamper the recovery of submerged macrophytes. Filter-feeding bivalves remove suspended particles from the water and may, thereby, somewhat or fully counteract this negative effect of the increasing abundance of small-sized fish. So far, only few studies have investigated the interactive effects of fish and bivalves on water clarity and macrophyte growth. We conducted a 2 × 2 factorial designed outdoor mesocosm experiment with two densities of small crucian carp Carassius carassius (low 10 g m−2 and high 40 g m−2) and two densities of bivalves Corbicula fluminea (low 204 g m−2 and high 816 g m−2). We found significant interactive effect of fish and bivalves on the growth of the macrophyte Vallisneria natans. In the low density bivalve regime, the relative growth rates, root mass, root:shoot ratio and number of tubers were 30.3%, 30.8%, 21.6% and 27.8% lower in the high than in the low density fish treatments, while the decrease was less pronounced in the high density bivalve regime: 1.2%, 8.7%, 2.1% and 13.3%, respectively. Thus, bivalves reduced the negative effects of fish, not least when bivalve density was high. The weaker effects of small fish on plants in the high- than in the low-density C. fluminea regime can be attributed to lower total suspended solids (TSS) and Chl a in the first week of the experiment. Better light conditions further stimulated the growth of benthic algae, potentially increasing the removal of nutrients from the water and reducing fish-driven resuspension of the sediment. In addition, high densities of C. fluminea also enriched the sediment total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) content, favouring plant growth as indicated by an increase in leaf tissue TN and TP contents. Our results demonstrate that filter-feeding bivalves can alleviate harmful effects of small fish by prolonging a clear-water state that facilitates submerged macrophyte growth. Addition of the bivalve C. fluminea can be a promising tool for the restoration of submerged macrophytes in shallow eutrophic lakes, in particular lakes containing small, rapidly reproducing fish that due to their small sizes are not capable of controlling the bivalves.

T1  - Review of Methods to Repair and Maintain Lithophilic Fish Spawning Habitat
AN  - 2441933301
AB  - Rocky reefs provide important spawning and refuge habitats for lithophilic spawning fishes. However, many reefs have been lost or severely degraded through anthropogenic effects like dredging, channelization, or sedimentation. Constructed reefs have been used to mitigate these effects in some systems, but these reefs are also subject to degradation which may warrant custodial maintenance. Monitoring and maintenance of natural or constructed spawning reefs are not common practices; therefore, few methodologies have been created to test the effectiveness of such tools. We conducted a literature review to assess available information on maintenance of rocky spawning habitats used by lithophilic fishes. We identified 54 rocky spawning habitat maintenance projects, most of which aimed to improve fish spawning habitats through the addition of spawning substrate (n = 33) or cleaning of substrate (n = 23). In comparison to shallow riverine studies focused on salmonids, we found little information on deep-water reefs, marine reefs, or other fish species. We discuss the possible application of potential spawning habitat cleaning methods from other disciplines (e.g., treasure hunting; archeology) that may provide effective means of reef maintenance that can be used by restoration practitioners.

T1  - Two Ocean Pass: An Alternative Hypothesis for the Invasion of Yellowstone Lake by Lake Trout, and Implications for Future Invasions
AN  - 2411447975
AB  - Preventing the interbasin transfer of aquatic invasive species is a high priority for natural resource managers. Such transfers can be made by humans or can occur by dispersal through connected waterways. A natural surface water connection between the Atlantic and Pacific drainages in North America exists at Two Ocean Pass south of Yellowstone National Park. Yellowstone cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri used this route to cross the Continental Divide and colonize the Yellowstone River from ancestral sources in the Snake River following glacial recession 14,000 bp. Nonnative lake trout Salvelinus namaycush were stocked into lakes in the Snake River headwaters in 1890 and quickly dispersed downstream. Lake trout were discovered in Yellowstone Lake in 1994 and were assumed to have been illegally introduced. Recently, lake trout have demonstrated their ability to move widely through river systems and invade headwater lakes in Glacier National Park. Our objective was to determine if lake trout and other nonnative fish were present in the connected waters near Two Ocean Pass and could thereby colonize the Yellowstone River basin in the past or future. We used environmental DNA (eDNA), electrofishing, and angling to survey for lake trout and other fishes. Yellowstone cutthroat trout were detected at nearly all sites on both sides of the Continental Divide. Lake trout and invasive brook trout S. fontinalis were detected in Pacific Creek near its confluence with the Snake River. We conclude that invasive movements by lake trout from the Snake River over Two Ocean Pass may have resulted in their colonization of Yellowstone Lake. Moreover, Yellowstone Lake may be vulnerable to additional invasions because several other nonnative fish inhabit the upper Snake River. In the future, eDNA collected across smaller spatial intervals in Pacific Creek during flow conditions more conducive to lake trout movement may provide further insight into the extent of non-native fish invasions in this stream.

T1  - Springs and Springs-Dependent Taxa of the Colorado River Basin, Southwestern North America: Geography, Ecology and Human Impacts
AN  - 2407509709
AB  - The Colorado River basin (CRB), the primary water source for southwestern North America, is divided into the 283,384 km2, water-exporting Upper CRB (UCRB) in the Colorado Plateau geologic province, and the 344,440 km2, water-receiving Lower CRB (LCRB) in the Basin and Range geologic province. Long-regarded as a snowmelt-fed river system, approximately half of the river’s baseflow is derived from groundwater, much of it through springs. CRB springs are important for biota, culture, and the economy, but are highly threatened by a wide array of anthropogenic factors. We used existing literature, available databases, and field data to synthesize information on the distribution, ecohydrology, biodiversity, status, and potential socio-economic impacts of 20,872 reported CRB springs in relation to permanent stream distribution, human population growth, and climate change. CRB springs are patchily distributed, with highest density in montane and cliff-dominated landscapes. Mapping data quality is highly variable and many springs remain undocumented. Most CRB springs-influenced habitats are small, with a highly variable mean area of 2200 m2, generating an estimated total springs habitat area of 45.4 km2 (0.007% of the total CRB land area). Median discharge also is generally low and variable (0.10 L/s, N = 1687, 95% CI = 0.04 L/s), but ranges up to 1800 L/s. Water pH and conductivity is negatively related to elevation, with a stronger negative relationship in the UCRB compared to the LCRB. Natural springs water temperature and geochemistry throughout the CRB varies greatly among springs, but relatively little within springs, and depends on aquifer hydrogeology, elevation, and residence time. As the only state nearly entirely included within the CRB, Arizona is about equally divided between the two geologic provinces. Arizona springs produce approximately 0.6 km3/year of water. Data on >330 CRB springs-dependent taxa (SDT) revealed at least 62 plant species; 216 aquatic and riparian Mollusca, Hemiptera, Coleoptera, and other invertebrate taxa; several herpetofanual species; and two-thirds of 35 CRB fish taxa. Springs vegetation structure, composition, and diversity vary strongly by springs type, and plant species density within springs is high in comparison with upland habitats. Plant species richness and density is negatively related to elevation below 2500 m. Human population in and adjacent to the CRB are growing rapidly, and ecological impairment of springs exceeds 70% in many landscapes, particularly in urbanized and rangeland areas. Anthropogenic stressors are primarily related to groundwater depletion and pollution, livestock management, flow abstraction, non-native species introduction, and recreation. Ensuring the ecological integrity and sustainability of CRB groundwater supplies and springs will require more thorough basic inventory, assessment, research, information management, and local ecosystem rehabilitation, as well as improved groundwater and springs conservation policy.

T1  - Effects of a retaining wall and an artificial embankment on nearshore littoral habitats and biota in a large Alpine lake
AN  - 2328246025
AB  - The littoral zones of many Central European lakes are severely altered by lake-side retaining walls. These are suspected to impair littoral biota due to the reflection of incoming wave energy. We conducted a comparative study (armoured shore with a retaining wall and a restored shore with a wedge-shaped cobble embankment vs. a pristine shore) at a wind-exposed shore section of Lake Constance. The retaining wall had a number of significant remote effects on the littoral zone, i.e. increased near-bottom current velocities, higher bed-load transport rates, coarsening of surface sediments, reduction in phytomass density, reduction in total densities and number of taxa of macroinvertebrates as well as a significant decline in the percentages of Limnomysis benedeni Czerniavsky, 1882, Ostracoda, Corbicula fluminea O.F. Müller, 1774, Dreissenapolymorpha (Pallas, 1771) and other Bivalvia. However, the significantly affected zone had a rather narrow width of ~ 3 m. Shore restoration measures are needed to remediate negative effects of retaining walls and re-establish ecological conditions that are comparable to those of pristine shores. We recommend a more site sensitive sampling strategy, e.g. for macroinvertebrates in context with the ecological quality assessment under the European Water Framework Directive.

T1  - Zooplankton invasions in the early 21st century: a global survey of recent studies and recommendations for future research
AN  - 2325191670
AB  - We present a comprehensive survey of the scientific literature pertaining to non-indigenous and invasive zooplankton published across the first decades of the twenty-first century (i.e., 2000–2018). We provide a concise summary of the manner in which the scientific community has allocated its efforts to this issue in recent decades, and to illuminate trends that emerge from the literature. Our search yielded 620 publications encompassing 139 invasive zooplankton species, with invasive zooplankton reported from every region of the planet—including the Arctic and Antarctic. Most taxa were reported in a small number of publications, with the majority being mentioned in only a single paper. In contrast, approximately half of the surveyed publications concerned just four species: Bythotrephes longimanus, Mnemioposis leidyi, Cercopagis pengoi, and Daphnia lumholtzi. Our survey reveals strong geographic patterns among the literature, with most publications arising from economically developed western nations. We found that the majority of publications pertained to holoplanktonic organisms from freshwater habitats, especially from the North American Great Lakes. Based on these results, we present several recommendations for future research topics that may hold considerable opportunity for growth in our understanding of the invasion process.

T1  - Effects of Corbicula fluminea on the nutrient concentration and phytoplankton biomass of tropical reservoirs
AN  - 2623487927
AB  - Invasive bivalves are known to negatively impact aquatic ecosystems across the globe. Previous research has demonstrated invasive bivalves can shift nutrients from the water column to the sediment, harm native bivalves, and reduce phytoplankton biomass. However, bivalve effects vary with species and the region where the invasion occurs. Therefore, we used mesocosm experiments to examine the impact of invasive Corbicula fluminea on nutrient concentration and phytoplankton biomass in the water column of mesotrophic and eutrophic Puerto Rican reservoirs. We used four treatments to determine the effect of C. fluminea on the water column. We found C. fluminea did not have a significant effect on the ammonium, nitrate, or phosphorus concentration in either the mesotrophic or eutrophic mesocosm experiments. Additionally, C. fluminea presence did not significantly alter phytoplankton biomass, though Synedra dominated the phytoplankton community when C. fluminea were absent. While C. fluminea may not have caused an effect in the water column as it was potentially phytoplankton limited, the mesocosm experiment conditions reflect the natural environment, indicating phytoplankton limitation could be an issue in the reservoirs. Our findings suggest C. fluminea does not have a large effect on nutrient concentration or phytoplankton biomass in eutrophic and mesotrophic Puerto Rican reservoirs. This study represents the first effort to examine the effects of C. fluminea presence on the water column of a tropical reservoir.

T1  - Using functional traits to assess the influence of burrowing bivalves on nitrogen-removal in streams
AN  - 2320975216
AB  - Functional traits define an organism in terms of how the organism interacts with its environment and determine the influence the organism has on dynamic ecosystem processes, such as biogeochemical nutrient cycling. Freshwater mussels (Bivalvia: Unionidae) form hotspots of biogeochemical activity in benthic environments by alleviating nutrient limitation at the sediment–water interface; however, little is known about the influence of mussel functional traits on sediment biogeochemical cycles, particularly nitrogen (N)-removal via denitrification and anammox. Our aim was to model the influence of two mussel functional traits: ammonium (NH4+) excretion and organic matter (OM) biodeposition, on N-removal in stream sediments. We quantified mussel excretion and biodeposition and incubated mussels in microcosms containing river sediment using flow-through methods. We measured nutrient and gas fluxes to quantify real-time ambient N-removal (denitrification + anammox), and conducted isotope pairing techniques to determine the maximum N-removal potential for denitrification and anammox pathways. NH4+ excretion was shown to be a significant predictor of ambient N-removal, whereas OM biodeposition significantly increased the maximum N-removal potential in the sediment. Our study is the first of its kind to link mussel functional traits specifically to N-removal and contributes to the growing knowledge of the role these highly imperiled organisms play by directly and indirectly influencing ecosystem-scale processes in lotic systems.

T1  - A conceptual framework for the identification and characterization of lacustrine spawning habitats for native lake charr <i>Salvelinus namaycush</i>
AN  - 2320880104
AB  - Lake charr Salvelinus namaycush are endemic to the formerly glaciated regions of North America and spawn primarily in lakes, unlike most other Salmoninae. Spawning habitats for lake charr are thought to be characterized by relatively large substrate particle sizes which provide sufficient interstitial spaces for egg incubation, but little is known about the physical processes that create or maintain suitable habitats. We review the literature on lake charr spawning habitat and present a conceptual framework that examines the roles of physical variables in creating the appropriate conditions for egg incubation. A critical underlying assumption of this framework is that lake charr will select spawning habitats that provide suitable hypolentic flows for egg incubation. We suggest that the characterization of lakebed surface roughness, current patterns, substrate particle size, and groundwater flows at multiple spatial scales may yield significant insight into the physical mechanisms supporting lacustrine spawning habitats for lake charr and will be useful in creating predictive models of these habitats. This framework may also apply to other lake-spawning lithophilic fish species.

T1  - Experimental investigation of turbulent flow over live mussels
AN  - 2170085849
AB  - Unionids have been described as ecosystem engineers capable of affecting the local food web as well as the hydrodynamics, passively and actively. In this study, we perform particle image velocimetry measurements to characterize the flow around a live Amblema plicata using natural sediments as tracer particles under two specific flow rates and orientations i.e., facing upstream and downstream, to understand the interaction between the organism and flow surrounding it. The behavior of the mussel is also quantified under all the above experimental conditions using a hall-effect gape sensor that captures valve motion. The flow measurements show clear variations between the two orientations tested, with the presence of a low velocity region behind the mussel extending beyond the tested field of view for the upstream orientation. In contrast, the flow in the wake of the downstream orientation recovers very quickly to the incoming flow strength. The inspection of the vorticity contours around the mussel also highlights clear differences between orientations, with the structure of a shear layer under the upstream orientation changing to a region of concentrated vorticity near the siphons for the downstream cases. The variation of the net flux through the mussel along with the frequency of partial closures captured by the gape sensor measurements illustrate a potential added bioenergetic cost to the mussel feeding when facing downstream, especially at higher flow speeds.

T1  - What scares a mussel? Changes in valve movement pattern as an immediate response of a byssate bivalve to biotic factors
AN  - 2255253105
AB  - Responsiveness to biotic factors is crucial for the survival of sessile aquatic animals. They cannot escape from danger, but developed a number of defences against predation, usually delayed in time. We checked the initial defence of the freshwater byssate zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, associated with valve gaping. We tested the effect of chemical signals: fish predator scent (the roach Rutilus rutilus), conspecific alarm cue and a mixture of both, as well as a mechanical stimulus: the presence of an amphipod (Dikerogammarus villosus) mechanically irritating mussels. The alarm cues and amphipod presence made mussels spend more time with closed/narrowly open valves, which can be related to decreasing detection probability by reduced infochemical excretion and/or protecting soft tissues in the presence of an imminent threat. In contrast, reactions to the predator scent alone were much weaker. Moreover, the fish scent mixed with alarm substance induced weaker responses than the alarm substance alone. Thus, the fish infochemical might mask the presence of the alarm cue components, potentially benefiting the predator. A variety of defences exhibited by mussels demonstrates the importance of the predation cue type (direct/indirect, chemical/mechanical, originating from conspecifics/predators/mixed) for the behaviour of sessile animals.

T1  - Microhabitat Heterogeneity and Population Ecology of Ribbed Mussels (<i>Geukensia demissa</i>) Near Their Northern Range Limit (Maritime Canada)
AN  - 2250841160
AB  - Population dynamics of sessile marine invertebrates are potentially affected by variation in abiotic variables among microhabitats. The ribbed mussel (Geukensia demissa), an ecosystem engineer in salt marshes from Cape Cod to northern Florida, inhabits two microhabitats in salt marshes near its northern range limit, Maritime Canada: the exposed seaward edge of the marsh (edge) and the edge of creeks (creek). To determine differences in population dynamics of ribbed mussels between these microhabitats, population, demographic, and abiotic variables were measured at multiple sites over 1 to 2 years. Water flow was higher, temperature less variable, and winter shoreline disturbance less prevalent along creeks than edges. Mussels showed some minor demographic differences between microhabitats: a slightly delayed onset of gametogenesis, and a tendency to lower female reproductive output and more settlers (although overall numbers were low) within creeks. These differences did not translate into consistent differences in population variables across microhabitat types, namely density, size structure, and individual growth of juveniles and adults. Although creeks appear to be more suitable habitat based on abiotic variables measured, mussel population variables may be limited by a combination of temperature and food availability or quality, or some other factor. Overall, population dynamics of ribbed mussels are similar between creek and edge microhabitats in salt marshes in Maritime Canada. This study contributes a first assessment of the dynamics of a potentially key salt marsh species near its northern range limit.

T1  - Competition fluctuates across years and seasons in a 6-species-fish community: empirical evidence from the field
AN  - 2228412095
AB  - Competition not only occurs between species, but (probably more importantly) also among individuals within species, especially, for species occurring in high densities and when resources are limiting. Fluctuating densities and dietary overlap may account for massive ecological and evolutionary changes in fish communities. We sampled a mixed juvenile (0+ stages, being younger than 1 year of age) fish community at the Lower Rhine over three consecutive years, including native and newly established species (~ 64,000 captured individuals and ~ 4200 dissected fish). Our aim was to develop a new approach in which data on density, individual consumption rates, and diet overlaps (both intra- and interspecific) solely originating from the natural environment, were used and combined to estimate species-specific competitive strengths within and between seasons and species. The juvenile fish community at the food-limited Rhine was dominated by invasive gobies. Species-specific consumption rates decreased depending on the dietary overlap with other juveniles. Two invasive gobies (Neogobius melanostomus and N. fluviatilis) showed the greatest competitive abilities, followed by a third invasive Gobiid species (Ponticola kessleri) and the native Aspius aspius, a species utilizing an exclusive food source. Both other native species (Perca fluviatilis and Sander lucioperca) had the lowest estimates of food-related competitive strength, indicating that these species are forced into a juvenile competitive bottleneck by the invasive gobies, before they finally can develop into successful predators on gobies later in life. Our new analytical approach to measure dietary competitive strength among individuals provides a powerful tool to empirically study eco-evolutionary feedback dynamics in the field.

T1  - The Assessment and Management of Marine Pest Risks Posed by Shipping: The Australian and New Zealand Experience
AN  - 2308243530
AB  - Ships have been translocating species around the world for hundreds of years but attempts to understand and manage this issue date back only three decades. Here we review the assessment and management of risks from vessel biofouling and ballast water over this time period from an Australian and New Zealand perspective. We detail a history of successes and failures at the science-policy interface that include international guidelines for biofouling management and the recent ratification of a ballast water convention. We summarise the efficacy and costs of current treatment options, and highlight the practical challenges and policy implications of managing the diffuse and succinct bio-invasion risks that shipping creates pre- and post-border. We then use the lessons learnt over the last 30 years to recommend a future empirical strategy.

T1  - Vessel In-Water Cleaning or Treatment: Identification of Environmental Risks and Science Needs for Evidence-Based Decision Making
AN  - 2308244285
AB  - The accumulation of aquatic organisms on the wetted surfaces of vessels (i.e., vessel biofouling) negatively impacts world-wide shipping through reductions in vessel performance and fuel efficiency, and increases in emissions. Vessel biofouling is also a potent mechanism for the introduction and spread of marine non-indigenous species. Guidance and regulations from the International Maritime Organization, New Zealand, and California have recently been adopted to address biosecurity risks, primarily through preventive management. However, appropriate reactive management measures may be necessary for some vessels. Vessel in-water cleaning or treatment (VICT) has been identified as an important tool to improve operating efficiency and to reduce biosecurity risks. VICT can be applied proactively (i.e., to prevent the occurrence of, or to remove, microfouling (i.e., slime) or prevent the occurrence of macrofouling organisms - large, distinct multicellular organisms visible to the human eye), or reactively (i.e., to remove macrofouling organisms). However, unmanaged VICT includes its own set of biosecurity and water quality risks. Regulatory policies and technical advice from California and New Zealand have been developed to manage these risks, but there are still knowledge gaps related to the efficacy of available technologies. Research efforts are underway to address these gaps in order to inform the regulatory and non-regulatory application of VICT.

T1  - The lethal effect of hydrotechnical concrete on freshwater Bivalvia
AN  - 2326016256
AB  - Most hydrotechnical buildings under construction demand the concrete mixture to be set directly under water. The main reason for such a procedure is to limit the washing away of the the concrete binding mixture and to increase the efficiency of organisation of work so as to ensure continuity in concreting. The impact on the aquatic environment of recent developments in concrete technology and the use of new components has not yet been established. Natural pebble aggregate containing portland cement and fugacious siliceous ash as a binder was used to prepare BP concrete samples, while concrete marked LB was composed with lightweight aggregate and portland cement as a binder. The aim of this paper was to answer to the question whether hydrotechnical concrete of different compositions (BP and LB) and the technology of setting in a water habitat have any influence on the life condition of commonly occurring Dreissena polymorpha (Mollusca, Bivalvia). The lethal effect of two types of freshly hardening concrete was observed. In the case of LB concrete the lethal outcome for D. polymorpha could be the effect of a considerable increase of electrolytic conduction in the test cultivation. In the case of BP the parameters of electrolytic conductivity and pH did not exceed the values appearing in lakes. The possibility of the occurrence of toxic compounds of D. polymorpha, arising from the reaction of the aquatic / lake environment or the elution of some components should be taken into account. D. polymorpha serves as an indicator of toxicity in the aquatic environment and therefore can be used as a model organism in the analysis of the influence concrete on the natural environment. The results obtained in this study indicate the significant impact of modern chemical composition of concrete on the aquatic environment and the living organisms that cover it. They underline the need for research based on the hydrobiont reaction to the substances used in the natural environment.

T1  - Spatial and temporal patterns of foraging activity by breeding Common Scoters (Melanitta nigra) in Scotland
AN  - 2305779639
AB  - Many populations of sea ducks have declined; poor foraging conditions in freshwater breeding habitats could be a contributory factor. The UK breeding population of Common Scoters (Melanitta nigra) declined by 63% between 1995 and 2007, prompting research which showed that lake use by breeding scoters was correlated with food abundance (large invertebrates) and accessibility (shallow water). Building on this earlier work, here we investigate scoter foraging activity at Scottish breeding lakes, in order to better understand declines and inform conservation measures. We hypothesised that foraging effort would (i) be concentrated in shallow water holding large invertebrates, (ii) differ between sexes, and (iii) vary through the season. We recorded scoter foraging activity during 208 c. one-hour watches, at 13 lakes over three years. Water depth and food abundance (invertebrates) were measured. Foraging was significantly associated with shallow water: areas within 10 m of lake shores, typically less than 0.9 m in depth, had 1.9 and 4.1 times more foraging use than expected by chance, for females and ducklings respectively. Where large invertebrates were relatively abundant, the association with shallow water was weaker, implying that abundant food facilitated foraging across a wider range of water depths. Contrary to expectations, males and females expended similar foraging effort on breeding lakes. We discuss various interpretations of this result, and recommend tracking studies to help resolve these. There was no evidence that foraging effort of pre-breeding females or broods varied seasonally. Our study highlights the value of shallow water and large invertebrates to breeding Common Scoters. Conservation action should therefore seek to protect and enhance these habitat elements, for example via management of water levels or fisheries.

T1  - Influence of surrounding land-use on mussel growth and glycogen levels in the St. Croix and Minnesota River Basins
AN  - 2267280400
AB  - Freshwater mussels face threats from climate change and changing land use that are dramatically altering their habitat. The health of mussel populations and the state of current and past environmental conditions can be monitored by measuring mussel growth and glycogen levels. In this study, we measured growth and glycogen levels in mussels from two small river basins impacted by different land uses. The Snake River in the St. Croix Basin, Minnesota, had low levels of suspended sediments and was surrounded mostly by forest and some developed land. The Chippewa, Cottonwood, and Le Sueur rivers in the Minnesota River Basin had significantly higher annual suspended sediment loads and highly agricultural basins. Mussel growth was highest in the Le Sueur and Cottonwood rivers followed by the Chippewa and the Snake rivers. Mussels in the Minnesota Basin rivers all had higher mussel foot glycogen concentrations than the Snake River. These patterns were similar for two mussel species, suggesting that environmental conditions are likely determining levels of growth. Although agriculture had a negative effect on mussel population abundance and diversity, it had a positive effect on growth and glycogen levels.

T1  - Shifts in diet of an apex predator following the colonisation of an invasive fish
AN  - 2243956797
AB  - Roach is an invasive cyprinid fish species that has been introduced to many Irish lakes, causing broad changes in fish community dynamics. This paper examines whether roach invasion is associated with temporal change in the diet of pike in colonised systems. The seasonal diet of pike in three Irish lakes was compared between a historical (pre-roach) data set collated on a monthly basis in the 1960s and 1970s, and recent samples collected monthly over 1 year in 2016–2017. Statistical models indicated a significant increase between sampling periods in the probability of observing cyprinids in pike stomachs, and corresponding significant decreases in the probability of observing perch or brown trout. Small pike were significantly less likely than large pike to have salmonid prey in their stomach. There were seasonal effects on diet, with invertebrates and sticklebacks being consumed more in Winter–Spring compared to Autumn–Summer. In the recent period, prey selection indices indicated positive selection for roach and negative selection for perch; indices for trout tended towards neutrality. The dietary shift in pike following the establishment of roach may have alleviated predation pressure on native trout (and perch), with implications for food web structure in invaded lakes.

T1  - Enhanced ambient UVB radiation affects post-mating, but not pre-mating sexual traits in a fish
AN  - 2230482394
AB  - Organisms inhabiting shallow aquatic habitats currently experience increasing levels of solar ultraviolet B radiation (UVB). UVB causes damage on cellular and molecular levels and can affect associated life-history traits either through direct exposure or indirectly through oxidative stress generation. We examined UVB effects on pre- and post-mating sexual traits in three-spined stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus). Adult, reproductively non-active males were assigned to two exposure treatments under semi-natural conditions in an outdoor experiment; one group received natural radiation (UVBnormal) whilst the other group received additional UVB (UVBenhanced). After two months, colour metrics were used to quantify male breeding colouration as pre-mating trait. At the post-mating stage, sperm morphology, number and movement as well as testes mass were determined. Males did not significantly differ in sexual ornamentation between treatments, but UVBenhanced fish had smaller testes as well as fewer and shorter sperm than UVBnormal fish. Sperm movement was not significantly different between treatments. However, in UVBenhanced males, linear and progressive movement of sperm was positively correlated with sperm morphology (head-to-tail length ratio), whereas in UVBnormal males this relationship was negative (but not significant). Additionally, there was a significant treatment by body condition interaction concerning head-to-tail length ratio, i.e. head-to-tail length ratio increased with condition in UVBnormal males whereas there was no relationship in UVBenhanced fish. Our findings reveal that increased UVB levels influence post-mating fitness-relevant traits in males whilst having no significant impact on pre-mating sexual traits, suggesting selective UVB-effects at the gamete level with consequences for reproductive performance.

T1  - New Alien Species <i>Mytilopsis Leucophaeata</i> and <i>Corbicula Fluminalis</i> (Mollusca, Bivalvia) Recorded in Georgia and Notes on Other Non-Indigenous Molluscs Invaded the South Caucasus
AN  - 2264706594
AB  - First records of invasive bivalve freshwater mollusc species Mytilopsis leucophaeata (Conrad, 1831) and Corbicula fluminalis (O. F. Müller, 1774) in Georgia are reported. No native or alien extant dreissenid species have ever been recorded form this region so far. A finding of C. fluminalis in Georgia is also a new record for the country though this species inhabits the rivers of adjacent Azerbaijan. Apart from two mentioned bivalve molluscs three non-indigenous gastropod species are registered from Georgia: freshwater Ferrisia californica (Rowell, 1863) and Physella acuta (Draparnaud, 1805) and land snail Eobania vermiculata (O. F. Müller, 1774).

T1  - Differences in the abilities of native and invasive amphipods to tolerate poor water quality and recolonise degraded habitats
AN  - 2190840929
AB  - It has been hypothesised that freshwater pollution may favour the establishment of tolerant invaders at the expense of less-tolerant residents. To test this, this study capitalises on the aftermath of a farm pollution incident, a slurry discharge to a small British stream, which eliminated the resident macroinvertebrate assemblage. Stream transplant bioassay experiments at the discharge site revealed a higher pollution tolerance of the invasive amphipod Crangonyx pseudogracilis and the isopod Asellus aquaticus than that of the native amphipod Gammarus duebeni celticus and the invasive Gammarus pulex. A. aquaticus recolonised the stream up to the discharge point within days, followed by C. pseudogracilis, then G. pulex, with G. duebeni celticus undetected after a month. Values of a macroinvertebrate-derived biotic index of organic water quality, the Average Score Per Taxon (ASPT), gradually increased up to the discharge point in the 30 days following the incident. In a larger-scale survey (72 river and 12 pond sites), inclusion/exclusion of Gammarus spp. had no effect on ASPT values, while inclusion of C. pseudogracilis increased values, despite an assumed equivalence of these amphipods in the index. Pollution could facilitate the establishment of tolerant invaders, and this has implications for biomonitoring.

T1  - Non-indigenous tanaid <i>Sinelobus vanhaareni</i> Bamber, 2014 in the Polish coastal waters – an example of a successful invader
AN  - 2200012756
AB  - The paper reports on the first record of Sinelobus vanhaareni, a non-native tanaid, in the Polish coastal waters (Gulf of Gdansk, southern Baltic Sea). The species was found in the port of Gdynia in 2014, while in 2015–2017 it already colonized the western part of the Gulf of Gdansk, inhabiting mainly hard substrates, including both natural (e.g. boulders) and anthropogenic ones (e.g. vertical concrete piles or walls of offshore structures and breakwaters, horizontal PVC plates and oyster shells used as filling in habitat collectors). During the survey period, S. vanhaareni was found in different seasons of the year (from winter and early spring to autumn), which, combined with the presence of ovigerous females as well as high abundance (up to tens of thousands of individuals per square meter), allows us to assume that the species has already established a population in the Gulf of Gdansk.

T1  - Decline of freshwater gastropods exposed to recurrent interacting stressors implying cyanobacterial proliferations and droughts
AN  - 2167528021
AB  - Freshwater biota increasingly undergo multiple stressors, but we poorly understand to what extent they influence the dynamics of community structure. Here, we study the impact of combined stressor exposure on gastropods at 9-year interval, through a monthly 1-year (2013) monitoring, also providing data on the occurrence of other macroinvertebrate taxa. Previous study in 2004 showed the occurrence of cyanobacterial proliferations, drought, trematode parasites and invasive non-native pulmonate Physa acuta. During the year 2013, we always detected cyanobacterial microcystins (MCs) in gastropods, from 59 to 4149 ng g−1 fresh mass (vs. 0–246 ng g−1 in 2004), suggesting a continuous and increased MC intoxication. Environmental intracellular MC concentrations were high (8–41 µg L−1) from August to October 2013, whereas they were detected only in August 2004 (17 µg L−1). In 2013, we recorded no trematodes among the 2490 sampled gastropods, and P. acuta represented 94% of gastropods (vs. 58% in 2004). After August 2013, nearly all gastropods disappeared as most other macroinvertebrates (except Chironomidae, Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera). The whole decline of gastropods and other macroinvertebrates, and the absence of trematodes strongly suggest adverse conditions in the study site. Despite acute stressful conditions suggested above, gastropod abundance was 13-fold higher in June 2013 (vs. 2004), reflecting successful recolonization and efficient breeding. Most gastropods exposed to drought and toxic bloom were young vulnerable stages. Thus, we supposed alternation of local gastropod extinctions versus recolonization that could induce, on a long term, a loss of diversity to the detriment of the most sensitive species.

T1  - Feeding ecology of generalist consumers: a case study of invasive blue catfish <i>Ictalurus furcatus</i> in Chesapeake Bay, Virginia, USA
AN  - 2059342739
AB  - Globally, invasive species cause extensive economic damage and are a major threat to biodiversity. Generalist species are particularly dangerous invaders, as they can thrive in degraded habitats and endure environmental stochasticity, often outcompeting more specialized native taxa. Blue catfish Ictalurus furcatus were first introduced into the Chesapeake Bay during the 1970s, and now form dense populations in several tidal rivers. Despite being labeled as a dangerous invasive, the feeding ecology of this species is largely unknown. We used a stratified random design to collect stomachs from 16,110 blue catfish in tidal freshwater, oligohaline, and mesohaline segments of the James, Pamunkey, Mattaponi, and Rappahannock Rivers. Indices of diet breadth and omnivory reveal that blue catfish are generalist omnivores with some of the highest diet breadths ever observed in an estuarine fish species, while trophic level calculations demonstrate that blue catfish are a mesopredator occupying lower trophic levels than previously claimed. Cumulative prey curves revealed that large numbers of stomachs are necessary to adequately characterize the diet of blue catfish, thus previous diet descriptions of this species should be considered with caution. Blue catfish feed primarily on invasive aquatic vegetation and Asian clams, though the economically-valuable blue crab Callinectes sapidus is also consumed regularly. While the per capita impact of blue catfish on imperiled native species appears to be low, this impact could still be substantial due to high population densities.

T1  - Epizoic rotifers on <i>Dreissena polymorpha</i> in relation to biotic factors
AN  - 2127090804
AB  - Mollusks represent one of the most important components of freshwater zoobenthos and their shells provide a substrate for many organisms creating epibiotic communities of predominantly facultative nature. We determined rotifer species that colonize shells of Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas, 1771) without and with presence of large Cladocera and fish, alone and together. The experiment was conducted in 12 mesocosms filled with water from the littoral zone of a eutrophic lake. The experiment involved four treatments (three replicates each): (1) control of D. polymorpha in lake water; (2) D. polymorpha in lake water with the addition of large Cladocera; (3) D. polymorpha in lake water with the addition of fish; and (4) D. polymorpha in lake water with the addition of large Cladocera plus fish. The study revealed that epizoic rotifer fauna found on D. polymorpha is relatively abundant and rich in species, different from plankton communities in the same mesocosms, and specific, that is, include species that prefer this habitat. It may also suggest that communities of epizoic rotifers are impacted by the presences of benthic predators, as well as by small fish and large crustaceans inhabiting littoral waters.

T1  - Opportunities and Challenges for the Sustainability of Lakes and Reservoirs in Relation to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
AN  - 2652784487
AB  - Emerging global threats, such as biological invasions, climate change, land use intensification, and water depletion, endanger the sustainable future of lakes and reservoirs. To deal with these threats, a multidimensional view on the protection and exploitation of lakes and reservoirs is needed. The holistic approach needs to contain not just the development of economy and society but also take into account the negative impacts of this growth on the environment, from that, the balance between the three dimensions can be sustained to reach a sustainable future. As such, this paper provides a comprehensive review on future opportunities and challenges for the sustainable development of lakes and reservoirs via a critical analysis on their contribution to individual and subsets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Currently, lakes and reservoirs are key freshwater resources. They play crucial roles in human societies for drinking water provision, food production (via fisheries, aquaculture, and the irrigation of agricultural lands), recreation, energy provision (via hydropower dams), wastewater treatment, and flood and drought control. Because of the (mostly) recent intensive exploitations, many lakes and reservoirs are severely deteriorated. In recent years, physical (habitat) degradation has become very important while eutrophication remains the main issue for many lakes and ponds worldwide. Besides constant threats from anthropogenic activities, such as urbanization, industry, aquaculture, and watercourse alterations, climate change and emerging contaminants, such as microplastics and antimicrobial resistance, can generate a global problem for the sustainability of lakes and reservoirs. In relation to the SDGs, the actions for achieving the sustainability of lakes and reservoirs have positive links with the SDGs related to environmental dimensions (Goals 6, 13, 14, and 15) as they are mutually reinforcing each other. On the other hand, these actions have direct potential conflicts with the SDGs related to social and economic dimensions (Goals 1, 2, 3 and 8). From these interlinkages, we propose 22 indicators that can be used by decision makers for monitoring and assessing the sustainable development of lakes and reservoirs.

T1  - Biocontamination of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages in Croatian major rivers and effects on ecological quality assessment
AN  - 2582791426
AB  - We studied the composition of non-indigenous macroinvertebrate species (NIMS) and biocontamination level in four major large Croatian rivers (the Danube, Sava, Drava and Mura) to establish which environmental parameters are the most important for the composition of NIMS assemblages and to determine how NIMS affect biological metrics regularly used in ecological quality assessment. We sampled benthic macroinvertebrates at 48 sites (44 lotic + 4 lentic), and among 236 taxa, 21 NIMS were identified, of which 9 were widespread and abundant. Only 14.6% of sites exhibited no biocontamination, 18.7% exhibited low or moderate biocontamination and 66.7% exhibited high or severe biocontamination. Higher biocontamination in the Drava may be due to both the proximity to the Danube as the main source of NIMS and the existence of three large reservoirs. We found significantly negative correlation between the number of NIMS and native taxa. The significant correlations between biocontamination indices and tested biological metrics were as follows: negative with %EPT, EPT-S, BMWP and IBE AQEM, while positive with HR-SI. This indicates that at sites where NIMS are abundant and native taxa scarce, standard biological metrics could provide unreliable results and compromise the assessment of ecological status of large rivers.Alternate abstract: Nous avons étudié la composition des macroinvertébrés non indigènes (NIMS) et le niveau de biocontamination de quatre grands fleuves croates (Danube, Sava, Drava, Mura) pour établir quels paramètres environnementaux sont les plus importants pour la composition des assemblages NIMS et pour déterminer comment les NIMS affectent les paramètres biologiques régulièrement utilisés dans les évaluations écologiques. Nous avons échantillonné des macroinvertébrés benthiques sur 48 sites (44 lotiques + 4 lentiques) et parmi 236 taxons, 21 NIMS ont été identifiés, dont neuf étaient répandus et abondants. Seulement 14,6 % des sites ne présentaient aucune biocontamination, 18,7 % présentaient une biocontamination faible ou modérée et 66,7 % présentaient une biocontamination élevée ou grave. Une biocontamination plus importante dans la Drava pourrait être due à la fois à la proximité du Danube, principale source de NIMS, et à l'existence de trois grands réservoirs. Nous avons constaté une corrélation négative significative entre le nombre de NIMS et les taxons indigènes. Les corrélations significatives entre les indices de biocontamination et les mesures biologiques testées étaient les suivantes : négatives avec %EPT, EPT-S, BMWP, IBE AQEM et positives avec HR-SI. Cela indique que sur les sites où les NIMS sont abondants et où les taxons indigènes sont rares, les mesures biologiques standard pourraient fournir des résultats peu fiables et compromettre l'évaluation de l'état écologique des grandes rivières.

T1  - Opportunities and Challenges for the Sustainability of Lakes and Reservoirs in Relation to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
AN  - 2550490161
AB  - Emerging global threats, such as biological invasions, climate change, land use intensification, and water depletion, endanger the sustainable future of lakes and reservoirs. To deal with these threats, a multidimensional view on the protection and exploitation of lakes and reservoirs is needed. The holistic approach needs to contain not just the development of economy and society but also take into account the negative impacts of this growth on the environment, from that, the balance between the three dimensions can be sustained to reach a sustainable future. As such, this paper provides a comprehensive review on future opportunities and challenges for the sustainable development of lakes and reservoirs via a critical analysis on their contribution to individual and subsets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Currently, lakes and reservoirs are key freshwater resources. They play crucial roles in human societies for drinking water provision, food production (via fisheries, aquaculture, and the irrigation of agricultural lands), recreation, energy provision (via hydropower dams), wastewater treatment, and flood and drought control. Because of the (mostly) recent intensive exploitations, many lakes and reservoirs are severely deteriorated. In recent years, physical (habitat) degradation has become very important while eutrophication remains the main issue for many lakes and ponds worldwide. Besides constant threats from anthropogenic activities, such as urbanization, industry, aquaculture, and watercourse alterations, climate change and emerging contaminants, such as microplastics and antimicrobial resistance, can generate a global problem for the sustainability of lakes and reservoirs. In relation to the SDGs, the actions for achieving the sustainability of lakes and reservoirs have positive links with the SDGs related to environmental dimensions (Goals 6, 13, 14, and 15) as they are mutually reinforcing each other. On the other hand, these actions have direct potential conflicts with the SDGs related to social and economic dimensions (Goals 1, 2, 3 and 8). From these interlinkages, we propose 22 indicators that can be used by decision makers for monitoring and assessing the sustainable development of lakes and reservoirs.

T1  - Trophic Features, Benthic Recovery, and Dominance of the Invasive <i>Mytilopsis Sallei</i> in the Yundang Lagoon (Xiamen, China) Following Long-Term Restoration
AN  - 2550472480
AB  - A comprehensive set of physicochemical variables in near-bottom water and surface sediments, as well as the soft-bottom macrozoobenthic assemblages were investigated at six sites across the Yundang Lagoon (Southeast China) in November 2012. This lagoon was severely damaged in the 1970s due to domestic and industrial pollution and land reclamation and underwent a massive restoration effort over the past 30 years. Our objectives were to: (1) assess the current trophic and environmental condition of the lagoon; (2) investigate the pattern of spatial variation in the macrozoobenthic assemblages; and (3) assess the benthic recovery in relation to the main environmental gradients and the presence of invasive alien species. Nutrient, chlorophyll-a, biological oxygen demand (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand (CODMn), and total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations were lower than those reported in previous decades, yet organically-enriched conditions occurred at an inner site. From azoic conditions in the 1980s and a few benthic species reported prior to this study, we found a significant increase in benthic diversity with 43 species heterogeneously distributed across the lagoon. The invasive bivalve Mytilopsis sallei was the dominant species, which was associated with the richest benthic assemblage. However, M. sallei is a pest species, and its spatiotemporal distribution should be carefully monitored. These results highlight the central role of the macrozoobenthos in providing important ecological information on the current status of the Yundang Lagoon and as an effective biological tool to follow the recovery’s progress and the future evolution of this highly valued ecosystem.

T1  - Monitoring the Invasion of Smooth Cordgrass Spartina alterniflora within the Modern Yellow River Delta Using Remote Sensing
AN  - 2287893990
AB  - The Smooth Cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora, was introduced into the modern Yellow River Delta in 1989 to protect banks and beaches within the intertidal zone. By 2018, its distribution area had expanded to 4005.89 ha, which was 2557 times its initial colonization area. The distribution of S. alterniflora in the modern Yellow River Delta at given times and its ecological and biological effects have been studied previously; however, its invasion rate and characteristics, which affect its comprehensive management, are not known. Using multi-resolution and multi-platform remote sensing time series data from 1989 to 2018, combined with years of field data, the invasion of S. alterniflora within the modern Yellow River Delta was studied. These data show that S. alterniflora began to expand rapidly in 2011, after a 22-y incubation period within the modern Y ellow River Delta. Its expansion mainly occurred via seed reproduction. In addition, S. alterniflora preferentially invaded intertidal deltaic areas, using local seagrass beds as colonization sites. There was a significant correlation between the increase in area of S. alterniflora and the decrease in pollutant concentration of the Yellow River. Clearly, the improvement in water quality of the Yellow River accelerated the invasion of S. alterniflora within the delta.

T1  - Use of a rapid roadside survey to detect potentially invasive plant species along the Garden Route, South Africa
AN  - 2182376837
AB  - Early detection of emerging or sleeper weeds and monitoring of alien plant invasions forms the foundation of effective invasive alien plant management. Using a rapid roadside survey technique, we aimed to (1) establish a baseline of alien plant distribution and abundance along roads in the Garden Route, South Africa, and (2) identify priority species (particularly sleeper weeds) and priority areas to inform appropriate management action. We surveyed along 530 km of roads and recorded 109 alien and/or extralimital species across 1942 point locations. Of these, 35 species were considered to be sleeper weeds on account of displaying estimated dispersal distances distinctive of invasive plants and not being listed by the  South African Plant Invaders Atlas  (SAPIA) or regulated by South African legislation. Roads along natural forest and fynbos vegetation (often within the Garden Route National Park) displayed lower incidences of alien plants than those associated with degraded or transformed land, with roads along farmland associated with the highest incidences of alien plants. Roads in the Southern Cape region had more species and higher densities of alien plants than roads in the Tsitsikamma region, and a few species were exclusive to either.
 Conservation implications  : Our inventory contributed significant new records and range extensions to SAPIA, while the identified sleeper weeds offered suggestions for species that may be considered for regulation under the  National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act  of South Africa. We furthermore provided information to facilitate (1) timely management of emerging invasive alien plants, (2) prioritisation of species and areas for management action, and (3) future monitoring of alien plants in the Garden Route National Park and surrounds.

T1  - Subtidal Microphytobenthos: A Secret Garden Stimulated by the Engineer Species Crepidula fornicata
AN  - 2308097035
AB  - The slipper limpet Crepidula fornicata is an emblematic invasive species along the northeast Atlantic coast. This gregarious gastropod lives in stacks of several individuals and forms extended beds in shallow subtidal areas. The effects of this engineer species on the colonized habitat can be physical (e.g., presence of hard-shell substrates with uneven topography) or biological (e.g., nutrient enrichment by direct excretion or via biodeposition). We hypothesized that through biological activity, nutrient fluxes at the sediment-water interface are enhanced, leading to stimulated primary productivity by microphytobenthos (MPB) associated with Crepidula beds. To test this fertilization hypothesis, we conducted a 10-day mesocosm experiment using C. fornicata (live and dead) placed on top of sieved and homogenized sediment collected in situ. We used hyperspectral imaging to non-invasively map the development of MPB biomass, and to assess the potential influence of C. fornicata and its spatial extent. Our results showed that live C. fornicata significantly promote MPB growth through both physical and biological effects, with the biological effect dominating over the pure physical one. The highest stimulation was observed on the shells, suggesting that dissolved metabolic products excreted by C. fornicata were likely the main factor stimulating MPB growth in our short-term experiment. Our findings provide first direct evidence that stimulation of MPB growth by the biological activity of larger benthic epifauna occurs not only in intertidal but also in shallow subtidal habitats. More research is needed to assess the contribution of this fertilization effect to the trophic functioning of subtidal benthic systems.

T1  - Evaluation, Gap Analysis, and Potential Expansion of the Finnish Marine Protected Area Network
AN  - 2308094501
AB  - Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are considered to be an essential tool for safeguarding marine biodiversity. Sustainable use of the oceans and seas relies on the benefits of MPAs, now even more than ever, due to environmental degradation and anthropogenic impacts on marine ecosystems. Various international and regional agreements require that nations designate sufficiently marine areas under protection. MPAs are powerful tools, if coherent and ecologically efficient. Assessing the functionality of MPA networks is challenging, unless extensive data on underwater species and habitats is available. We evaluated the efficiency of the Finnish MPA network by utilizing a unique new dataset of ~140 000 samples, collected by the Finnish Inventory Programme for the Underwater Marine Environment VELMU. For the evaluation of MPAs, we used comprehensive data on: species distribution and abundance models for over 100 taxa, IUCN Red List of Ecosystems, fish reproduction areas, EU Habitats Directive Annex I Habitats and human pressures. Using the quantitative conservation planning and spatial prioritization method Zonation, we identified sites of high biodiversity and developed a balanced ranking of underwater conservation values. Only 27 % of the ecologically most valuable features were covered by the current MPA network. Based on the analyses a set of expansion sites were identified, complementing the ecological and geographical gaps in the current MPA network. Increasing the protected sea area by just one percent with the selection of the most valuable areas indicated by the analysis, the protection level of biological features could be significantly increased. We also discovered that the EU Directive habitats are not in their present form functional proxies for marine benthic species. This suggests that MPA networks based on habitats are not sufficient for safeguarding marine biodiversity in the northern Baltic Sea. Furthermore, the produced rankings are essentially environmental value maps, they can be used in ecosystem-based marine spatial planning and impact avoidance, including, e.g., siting of wind energy or aquaculture. Our approach and analytical procedure can be replicated elsewhere in the Baltic Sea and in other marine areas around the world, provided sufficient data exists.

T1  - European large perialpine lakes under anthropogenic pressures and climate change: present status, research gaps and future challenges
AN  - 2110110949
AB  - The aim of this review is to introduce and critically comment the main research topics considered in a selection of papers on the European large perialpine lakes (LPL) presented at the XXXIII congress of the International Society of Limnology in 2016. Besides highlighting ongoing research advancements in the LPL, the review provides a critical overview of the scientific information available on the large lake’s ecosystems, identifying a few emerging research topics (e.g., aquatic ‘omics’ and high frequency monitoring). Many limnological investigations are linked to the concept of scientific monitoring, following a “problem solving” approach connected with the management of water resources. Experimental studies and modeling are restricted to specific niches. Overall, the scientific knowledge is quite scattered, showing hot-spots of specialized or integrated research in specific lakes and areas. The advancement of new knowledge in the LPL should rely on a better integration of scientific disciplines using multidisciplinary approaches, and on the continuous adoption of new advanced technologies and tools, contributing, besides basic research, to the next generation monitoring approaches. Finally, the preservation of LPL has to rely on water protection policies addressed towards the sustainable development of both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, following the “green” and “blue” infrastructure concepts.

T1  - Temporally variable niche overlap and competitive potential of an introduced and a native mysid shrimp
AN  - 2063999251
AB  - Temporal patterns of interspecific interactions and their correspondence with life history events are of key significance for community dynamics, but often overlooked in characterising the mechanisms of species invasions and predicting competitive outcomes. Here, we examine the role of seasonality in moderating interactions between a globally important invasive mysid shrimp (Hemimysis anomala) and an ecologically similar native species (Mysis salemaai) by combining distribution and diet surveys with experimental quantification of comparative resource exploitation rates and mutual aggressive interactions. We found partial overlap in winter, but not summer horizontal distributions of the two species. Diets were highly similar in the seasonally overlapping range, potentially resulting in competition for the high-quality, but seasonally scarce, zooplankton prey in invaded lakes. Despite its smaller size, H. anomala had similar feeding rates to M. salemaai on three key zooplankton prey species. H. anomala was more aggressive toward M. salemaai than M. salemaai was toward H. anomala, although there was no evidence for intraguild predation. Our findings indicate that spatio-temporal niche partitioning permitted invasion by H. anomala and coexistence with M. salemaai, in spite of their high trophic similarity.

T1  - Fish assemblages in deep Italian subalpine lakes: history and present status with an emphasis on non-native species
AN  - 2031164473
AB  - We provide a comprehensive overview of the status of fish assemblages in eight Italian subalpine lakes using multiple data sources: historical records, standardised sampling and fishery catch statistics. Thirty-four fish species were recorded, twenty of which are native, seven introduced historically and another seven introduced recently. The number of fish species in individual lakes has increased by between 25 and 65% from 1855 to the present, with the increase being higher in the larger lakes. Non-native species contributed between 4.0 and 71.5% to standardised catches by numbers and between 4.8 and 65.1% by biomass. Roach Rutilus rutilus and pumpkinseed Lepomis gibbosus dominated electrofishing and benthic catches by number, while open-water catches were dominated by the coregonids European whitefish Coregonus lavaretus and gangfish Coregonus macrophthalmus. In terms of biomass, electrofishing catches were dominated by crucian carp Carassius carassius, largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides and wels catfish Silurus glanis, benthic catches were dominated by roach, European whitefish and crucian carp, and open-water catches by coregonids. Commercial fisheries are important ecosystem services provided by subalpine lakes, with their harvests now dominated by non-native species. To deliver effective biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services provision, the prioritisation of targets and interventions of management of non-native species is needed.

T1  - Persistence of antibiotic resistance genes in large subalpine lakes: the role of anthropogenic pollution and ecological interactions
AN  - 1984619071
AB  - The spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a threatening risk for human health at a global scale. Improved knowledge on the cycle of antibiotic resistance spread between human and the environment is a major requirement for the management of the current crisis. Compared to the well-studied cycle in clinical settings much less is known about the factor allowing their persistence in the environment. In fact, lakes and rivers exposed to high anthropogenic impact seem to become long-term reservoirs for resistance genes. The presence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) within the resident microbiome of large subalpine lakes (i.e. Lake Geneva, Lake Maggiore) has recently been investigated in both the water column and the sediment. These studies suggest a correlation between the abundance of some ARGs and the anthropogenic impact. Within the system, however, abiotic factors and the food-web structure determine the survival of specific bacterial genotypes and thus the resistance genes they harbour. Thus, a growing body of work suggests an important role of ecological interactions in the persistence or elimination of such genes from the environment. This article reviews the current literature regarding the presence of ARGs in subalpine lakes, the impact of anthropogenic pollution on their appearance and the potential role of various ecological interactions on their persistence in the system.

T1  - An expanded fish-based index of biotic integrity for Great Lakes coastal wetlands
AN  - 2101771102
AB  - Biotic indicators are useful for assessing ecosystem health because the structure of resident communities generally reflects abiotic conditions integrated over time. We used fish data collected over 5 years for 470 Great Lakes coastal wetlands to develop multi-metric indices of biotic integrity (IBI). Sampling and IBI development were stratified by vegetation type within each wetland to account for differences in physical habitat. Metrics were evaluated against numerous indices of anthropogenic disturbance derived from water quality and surrounding land-cover variables. Separate datasets were used for IBI development and testing. IBIs were composed of 10–11 metrics for each of four vegetation types (bulrush, cattail, water lily, and submersed aquatic vegetation). Scores of all IBIs correlated well with disturbance indices using the development data, and the accuracy of our IBIs was validated using the testing data. Our fish IBIs can be used to prioritize wetland protection and restoration efforts across the Great Lakes basin. The IBIs will also be useful in monitoring programs mandated by the Agreement between Canada and the United States of America on Great Lakes Water Quality, such as for assessing Beneficial Use Impairments (BUIs) in Great Lakes Areas of Concern, and in other ecosystem management programs in Canada and the USA.

T1  - Marine Biosecurity Crisis Decision-Making: Two Tools to Aid “Go”/“No Go” Decision-Making
AN  - 2307796888
AB  - Determining if a marine species is introduced to an area is an important first step when considering if control or eradication should be attempted. This step is often challenging, especially when data and introduced species expertise is limited: yet decisions about responding to a new invasion needs to occur in a timely manner. The crux is that biosecurity crisis decisions are often made in a vacuum. To improve this process, we outline a rapid response approach that uses a non-probabilistic decision tree to direct decision makers, with additional criteria to determine if a species is native, cryptogenic or introduced. The expanded criteria were derived from patterns within a 10-year dataset of quantitative introduced marine species surveys and is compared against the original Chapman and Carlton 10-point criteria for identifying a species status. Effective use of the rapid response decision-tree and species criteria requires a multi-disciplinary approach drawing upon biology (taxonomy, phylogeny, genetics, ecology, biogeography) and monitoring. The criteria are evaluated against 213 bryozoan species present in Australian waters that were randomly selected from species present in the Australian port surveys and available in the scientific and grey literature. A multivariate evaluation highlighted that a weight of evidence using the expanded criteria approach was successful in determining if a species is introduced or native, and that a number of criteria may be rarely met but when they are met, they provide strong evidence that a species is introduced. The expanded criteria clearly differentiated introduced and cryptogenic species from native species and consequently would reduce mis-classifications of introduced species as native species (Type I error) in comparison to the original criteria. However, differentiating between introduced and cryptogenic species was problematic, especially when using the original criteria. Using both the rapid response decision tree and the criteria provides a quantifiable mechanism to aid decision-makers in deciding whether to respond to a marine species introduction.

T1  - Advantages and Limitations of Environmental DNA/RNA Tools for Marine Biosecurity: Management and Surveillance of Non-indigenous Species
AN  - 2307819111
AB  - To enable successful management of marine bioinvasions, timely and robust scientific advice is required. This knowledge should inform managers and stakeholders on the magnitude of a pressure (rate of human-mediated introductions), the environmental state of an ecosystem (impacts of non-indigenous species), and the success of management response (prevention, eradication, mitigation). This advice often relies on baseline biodiversity information in the form of measureable parameters (metrics). This can be derived from conventional approaches such as visual surveys, but also by utilizing environmental DNA/RNA-based molecular techniques, which are increasingly being touted as promising tools for assessing biodiversity and detecting rare or invasive species. Depending on the stage of incursion, each approach has merits and limitations. In this review we assess the performance of biosecurity-relevant biodiversity parameters derived from eDNA/eRNA samples and discuss the results in relation to different stages of invasion and management applications. The overall performance of considered methods ranged between 42 and 75% based on defined criteria, with target-specific approaches scoring higher in general. Caveats are discussed along with avenues which may enhance these techniques and their successful uptake for marine biosecurity surveillance and management. To facilitate and encourage uptake of these techniques, there is a need for an international collaborative framework aimed at unifying molecular sampling and analysis methodologies. Improvement of quantitative capacity and cost-efficiency will also enhance their integration in biosecurity programmes.

T1  - Management of invasive populations of the freshwater crayfish <i>Procambarus clarkii</i> (Decapoda, Cambaridae): test of a population-control method and proposal of a standard monitoring approach
AN  - 2096324182
AB  - Invasive species are one of the main threats to biodiversity. When an alien species is introduced into a new environment, fast identification and definition of management strategies may avoid or minimize impacts. When an invasive species is already established, the most adopted approaches are population control and monitoring. In order to perform such strategies, assessment of characteristics of the invasive population is imperative. This study tested a new method of population size estimation and monitoring in an invasive population of crayfish Procambarus clarkii in a conservation area in the Atlantic Rain Forest (Southeastern Brazil). The population dynamics was studied for 1 year to examine the efficacy of the selected method and to evaluate if the population is stable. Later, the effect of periodical removal of animals on the population size was tested. The method of population estimation used in this study proved to be very effective. We recommend using it to monitor invasive populations of P. clarkii. The population size varied discretely over the year with variable but low growth rate, indicating that the population is already established which introduce a notable threat to native species. The continuous removal of specimens proved to be inefficient since the growth rate was higher after the removal. One intensive removal event might be more effective than a continuous moderate removal as the one applied in this study.

AB  - The golden mussel (Limnoperna fortunei) and Corbicula fluminea are considered well-established invasive species in the rivers of Brazil and South America. In addition to the environmental problems resulting from this invasion process, the economic issue, especially in hydroelectric dams, is very worrisome and has mobilized several types of studies on these invasive bivalves. The detection and identification of these organisms in their adult phase in the rivers is not a problem; however, the identification of bivalve larvae by usual morphological methods is difficult due to high similarity conserved in these stages. The use of PCR-RFLP has proven to be an efficient and agile molecular method that allowed the detection of different patterns in the agarose gel for the two bivalves tested. The gel pattern showed a 100 bp band for L. fortunei not detected for C. fluminea. Thus, it is possible to detect larvae of these species from water samples, which can be a powerful tool for environmental monitoring programs on aquatic invasive species.

T1  - Flatworms like it round: nematode consumption by <i>Planaria torva</i> (Müller 1774) and <i>Polycelis tenuis</i> (Ijima 1884)
AN  - 2041055834
AB  - The aim of this study was to enhance current knowledge of thus far largely neglected meiofaunal–macrofaunal trophic channels in freshwater ecosystems. The strength and shape (functional response) of the predator–prey interaction between two freshwater triclad flatworm species (Polycelis tenuis and Planaria torva) and individuals of the nematode species Caenorhabditis elegans were measured in a set of laboratory experiments. We hypothesized that feeding on adult nematodes results in a hyperbolic type II, whereas juvenile prey led to sigmoidal type III functional response and that different habitat textures would affect predation success by providing refuge for prey. However, our results revealed that both flatworm species exhibited type III sigmoidal functional response curves and the smallest predator consistently ingested larger amounts of nematodes. Generally, our results suggest the existence of a strong predator–prey interaction, given that both flatworms daily ingested a significant proportion of their biomass by feeding only on nematodes (up to 30% for P. tenuis). However, P. torva was unable to process nematodes in sandy sediment, and the ingestion rates of both flatworm species were reduced in a complex litter habitat.

T1  - Effect of temperature on behavior, glycogen content, and mortality in Limnoperna fortunei (Dunker, 1857) (Bivalvia: Mytilidae)
AN  - 2417690996
AB  - Limnoperna fortunei (Dunker 1857) is a freshwater mussel with physiological tolerance to different environmental conditions, which may explain its success as an invasive species. The role of abiotic factors in its establishment, abundance and projections of risk of further spread into several areas has been studied. These mussels may respond to multiple environmental stressors, such as temperature, through physiological mechanisms, behavioral responses, mortality or some combination of these. The aim of this study was to investigate the behavioral responses (valve closing), glycogen concentrations and mortality of L. fortunei under four different temperatures (5°C, 10°C, 20°C and 30°C) during a chronic test (30 days). Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare glycogen concentrations across days of the experiment and at the different temperatures. Differences in valve-closing behavior and mortality among temperatures were tested using repeated-measures ANOVA. We observed that most of the mussels maintained at 5°C closed their valves (74.7±15.3%), indicating that they remain inactive at low temperatures. The glycogen levels significantly differed among the temperatures tested. These differences occurred mainly due to the high glycogen values observed in mussels exposed to 10°C. Stability in glycogen concentrations was observed within each particular temperature. The cumulative mortality was higher at extreme temperatures (5°C and 30°C). The ideal temperature for laboratory maintenance and tests is approximately 20°C. Our data also show that L. fortunei can survive and maintain their energy reserves (glycogen) for several days at 5°C, an important feature related to its invasion success.

T1  - Eutrophication erodes inter-basin variation in macrophytes and co-occurring invertebrates in a shallow lake: combining ecology and palaeoecology
AN  - 2063160452
AB  - Aquatic biodiversity is commonly linked with environmental variation in lake networks, but less is known about how local factors may influence within-lake biological heterogeneity. Using a combined ecological and multi-proxy palaeoecological approach we investigated long-term changes in the pathways and processes that underlie eutrophication and water depth effects on lake macrophyte and invertebrate communities across three basins in a shallow lake—Castle Lough, Northern Ireland, UK. Contemporary data allow us to assess how macrophyte assemblages vary in composition and heterogeneity according to basin-specific factors (e.g. variation in water depth), while palaeoecological data (macrophytes and co-occurring invertebrates) enable us to infer basin-specific impacts and susceptibilities to nutrient-enrichment. Results indicate that variability in water depth promotes assemblage variation amongst the lake basins, stimulating within-lake macrophyte assemblage heterogeneity and hence higher lake biodiversity. The palaeo-data indicate that eutrophication has acted as a strong homogenising agent of macrophyte and invertebrate diversities and abundances over time at the whole-lake scale. This novel finding strongly suggests that, as eutrophication advances, the influence of water depth on community heterogeneity is gradually eroded and that ultimately a limited set of eutrophication-tolerant species will become homogeneously distributed across the entire lake.

T1  - The role of mobile consumers in lake nutrient cycles: a brief review
AN  - 2021758144
AB  - We summarise current understanding of consumer recycling in lake nutrient cycles and expand on it by integrating emerging knowledge from food web ecology. The role of consumer nutrient recycling (CNR) is initially framed in the wider context of lake nutrient cycling, which includes hydrodynamic and biogeochemical processes, and their responses to global environmental change. Case studies are used to demonstrate that effects of CNR on lake ecosystems range widely, from reduced nutrient cycling rates to exacerbation of eutrophication. CNR depends on consumer biomass, body size and diet, remaining relatively consistent through the year and becoming important as other fluxes seasonally ebb. Universal patterns in food web structure, for example, consumer–resource biomass ratios, body size scaling and relationships between trophic level and diet breadth, are used to demonstrate the predictability of CNR effects. Larger, mobile, top predators excrete nutrients at a lower rate but over a wider range, linking nutrient cycles across habitats. Smaller-bodied, lower trophic level consumers have strong localised nutrient cycling effects associated with their limited mobility. Global environmental-change drivers that alter food web structure are likely to have the greatest impact on CNR rates and should direct future studies.

T1  - Elevated temperatures suppress inducible defenses and alter shell shape of intertidal mussel
AN  - 2057316704
AB  - As ocean temperatures continue to rise due to climate change, many questions remain on how coastal species will cope with a changing environment. The effects of increased temperatures on bivalves has been well examined through single-species studies, showing reductions in tissue mass, shell growth, oxygen uptake, feeding rates, and survival. However, the consequences of these effects on predator–prey interactions remain poorly understood. We examined how increased temperatures (30, 32, 34 °C) and the presence of water-borne predation cues from blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) affected the morphology and growth rate of southern ribbed mussels (Geukensia granosissima), as well as their handling times when attacked by predatory crabs. Although southern ribbed mussels were able to survive under chronic heat stress, exposure to higher temperatures resulted in more elongated shell shapes. Growth rates in mussel wet weight were higher for mussels reared in the presence of a predator than in the predator-free control, but only in the low-temperature treatment. Likewise, handling times were greater for crabs eating mussels grown in the presence of a predator, but the effect was lost at the mid- and high-temperature treatments. These findings suggest that predation-induced defenses were suppressed when prey were under chronic thermal stress, which could make mussels more vulnerable to predation. The presence of predation cues in natural environments should be taken in consideration when estimating or predicting the effects of climate change on organisms.

T1  - Food web changes associated with drought and invasive species in a tropical semiarid reservoir
AN  - 2039102923
AB  - Fish and invertebrates are introduced in freshwaters around the world for commercial purposes, despite widely known impacts on food webs and biological invasions. As a proxy for artificial environments, we modeled a typical reservoir in a Brazilian semiarid region using an ecosystem approach. We compared the role of native and non-native invasive species (NIS) in the food web, between dry and wet periods, and under the influence of an extreme drought period (from 2011 to 2015), simulating the variation in fish biomasses due to decreasing consumption. Key ecosystem groups were fishes (mainly NIS), birds, and insects. Nutrient cycling was dependent on invaders, while the trophic structure was detritus based during the drought. Biomass of detritivores was almost two times higher than herbivores, and native fish species decreased abruptly in response to invaders and volume variation. The dominance of low-trophic levels (TLII) and tilapia—Oreochromis niloticus (Linnaeus, 1758) and other tilapiines—resulted from interactions among invaders, feeding behavior on benthos, and environmental seasonality, tending toward biotic homogenization (“benthification”) at the ecosystem level. An increasing relevance of detritivores with cascading effects in ecosystems subject to drought, multiple introductions, and ubiquitous food sources has clear implications for the fisheries and the water quality.

T1  - Seasonal feeding ecology of co-existing native and invasive benthic fish along a nearshore to offshore gradient in Lake Michigan
AN  - 2026185437
AB  - Relative abundance, diet composition and feeding strategy were determined for three benthic fish, the native deepwater sculpin Myoxocephalus thompsonii (Girard, 1851) and slimy sculpin Cottus cognatus (Richardson, 1836), and the invasive round goby Neogobius melanostomus (Pallas, 1814), along a nearshore to offshore gradient in southeastern Lake Michigan during March–December 2010, 2015, and 2016. Round goby were most abundant in the nearshore (<25 m), slimy sculpin were most abundant in the transitional zone (35–65 m), and deepwater sculpin were most abundant in the offshore zone (>75 m). Despite a large degree of spatial separation, some species did overlap, with slimy and deepwater sculpin occurring in sympatry throughout the year in the offshore and transitional zones, and round goby overlapping with both sculpin species seasonally in the transitional zone. Deepwater sculpin exhibited specialization on Mysis diluviana in all depth regions. Slimy sculpin in the offshore reduced diet overlap with deepwater sculpin by specializing on fish eggs during spring and fall, whereas in the transitional depth zone, there was considerable overlap between sculpin species due to the high importance of Mysis in diets. The invasive round goby had a mixed diet, with some diet overlap with native sculpin, especially slimy sculpin, in the transitional zone. In the nearshore zone, round goby displayed a generalized diet with many prey contributing to the diet, but the average contribution of any prey was generally low. Spatial separation and variable feeding strategies help reduce, but not eliminate shared resource use amongst these benthic fish in Lake Michigan.

T1  - mtDNA analysis of <i>Mytilopsis</i> (Bivalvia, Dreissenidae) invasion in Brazil reveals the existence of two species
AN  - 2021172055
AB  - The genus Mytilopsis includes some of the most invasive estuarine bivalves in the world, and M. leucophaeata (native to the Gulf of Mexico) and M. sallei (indigenous in the Caribbean Sea) are the most often reported species. Molecular investigations of the COI gene in invasive populations of M. leucophaeata in Europe found only one haplotype, whereas the invasive M. sallei in Asia had high haplotype diversity. The present study investigated COI variability of invasive populations previously identified as M. leucophaeata in Brazil, located at the cities of Recife and Rio de Janeiro. Our genetic analysis revealed that the record of M. leucophaeata from Recife appears erroneous; this population forms a clade adjacent to but genetically separated from the Asian M. cf. sallei. Similarly, samples from Rio de Janeiro clustered close to but not within European/North American sequences of M. leucophaeata. The Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery test suggested the existence of three species: M. leucophaeata, M. cf. sallei (Asia), and M. cf. sallei (Recife), which merit confirmation with nuclear DNA sequences. The discovery of two lineages of Mytilopsis in Brazil augments concerns about their expansion.

T1  - The invasive freshwater bivalve <i>Limnoperna fortunei</i> in South America: multiannual changes in its predation and effects on associated benthic invertebrates
AN  - 2015472159
AB  - The invasive golden mussel Limnoperna fortunei is known to strongly affect benthic communities in South American freshwaters, but the evolution of these effects after the early invasion stages is poorly understood. Using predator exclusion (covered with 15- and 40-mm meshes) and inclusion (unprotected) substrates, we investigated the interaction between golden mussels and benthic invertebrate communities at different levels of exposure to predators in the Paraná River delta. Colonization of the substrates was largely dominated by the mussels. Oligochaeta, Nematoda, and Hirudinea were the most abundant accompanying groups, while Rotifera, Tardigrada, Copepoda, Cladocera, Chironomidae, Gastropoda, Hydracarina, Amphipoda, and nauplii appeared sporadically. Regardless of their different trophic modes and functional attributes, the numbers and biomass of associated invertebrates were not only enhanced by protection against predators, but also by the presence of mussel colonies. Enhancement of invertebrate densities associated with mussel colonies was higher on unprotected than protected substrates, suggesting that invertebrate facilitation increases with increasing predation pressure. Comparisons with a similar study carried out a decade earlier suggest that, after two decades of invasion, the reproductive potential of the mussel, the predation pressure on its colonies, and its facilitation effects on other invertebrates have increased in the Paraná River delta.

T1  - Abundance of invasive peacock bass increases with water residence time of reservoirs in southeastern Brazil
AN  - 1977502584
AB  - Neotropical freshwater ecosystems are experiencing a great expansion in the number of invasive species, which is especially alarming since this region harbours 30% of the world’s fish biodiversity with high levels of endemism. We aimed to evaluate the main predictors of peacock basses (Cichla spp.) abundance outside their native range, which are the Amazon and Tocantins-Araguaia river basins. We used multivariate ordination techniques and multimodel inference to analyse peacock basses abundance in twelve reservoirs of the Paraíba do Sul river basin, southeastern Brazil. Interestingly, reservoirs at higher (southernmost) latitudes, located in more populated areas, had higher water temperature and lower turbidity, due to increased water residence time, and these three variables were also positively correlated with abundance of this warm-water invasive fish. Habitat structure was less important in explaining peacock basses abundance, which was not significantly related to biotic factors (fish species richness and time since peacock basses introduction). We hypothesize that the observed effects of reservoir management on limnological features and peacock bass abundance, particularly water residence time (as a mediator of temperature and turbidity), may apply to other Neotropical basins and could influence the impact of this invader.

T1  - Phosphorus Dynamics and Availability in the Nearshore of Eastern Lake Erie: Insights From Oxygen Isotope Ratios of Phosphate
AN  - 2307784173
AB  - Blooms of filamentous benthic algae that plagued Lake Erie in the 1950s through 1970s were largely reduced through reductions of phosphorus (P) loading from point sources. Since the mid-1990s, these blooms have returned despite a period of relatively stable external P inputs. While increased loadings of dissolved P have been causally linked to cyanobacterial blooms in some parts of the lake, the impacts of ecosystem changes such as the effect of invasive species on nutrient cycling and availability have not been fully elucidated, leading to uncertainty as to the effectiveness of additional non-point P management actions. Here we use the oxygen isotope ratios (18OP) of phosphate in concert with measures of water quality along the northern shore of the east basin of Lake Erie to identify sources and pathways of P cycling and infer potential importance in relation to annual blooms of Cladophora that foul the shorelines of eastern Lake Erie. 18OP data indicate that potential external source signatures are rapidly overprinted by biological cycling of P by the plankton community and that much of the available phosphate in the nearshore waters is derived from hydrolysis of dissolved organic P compounds. Near the dreissenid-colonized lake bed, 18OP was persistently and significantly enriched in 18O relative to 18OP measured in surface waters and was similar to 18OP of phosphate excreted by dreissenid mussels in incubations. These results implicate dreissenid mussels as key agents in nearshore P cycling and highlight the importance of considering ecosystem changes in the development of nutrient management strategies designed to ameliorate symptoms of eutrophication.

T1  - Effects of harbour excavating and dredged sediment disposal on the benthic invertebrate fauna of River Danube (Austria)
AN  - 2015459831
AB  - Dredging Austrian Danube harbours becomes necessary to keep the navigation channel free from bed sediment and to insure safe navigation, especially after major floods. In most cases, the excavated substrate is deposited in the free-flowing river section in the vicinity of the mouth of a harbour. The effects of harbour dredging on the biota need to be studied to minimize possible outcomes that may endanger the ecological status of the river system in order to implement the aims of the European Water Framework Directive. This study presents the first quantitative information on the colonisation of benthic invertebrates with respect to Danube harbours. One sampling at Linz Harbour was conducted before dredging and four samplings were carried out after dredging. Four transects were documented in the affected river section. The study used an air-lift sampler and a grab sampler to investigate if and to what extent the benthic invertebrate community is disturbed. It found that the sediment dredging heavily affected the benthic invertebrates (decline of 82% of biomass), while the dumping of the material had no effects on the benthic Danube biota. As a rough estimate (conferring to a simple trend line analysis) the harbour bottom fauna would recover after 235 days.

T1  - Biological Invasions in Conservation Planning: A Global Systematic Review
AN  - 2307800081
AB  - Biological invasions threaten biodiversity in terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems, requiring substantial conservation and management efforts. To examine how the conservation planning literature addresses biological invasions and if planning in the marine environment could benefit from experiences in the freshwater and terrestrial systems, we conducted a global systematic review. Out of 1149 scientific articles mentioning both ‘conservation planning’ and ‘alien’ or any of its alternative terms, 70 articles met our selection criteria. Most of the studies were related to the terrestrial environment, while only 10% focused on the marine one. The main conservation targets were species (mostly vertebrates) rather than habitats or ecosystems. Apart from being mentioned, alien species were considered of concern for conservation in only 46% of the cases, while mitigation measures were proposed in only 13% of the cases. The vast majority of the studies (73%) ignored alien species in conservation planning even if their negative impacts were recognized. In 20% of the studies, highly invaded areas were avoided in the planning, while in 6% of the cases such areas were prioritized for conservation. In the latter case, two opposing approaches led to the selection of invaded areas: either alien and native biodiversity were treated equally in setting conservation targets, i.e. alien species were also considered as ecological features requiring protection, or more commonly invaded sites were prioritized for the implementation of management actions to control or eradicate invasive alien species. When the ‘avoid’ approach was followed, in most of the cases highly impacted areas were either excluded or invasive alien species were included in the estimation of a cost function to be minimized. Most of the studies that followed a ‘protect’ or ‘avoid’ approach dealt with terrestrial or freshwater features but in most cases the followed approach could be transferred to the marine environment. Gaps and needs for further research are discussed and we propose an 11-step framework to account for biological invasions into the systematic conservation planning design.

T1  - Are Changes in Lower Trophic Levels Limiting Prey-Fish Biomass and Production in Lake Michigan?
AN  - 2262014785
AB  - To improve understanding of how recent changes in lower trophic levels in Lake Michigan could be affecting prey-fish biomass and production, the Lake Michigan Committee (LMC) convened a Lower Trophic Level Task Group and provided several charges that are responded to in this report. First, we compiled a comprehensive summary of lower trophic-level data in Lake Michigan, separating out nearshore versus offshore trends over time. Declining trends were prevalent in offshore time series for phosphorus, chlorophyll a, biomass of total crustacean zooplankton, biomass of herbivorous cladocerans, and density of Diporeia spp. In the nearshore, declining trends were evident only for biomass of cyclopoid copepods and density of Diporeia spp. Second, we hypothesized specific mechanisms by which changes in lower trophic levels could affect prey-fish biomass and production and described the degree of empirical support for each mechanism. The best-supported hypothesis was that declining invertebrate prey (especially Diporeia spp.) was responsible for declining growth of prey fish, especially over the last decade when competition for prey resources should otherwise have been lessened due to declining prey-fish densities. As a result, declining growth potentially limits the prey-fish biomass that could have been attained had growth been maintained at the levels that were achieved in the 1980s and earlier. Third, we prioritized several lower trophic-level indicators that fishery managers could use to better inform decision making. The top-ranked indicator was annual reporting of Alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) condition. Fourth, we prioritized the key monitoring and research gaps that limit our current understanding of how lower trophic levels influence fish production. The highest-priority monitoring gap was coordinated sampling of the nearshore, which, if accomplished, would complement annual reporting on offshore sampling. The top-ranked knowledge gap was identifying bottlenecks that regulate fish recruitment, given that recent changes in zooplankton distribution and abundance could be suppressing survival of larval fish and, ultimately, the biomass and production of prey fish. We provided three specific recommendations for the LMC to consider as they seek to better incorporate lower trophic-level changes into their management decision process: (1) implement a coordinated and standardized nearshore monitoring program, (2) encourage funding agencies to use our prioritized lists in their decision processes, and (3) foster the already improved dialogue between those researching lower trophic levels and those researching fisheries.

T1  - Ichthyofauna of the Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Plant cooling pond (Enerhodar, Ukraine) and its biomeliorative significance
AN  - 2061498147
AB  - The article presents the results of comprehensive research of the fish fauna of the cooling pond of the Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Plant. The species composition of the fish fauna and the main limiting factors affecting the structure of the ichthyocenosis of the reservoir have been studied. It is noted that the fish fauna is dominated by invasive species (57%), most of which are introduced for the biological melioration in a cooling pond. The decrease in the number of native fish species is caused both by the spread of invasive species and by the factor of high water temperature. The latter factor limits the number of fish species that do not tolerate a rise in water temperature (roach Rutilus rutilus (Linnaeus, 1758), bream Abramis brama (Linnaeus, 1758), rudd Scardinius erythrophthalmus (Linnaeus, 1758)). The paper also presents the results of studies on the nutrition spectrum of fish living in the Zaporizhia NPP cooling pond. The dynamics of catches of the main ameliorative species over the last 10 years has been analyzed. Practical recommendations on the stocking the heat sink with ameliorative fish for the period of 2018-2022 are given.

T1  - Development of general condition and flesh water content of long-time starved Mytilus edulis-like under experimental conditions
AN  - 2056426804
AB  - Mussels of the family Mytilidae are known for the two commercial important species in Europe, Mytilus edulis (Linneaus, 1758) (blue mussel) and Mytilus galloprovincialis (Lamarck, 1819) (Mediterranean mussel). To guarantee adequate production and quality in aquaculture general condition of the stock is routinely monitored, either by shell growth rate, soft body weight or condition index (CI). This study tested over 218 days (about 8 months) the starvation capability of blue mussels from the Baltic Sea, a low salinity environment, under fully controlled conditions. Because these mussels, genetically, represent two different species, M. edulis and M. trossulus (Gould, 1850), we examined a combination of both, as common in the western Baltic Sea. During experimental time the water temperature was kept at 15°C (±1°C) and 15 PSU (±1 PSU). Test animals physiology was verified by standard procedures, e.g. by CI, shell length growth rate and flesh water content. M. edulis-like mussel starvation capacity was high, 93 of 100 tested animals survived the entire 8 months. The CI decreased from initial 20.0 to 5.2 (loss of 74%) as well as the soft body weight retrospectively from initial 1.95 to 0.54 g (loss of 72%). The water content of the soft body increased from initial 95% to 98.4%. Regarding the total length of the mussels a decrease was found which ranged between the initial stocking sizes of the mussels (3.28 cm (±0.58 cm). We herewith demonstrate first results of the correlation of decreasing general condition, determined by CI and flesh weight, and an increase of flesh water content of blue mussels.

T1  - Heavy metal concentrations in sediments and in mussels from Argentinean coastal environments, South America
AN  - 2030106382
AB  - Among environmental contaminants, heavy metals are currently considered to be some of the most toxic ones present worldwide due to their harmful effects on organisms and ability to bioaccumulate in aquatic systems. In this work, the concentration of heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn, Ni and Cr) in Brachidontes rodriguezii and in the fine sediments of several coastal sites at the southwest of Buenos Aires Province, Argentina is analyzed. The Bahía Blanca Estuary and Pehuen-Có beach are located in a highly complex oceanographic and ecological regional system, which creates the basis of one of the most valuable Argentinean habitats for fishing commercial species. An assessment, which involved analyzing distribution pattern of trace metals, comparative studies with sediment and ecological quality guidelines; and a sequential and integrated index analyses approach (containing Metal Pollution Index, Biosediment Accumulation Factor, Geo-accumulation Index (Igeo), Pollution Load Index and the mean Probable Effect Level quotients), was followed to estimate enrichment and risks of heavy metals in the sediments and in the mussels from these study areas. The results showed higher concentrations of some heavy metals (e.g., Cd, Cr and Ni) in mussels collected at Pehuen-Có, while no spatial differences in sediments were observed. According to the international environmental regulations, mean values of trace metals in mussels allowed to place both sites between “unpolluted and moderately polluted” and between the “low and medium category” of pollution. Furthermore, the mean concentrations found were within the detected ranges in other coastal sites worldwide.

T1  - Predicting mayfly recovery in acid mine-impaired streams using logistic regression models of in-stream habitat and water chemistry
AN  - 2015464253
AB  - Mayflies (Order Ephemeroptera) require high quality water and habitat in streams to thrive, so their appearance after restoration is an indicator of ecological recovery. To better understand the importance of restoring in-stream habitat versus water chemistry for macroinvertebrate communities, we developed taxon-specific models of occurrence for five mayfly genera (Caenis, Isonychia, Stenonema, Stenacron, and Baetis) inhabiting streams in the Appalachian Mountains, USA. Presence/absence records from past decades were used to develop single and multiple logistic predictive models based on catchment characteristics (drainage area, gradient), in-stream habitat variables (e.g., substrate, channel morphology, pool and riffle quality), and water chemistry. Model performance was evaluated using (a) classification rates and Hosmer-Lemeshow values for test sets of data withheld from the original model-building dataset and (b) a field comparison of predicted versus observed mayfly occurrences at 53 sites in acid mine drainage-impaired watersheds in 2012. The classification accuracies of final models for Caenis, Stenacron, and Baetis ranged from 50 to 75%. In-stream habitat features were not significant predictor variables for these three taxa, only water chemistry. Models for Isonychia and Stenonema had higher classification rates (81%) and included both habitat and chemical variables. However, actual occurrences of Isonychia and Stenonema at study sites in 2012 were low, consistent with the calculated probability of occurrence (Po) < 0.60. Caenis occurred at test sites 35% of the time when the model predicted a Po > 0.40. Stenacron showed the greatest consistency of actual versus predicted occurrences, occurring at 56% of sites when the Po (based on pH and conductivity) was > 0.50 and only at 1 site when Po < 0.5. The results demonstrate how predictive models of individual indicator taxa could be valuable for evaluating the relative impacts of restoring physical habitat versus water chemistry during stream remediation.

T1  - Mortality of post-settlement clams <i>Rangia cuneata</i> (Mactridae, Bivalvia) at an early stage of invasion in the Vistula Lagoon (South Baltic) due to biotic and abiotic factors
AN  - 1992797642
AB  - The clam Rangia cuneata, originating from the Gulf of Mexico, was recorded in the Vistula Lagoon for the first time in the early 2010s, and quickly became the dominant component of the zoobenthic biomass. To assess mortality as a factor potentially controlling the growth of Rangia population, a year-long field experiment involving marked bivalves placed in sediment-filled trays deployed on the bottom was conducted in 2014 and 2015. Predator-induced mortality of the clams was low in summer, and very high in the winter–spring period. It was inversely proportional to the size of the clams. Such changes can be partially attributed to predation from at least five fish and three duck species, which contained clams in their digestive tracts. Non-predatory mortality particularly affected large individuals, and was highest in spring, several weeks after the end of winter. We hypothesize that it could be caused by persistent low temperatures over several winter months which led to considerable weakening of the condition of clams. A long winter could also reduce their resistance to environmental stress and potential effect of epibionts, as well as increase susceptibility to predation.

T1  - A Field Observation of Rotational Feeding by Neogobius melanostomus
AN  - 2124629207
AB  - Neogobius melanostomus, the round goby, was recorded by underwater video feeding on crushed dreissenid mussels at a depth of 12 m in Georgian Bay of Lake Huron, a Laurentian Great Lake. In the video, gobies used rotational or twist feeding to tear away particles from crushed mussels. At least 43 examples of this feeding maneuver occur in the video. Up to 120 gobies m−2 were visible at a time in the video. Mean standard length of gobies appearing in the video was 37 mm. Mean standard length of fish exhibiting twist feeding was larger, 48 mm. Mean size of intact mussels in visible clusters was about 10 × 20 mm, a size which exceeds the gape width of the largest gobies observed in the video. Neogobius melanostomus is known to use twisting to wrest small attached mussels from the substrates which can be crushed by their pharyngeal teeth. I surmise that the behavior observed in the video is an opportunistic manifestation of this inherent behavioral adaptation to overcome gap limitation and exploit a temporary windfall of food.

T1  - Can introduced species replace lost biodiversity? A test with freshwater molluscs
AN  - 2002402962
AB  - Human activity has dramatically accelerated both species extinctions and introductions, and the balance of these two processes is generally expected to reduce biodiversity and increase taxonomic homogenization. However, few tests of this hypothesis have been made. We tested whether new macroinvertebrate invaders in North American freshwaters can replace the recent loss of biodiversity, particularly focusing on molluscs. We found that both crustaceans and molluscs are overrepresented among endangered and recently extinct species, as well as among invaders. For molluscs, the number of recently extinct species (79 species) was more than twice that for exotic species (38 species). In addition, molluscan invaders are from different taxonomic families than recently extinct or endangered species. While most extinct and endangered molluscs are from streams and rivers, invaders preferentially colonize lakes and reservoirs. The impact of humans on species introductions and extinctions increases with spatial scale (from local to continental scales), resulting in the increased phylogenetic dissimilarity between introduced species and native communities. Construction of dams and alteration of the flow regimes of lotic systems will continue to lead to the extinction of native species, and promote the spread of invaders, resulting in a loss of biodiversity and taxonomic homogenization.

T1  - Palatability of the Asian clam <i>Corbicula fluminea</i> (Müller 1774) in an invaded system
AN  - 2002400490
AB  - Biotic interactions such as predation may influence the success of invasive alien species (IAS). Although the Asian clam Corbicula fluminea is recognized as one of the most problematic aquatic IAS, few studies have investigated its use as a food resource. In this study, we aimed to investigate (i) the palatability of C. fluminea under natural (Minho River) and laboratory conditions and (ii) if C. fluminea submitted to different conditions (individuals from Lima and Minho Rivers) vary in palatability. Soft tissues from different Corbicula populations, plus soft tissues from a native clam, tuna and Corbicula shell powder were offered to consumers. Field assays were performed seasonally and laboratory assays only in summer; both assays also tested possible differences during distinct periods of the day. Overall, in natural conditions, the treatments containing C. fluminea had a low palatability. In laboratory assays, higher consumption (almost two times) was observed for Cyprinus carpio and Anguilla anguilla. Also, C. fluminea palatability was different between populations, with the treatment Corbicula Lima being more consumed than Corbicula Minho. Despite the low values of consumption in the field, laboratory results suggest that C. fluminea soft tissues can be a food resource to some species.

T1  - Continuous reproduction of <i>Sinanodonta woodiana</i> (Lea, 1824) females: an invasive mussel species in a female-biased population
AN  - 2002399840
AB  - The reproductive activity of females of the Chinese pond mussel (Sinanodonta woodiana) was investigated in a European population inhabiting cooling water. The study used histological and stereological methods to determine gonad structure, changes in reproductive follicles during gametogenesis, oocyte development, glochidia structure, and brooding periods. Water in the channel of the “Dolna Odra” power plant did not freeze during the winter, and its mean annual temperature was 18.4°C. The population sex ratio was female biased (χ2 = 25.70, df = 1, P < 0.0001). Ovaries in mussels were formed by reproductive follicles. Previtellogenic and vitellogenic oocytes were attached to the follicle wall via the cytoplasmic stalk, and mature ovulated oocytes were present in the follicle lumen. Individuals with mature oocytes in gonads were present over the whole two-year study period, which indicates the continuous activity of gonads. Hooked glochidia had a larval thread. Females incubated the offspring in gill marsupia of outer demibranchs and were characterized by multiple tachytictic brooding periods. All gravid individuals presented mature and spent stages of gonadal development. The study provides the first direct information about the reproductive dynamics of this invasive species outside its original Asiatic range.

T1  - Negative effects of <i>Corbicula fluminea</i> over native freshwater mussels
AN  - 2002399696
AB  - The global decline of freshwater mussels is related with a great variety of factors, including the introduction of invasive species. However, the possible effects of other invasive bivalves, such as the Asian clam Corbicula fluminea (Müller, 1774), remain mainly unknown and highly speculative with very few manipulative experiments addressing this issue. In this study, field and laboratory experiments were conducted to assess the possible negative effects of C. fluminea on the native freshwater mussel Unio delphinus Spengler, 1783. Growth, physiological condition, and the locomotor activity were assessed in U. delphinus at increasing C. fluminea density. U. delphinus exhibited lower growth, lower physiological condition, and higher locomotor activity at higher C. fluminea density, which may suggest that this unionid is negatively affected by C. fluminea and may be displaced to less favorable habitats. Although we were not able to establish the main mechanism(s) responsible for these results, possibilities include competition for food resources, competition for space which may result in mussel displacements and/or changes in microhabitat features as a result of bioturbation activities, and production of feces and pseudofeces by C. fluminea.

T1  - Next-generation sequencing of <i>Dreissena polymorpha</i> transcriptome sheds light on its mitochondrial DNA
AN  - 2002399605
AB  - Zebra mussels Dreissena polymorpha (Veneroida, Dreissenidae) are known for their invasive behavior. Despite numerous studies dealing with this species, no results of large sequencing projects have been published to date, hampering marker development. In this study, we present a relatively large novel transcriptomic dataset obtained by Illumina MiSeq technology from mantle and male gonad of D. polymorpha sampled in Poland. The transcriptomic data were typical for the tissue analyzed. Moreover, they showed the expression of a single mitochondrial genome, indicating that this species do not have doubly uniparental inheritance of mitochondria. The sequences of mitochondrial transcripts were used to design primers and obtain nearly complete sequence of the zebra mussel mitochondrial genome by PCR and Sanger sequencing. This mitogenome has unique gene order, with the genes split into two blocks encoded in opposite directions. The closest mitogenome available in GenBank belongs to the marine clam Mya arenaria (Myoida, Myidae). The average divergence of the sequences of these mitogenomes is quite high, in the range of 20%. Both mitogenomic and transcriptomic resources should prove very useful for elucidating population genetics and conservation issues involving this important species.

T1  - Phylogeography of the freshwater mussel species <i>Lasmigona costata</i>: testing post-glacial colonization hypotheses
AN  - 2002399411
AB  - Understanding genetic diversity across large spatial scales helps to reveal patterns of population structure. Mitochondrial DNA sequences and microsatellite loci were used to analyze the phylogeography of a common unionid species (Lasmigona costata) from the Laurentian Great Lakes and historically connected river drainages. Phylogeographic patterns were assessed to determine colonization routes into the Great Lakes following glacial recession. A suite of seven microsatellite loci were genotyped and a fragment of the mitochondrial gene COI was sequenced. Multiple analyses using microsatellite allele frequencies suggest at least two distinct genetic populations for L. costata. A total of seven hypothesized post-glacial dispersal scenarios were compared using isolation by distance to test the various dispersal models. Evidence was strongest for two post-glacial dispersal routes into the Great Lakes: one utilizing a connection between the Wabash and Maumee River watersheds, and one utilizing a connection between the Wisconsin River and Green Bay watersheds. A highly differentiated and monophyletic population of L. costata was identified in the Ozark Highlands, which may constitute a unique taxonomic entity.

T1  - Ecosystem services provided by freshwater mussels
AN  - 2002399264
AB  - Ecosystem services are the benefits that humans derive from ecosystems. Freshwater mussels perform many important functions in aquatic ecosystems, which can in turn be framed as the ecosystem services that they contribute to or provide. These include supporting services such as nutrient recycling and storage, structural habitat, substrate and food web modification, and use as environmental monitors; regulating services such as water purification (biofiltration); and provisioning and cultural services including use as a food source, as tools and jewelry, and for spiritual enhancement. Mussel-provided ecosystem services are declining because of large declines in mussel abundance. Mussel propagation could be used to restore populations of common mussel species and their ecosystem services. We need much more quantification of the economic, social, and ecological value and magnitude of ecosystem services provided by mussels, across species, habitats, and environmental conditions, and scaled up to whole watersheds. In addition, we need tools that will allow us to value mussel ecosystem services in a way that is understandable to both the public and to policy makers.

T1  - Conservation of freshwater bivalves at the global scale: diversity, threats and research needs
AN  - 1993455539
AB  - Bivalves are ubiquitous members of freshwater ecosystems and responsible for important functions and services. The present paper revises freshwater bivalve diversity, conservation status and threats at the global scale and discusses future research needs and management actions. The diversity patterns are uneven across the globe with hotspots in the interior basin in the United States of America (USA), Central America, Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. Freshwater bivalves are affected by multiple threats that vary across the globe; however, pollution and natural system (habitat) modifications being consistently found as the most impacting. Freshwater bivalves are among the most threatened groups in the world with 40% of the species being near threatened, threatened or extinct, and among them the order Unionida is the most endangered. We suggest that global cooperation between scientists, managers, politicians and general public, and application of new technologies (new generation sequencing and remote sensing, among others) will strengthen the quality of studies on the natural history and conservation of freshwater bivalves. Finally, we introduce the articles published in this special issue of Hydrobiologia under the scope of the Second International Meeting on Biology and Conservation of Freshwater Bivalves held in 2015 in Buffalo, New York, USA.

T1  - Challenging exploration of troubled waters: a decade of surveys of the giant freshwater pearl mussel <i>Margaritifera auricularia</i> in Europe
AN  - 1979725204
AB  - The critically endangered Giant Freshwater Pearl Mussel Margaritifera auricularia was presumed extinct before its rediscovery in Spain in 1985 and France in 2000. Since then, numerous surveys have been set up to search for living populations in France and Spain. This article presents an up-to-date account of species distribution based on available data, i.e. the literature, museum collections and recent field surveys, and provides unpublished molecular data for France. There are still three populations of the Giant Freshwater Pearl Mussel in the Ebro River in Spain, and eight populations in France (two in the Loire watershed, one in the Charente watershed, two in the Garonne watershed and three in the Adour watershed). The biggest population lives in the Charente River with an estimated 100,000 individuals. Recruitment is very scarce in all populations but living specimens estimated to be less than 10 years old have been found in the Ebro in Spain and in the Vienne, Charente, Dronne and Adour rivers in France. The recent rediscovery of populations in France was mainly a result of intensive dedicated surveys including scuba diving. Subsequent advances in knowledge show how large rivers and downstream ecosystems remain a terra incognita for the hydrobiologist.

T1  - Influence of environmental factors and biogenic habitats on intertidal meiofauna
AN  - 1975945309
AB  - This study investigated the influence of physical and chemical conditions and biotic factors on the distribution and diversity of meiofauna in intertidal zone along a geographical gradient. At 11 sites along the Italian coast, we studied the concurring role of environmental variables, trophic resources and the presence of habitat-forming species (macroalgae vs. mussels) in controlling the meiofaunal communities. The increase of water temperature combined with local thermal conditions was associated with a decrease in nematodes and copepods, with a consequent decrease in meiofaunal abundance towards the south. However, the increase in salinity, as geographical gradient decreases, and local thermal conditions favoured the settlement of a greater number of taxa, influencing communities’ composition. The presence of macroalgae or mussels differently influenced the community structure of meiofauna on intertidal substrates and their response to environmental factors. From our results, the presence of macroalgae coverage appeared to reduce the impact of thermal stress on meiofauna and was associated with higher levels of meiofaunal diversity with respect to mussels. This work highlighted the importance of considering the interplay among biotic and abiotic factors, resulting in local combinations of environmental conditions, in order to understand the pattern of diversity and distributions of marine organisms.

T1  - Influences on Water Quality and Abundance of <i>Cladophora</i>, a Shore-Fouling Green Algae, over Urban Shoreline in Lake Ontario
AN  - 2582929989
AB  - Urban centers border western Lake Ontario, the terminus of the Laurentian Great Lakes, impacting water quality on the shores of this oligotrophic lake. The green algae Cladophora proliferates on the shallow lakebed and fouls the shoreline, presenting an eutrophication concern. The conditions over a typical urbanized shoreline were studied to assess linkages between Cladophora and area nutrient sources. The most pervasive of the mixing areas of varying extent identified using field sensor measurements was associated with the discharge of treated sewage from a Water Pollution Control Plant (WPCP). Phosphorus and nitrogen were enriched at times near the WPCP diffuser and also in shallow water along the shoreline. Dissolved nutrients were also measured directly above the lakebed in close proximity to Cladophora. Dissolved phosphorus and inorganic nitrogen were higher in proximity to the WPCP diffuser at times, however, spatial patterns were not as clearly aligned with external inputs as the patterns of enrichment in the water column. Biomass distribution of Cladophora was unrelated to nutrient levels in the water column or at the lakebed. Yet, concentrations of phosphorus in Cladophora, an indicator of nutrient sufficiency, were higher near the WPCP diffuser. This disparity, while possibly an artifact of variable loss rates of biomass among locations, may in part stem from variable water clarity among areas. Abundant dreissenid mussels also potentially obscure the effects of nutrient loading on algal biomass if the sequestering of phosphorus from offshore plankton, suggested by periods of onshore circulation, approaches the extent of external loading. Further study of phosphorus flux at the lakebed is required to establish clear linkages between external nutrient loading and algal growth in order to manage the proliferation of Cladophora over urban coastline.

T1  - Trophic cues as possible triggers of mussel larval settlement in southeastern Brazil
AN  - 2196539264
AB  - Oligotrophic conditions may impose a nutritional challenge for the larval and early post-larval development of bivalves during the search for a suitable benthic habitat. Here we investigated what settlement cues might be important for mytilid populations in southeastern Brazil. Our results point to a trophic trigger mediating larval settlement that may include an effect of saturated fatty acids, probably linked to organic detritus and bacterial production deriving from terrestrial inputs. The prevalence of drifting in this population suggests it may be a strategy for individuals to delay final settlement until encountering favorable trophic environmental conditions.

T1  - Influence of environmental factors on vertical distribution of zooplankton communities in humic lakes
AN  - 2196538731
AB  - The influence of vertical environmental gradients on zooplankton communities was studied in five humic lakes with the high availability of food resources (phytoplankton and bacterioplankton) and low fish pressure. The factors that inhibit the development of large zooplankton in humic lakes are currently widely debated. We have found that relatively productive humic lakes do not offer many niches for zooplankton because of the sharp thermal gradient which results in a shallow layer of oxygenated waters. The results of this study indicated that different taxonomic groups of zooplankton are determined by a different set of environmental variables. This phenomenon explains very low species richness of zooplankton and a possibility of their coexistence in the narrow oxygenated layer. We concluded that due to sharp thermal gradient in humic lakes biomass of herbivores may be reduced which could promote development of phytoplankton.

T1  - The future of marine biodiversity and marine ecosystem functioning in UK coastal and territorial waters (including UK Overseas Territories) – with an emphasis on marine macrophyte communities
AN  - 2174302117
AB  - Marine biodiversity and ecosystem functioning – including seaweed communities – in the territorial waters of the UK and its Overseas Territories are facing unprecedented pressures. Key stressors are changes in ecosystem functioning due to biodiversity loss caused by ocean warming (species replacement and migration, e.g. affecting kelp forests), sea level rise (e.g. loss of habitats including salt marshes), plastic pollution (e.g. entanglement and ingestion), alien species with increasing numbers of alien seaweeds (e.g. outcompeting native species and parasite transmission), overexploitation (e.g. loss of energy supply further up the food web), habitat destruction (e.g. loss of nursery areas for commercially important species) and ocean acidification (e.g. skeletal weakening of ecosystem engineers including coralline algal beds). These stressors are currently affecting biodiversity, and their impact can be projected for the future. All stressors may act alone or in synergy. Marine biodiversity provides crucial goods and services. Climate change and biodiversity loss pose new challenges for legislation. In particular, there are implications of climate change for the designation and management of Marine Protected Areas and natural carbon storage by marine systems to help control the global climate system. The UK currently has legal obligations to protect biodiversity under international and European law.

T1  - Calendar and thermal time-based growth models for common carp and pikeperch, and the influence of stocking strategy in Lake Balaton, Hungary
AN  - 2161919855
AB  - Common carp Cyprinus carpio and pikeperch Sander lucioperca are widely distributed and economically important freshwater fishes. Because these species are extensively stocked both within and outside of their native ranges, it is important to assess the effect of these actions. We aimed to analyse growth rate and its variability related to stocking strategy (season × lake area × habitat × fish size) in common carp and pikeperch in Lake Balaton (Hungary), based on cooperative tagging experiments with anglers. In both species, length increment was more closely associated with thermal time (degree-day sum) over 8 °C threshold water temperature than calendar time. Except a marked decrease with increasing fish size, stocking parameters had little effect on length increment. Growth models based on the GROTAG method and the von Bertalanffy's asymptotic length (L∞) and growth rate (K) are provided. Compared to other habitats, estimated growth rate proved to be high in common carp (128 mm year−1 at 300 mm standard length) and modest in pikeperch (61 mm year−1 at 250 mm standard length). We concluded that stocking rate even might be increased in common carp, while management of the pikeperch population should rather be based on catch restriction measures than intensified stockings.
La carpe commune Cyprinus carpio et le sandre Sander lucioperca sont des poissons d'eau douce largement distribués et économiquement importants. Étant donné que ces espèces sont largement déversées à l'intérieur et à l'extérieur de leur aire de répartition naturelle, il est important d'évaluer l'effet de ces actions. Nous avons cherché à analyser le taux de croissance et sa variabilité liés à la stratégie d'empoissonnement (saison × superficie du lac × habitat × taille du poisson) chez la carpe commune et le sandre du lac Balaton (Hongrie), sur la base d'expériences de marquage en coopération avec les pêcheurs à la ligne. Chez les deux espèces, l'incrément de longueur était plus étroitement associé au temps thermique (somme des degrés-jours) au-dessus seuil de 8 °C pour la température de l'eau que le temps calendaire. Sauf une diminution marquée avec l'augmentation de la taille des poissons, les paramètres d'empoissonnement ont eu peu d'effet sur l'augmentation de la longueur. Des modèles de croissance basés sur la méthode GROTAG, et la longueur asymptotique de von Bertalanffy (L∞) et le taux de croissance (K) sont fournis. Par rapport à d'autres habitats, le taux de croissance estimé s'est avéré élevé chez la carpe commune (128 mm année−1 à 300 mm de longueur standard) et modeste chez le sandre (61 mm année−1 à 250 mm de longueur standard). Nous avons conclu que le taux d'empoissonnement pourrait même être augmenté chez la carpe commune, alors que la gestion de la population de sandre devrait plutôt être basée sur des mesures de restriction des prises que sur des empoissonnements intensifiés.

T1  - CAN THE INVASIVE NEW ZEALAND MUD SNAIL (POTAMOPYRGUS ANTIPODARUM) THREATEN FISHERIES OF TEMPERATE LAKES? A CASE STUDY FROM LAKE DUSIA, LITHUANIA
AN  - 2052766385
AB  - To date, numerous studies of the impact of snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum (Gray, 1843) on invaded ecosystems have been conducted. However, the majority of such studies intended to assess changes induced in macroinvertebrate assemblages, while the possible effects of P. antipodarum on higher trophic levels have not hitherto been studied. Of particular interest from the point of view of fisheries management is the elucidation of how this invasive snail can alter the energy flow towards higher trophic levels. When abundant, P. antipodarum consumes a substantial part of the primary production, but it is poorly consumed by native fishes. Consequently, part of its assimilated energy may become locked in lower trophic levels and fail to reach higher levels directly. Therefore, invasion of this snail may decrease fish production. Several years after establishment of P. antipodarum in a temperate mesotrophic Lake Dusia, we assessed: (1) changes in the biomass of littoral macroinvertebrates (proxy to secondary production), (2) assimilation of P. antipodarum by benthivorous fish (energy flow), and (3) changes in growth and catches of littoral benthivorous fish (fish production). All the analyses were based on a merger of "grey" literature and original data during the pre- and post-invasion periods. There was an evident increase in the biomass of littoral macroinvertebrates, and the assemblage changed from crustacean- to gastropod-dominated due to over-domination of P. antipodarum. However, P. antipodarum did not replace the native prey of fish. Moreover, a marked decrease was recorded in littoral fish growth and catches after the invasion of P. antipodarum. Dense populations of P. antipodarum may reduce the channelling of primary production towards higher trophic levels and, consequently, the invasion may threaten fisheries of temperate mesotrophic lakes.

T1  - Biological consequences of weak acidification caused by elevated carbon dioxide in freshwater ecosystems
AN  - 1970559586
AB  - Weak acidification can occur in freshwater ecosystems when free carbon dioxide (CO2) levels increase, which can happen for a variety of reasons. To define the state of knowledge for how weak acidification influences freshwater biota and ecosystems, a review of the primary literature was conducted. Despite few empirical studies focused on weak acidification in the primary literature (~100 studies), some themes have emerged from our literature review. Most studies focused on physiological responses at the organismal level, and fish were the most studied taxa. Animals exhibited reduced individual growth rates, and, in contrast, primary producers demonstrated increased individual and population growth rates. In animals, mortality, sub-lethal injuries, and changes to behaviours were also observed. Negative consequences to reproduction in macrophytes were found. Few studies have focused on population, community, or ecosystem levels, though broad scale studies suggest that weak acidification can limit species community diversity, specifically in invertebrates and fish. Moving forward, researchers need to continue to advance our understanding of the consequences of weak acidification for freshwater biota. Furthermore, priority should be placed on research that can evaluate the potential for weak acidification in freshwater to lead to changes in ecological regimes or economical outcomes, such as fisheries collapses.

T1  - First report of native Astata unicolor (Hymenoptera: Crabronidae) predation on the nymphs and adults of the invasive brown marmorated stink bug (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae)
AN  - 2041126540
AB  - Native insect predators and parasitoids can help regulate invasive insect pest species. The brown marmorated stink bug, Halymorpha halys (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), is an introduced pest of fruits and vegetables in the eastern USA that originated in Asia. Surveys for native biological control agents of this pest detected the crabronid predatory wasp Astata unicolor (Hymenoptera: Crabronidae) and the generalist predatory bug Arilus cristatus (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) using the nymphs and adults of this introduced pest as prey. Temporal distribution of the wasp was determined from water pan traps and net collections over 5 years in floral provisioning strips that were established for pollinator conservation programs in tree fruit farms. Blue vane traps used for bee monitoring did not capture A. unicolor in pollinator plant- ings. Astata unicolor was not found in 6 commercial apple orchards that were monitored concurrently using either pan or blue vane traps over a 4 yr period.Alternate abstract:Los depredadores y parasitoides nativos de insectos pueden ayudar a regular las especies invasoras de plagas de insectos. El chinche café marmorado Halymorpha halys (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae,) es una plaga introducida de frutas y verduras en el este de los Estados Unidos que se originó en Asia. En los sondeos para los agentes de control biológico nativo de esta plaga se detectó la avispa predadora crabronida Astata unicolor (Hymenoptera: Crabronidae) y el insecto predador generalista Arilus cristatus (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) utilizando las ninfas y adultos de esta plaga introducida como presa. La distribución temporal de la avispa fue determinada a partir de trampas de pozo de agua y colecciones con redes durante 5 años en tiras de flores provisionales que fueron establecidas para programas de conservación de polinizadores en los huertos de árboles frutales. Las trampas de paletas azules utilizadas para el monitoreo de las abejas no capturaron A. unicolor en las plantas para los polinizadores. No se encontró Astata unicolor en 6 huertos de manzanas comerciales que fueron monitoreados simultáneamente utilizando trampas de platos y de paletas azules durante un período de 4 años.

T1  - Aquatic biodiversity in forests: a weak link in ecosystem services resilience
AN  - 1963350170
AB  - The diversity of aquatic ecosystems is being quickly reduced on many continents, warranting a closer examination of the consequences for ecological integrity and ecosystem services. Here we describe intermediate and final ecosystem services derived from aquatic biodiversity in forests. We include a summary of the factors framing the assembly of aquatic biodiversity in forests in natural systems and how they change with a variety of natural disturbances and human-derived stressors. We consider forested aquatic ecosystems as a multi-state portfolio, with diverse assemblages and life-history strategies occurring at local scales as a consequence of a mosaic of habitat conditions and past disturbances and stressors. Maintaining this multi-state portfolio of assemblages requires a broad perspective of ecosystem structure, various functions, services, and management implications relative to contemporary stressors. Because aquatic biodiversity provides multiple ecosystem services to forests, activities that compromise aquatic ecosystems and biodiversity could be an issue for maintaining forest ecosystem integrity. We illustrate these concepts with examples of aquatic biodiversity and ecosystem services in forests of northwestern North America, also known as Northeast Pacific Rim. Encouraging management planning at broad as well as local spatial scales to recognize multi-state ecosystem management goals has promise for maintaining valuable ecosystem services. Ultimately, integration of information from socio-ecological ecosystems will be needed to maintain ecosystem services derived directly and indirectly from forest aquatic biota.

T1  - Lifting the curtain on the freshwater mussel diversity of the Italian Peninsula and Croatian Adriatic coast
AN  - 1963350068
AB  - Freshwater mussels of the order Unionida have been dramatically declining globally. Despite their ecological importance, conservation of these animals has been hindered by unresolved taxonomy and a lack of data on the distribution and status of populations, especially in southern Europe. Although the Italian Peninsula has been noted as a centre of endemism and one of the major refugia of the glacial ages for several taxa, few studies have been performed on the genetic diversity of Unionida. Most importantly, the taxonomic status of several freshwater mussel populations of the Italian Peninsula is still unresolved. Here we present the first comprehensive dataset for the Unionida of the region spanning Italy and the coastal Croatian region (west of the Dinaric Alps). In total, 191 specimens were collected (85 Anodonta, 64 Unio, 17 Microcondylaea bonellii and 25 Sinanodonta woodiana) from 34 sites across the Italian Peninsula and coastal Croatian river basins for molecular identification (COI, 16S and 28S). Genetic analyses were performed to understand major phylogenetic and phylogeographic patterns. Seven species were detected: three Anodonta species (A. anatina, A. cygnea and A. exulcerata), two Unio species (U. mancus and U. elongatulus), Microcondylaea bonellii, and the invasive Sinanodonta woodiana. The presence of three endemic species (A. exulcerata, U. elongatulus and M. bonellii) confirms the importance of the region as a centre of endemism for freshwater mussels. The Apennine Mountains act as an important biogeographic barrier.

T1  - Why experiment with success? Opportunities and risks in applying assessment and adaptive management to the Emiquon floodplain restoration project
AN  - 1959151674
AB  - The Nature Conservancy’s wetland restoration at the Emiquon Preserve has been a success to date, but there are warning signs of undesirable change if left unmanaged. A water control structure built in 2016 will increase management capabilities, but periodic connection to the river, which has experienced human alterations typical of rivers in eastern North America and Europe, also introduces risks. The Conservancy’s planning process has identified (1) management targets (e.g., diverse native fish populations); (2) Key Ecological Attributes (KEAs) that maintain the targets (e.g., relatively deep over-wintering habitats for fishes); (3) measurable indicators for the KEAs (e.g., depth in winter); and (4) desirable ranges for the indicators (e.g., 10% of the aquatic area has depths of 2–3 m and dissolved oxygen levels of 4–6 mg/l). Assessments and experiments completed to date have focused on documenting the restoration, evaluating effects of the record flood of 2013, and predicting outcomes of management actions. Simulation models of hydrology, hydraulics, and vegetation response developed during the planning process allayed some concerns of stakeholders, but not all outcomes are predictable from either current theory or management experience. Therefore, each action can be considered not only as an adaptive management experiment focused on sustaining targets, but also contributing to ecological theory and restoration practice on a broader scale.

AB  - Lower trophic levels support the prey fish on which most sport fish depend. Therefore, understanding the production potential of lower trophic levels is integral to the management of Lake Ontario's fishery resources. Lower trophic-level productivity differs among offshore and nearshore waters. In the offshore, there is concern about the ability of the lake to support Alewife production due to a perceived decline in productivity of phytoplankton and zooplankton whereas, in the nearshore, there is a concern about excessive attached algal production associated with higher nutrient concentrations--the oligotrophication of the offshore and the eutrophication of the nearshore. Here, Rudstam et al examine the status of lower trophic levels in Lake Ontario.

T1  - Using a gradient in food quality to infer drivers of fatty acid content in two filter-feeding aquatic consumers
AN  - 1949612293
AB  - Inferences about ecological structure and function are often made using elemental or macromolecular tracers of food web structure. For example, inferences about food chain length are often made using stable isotope ratios of top predators and consumer food sources are often inferred from both stable isotopes and fatty acid (FA) content in consumer tissues. The use of FAs as tracers implies some degree of macromolecular conservation across trophic interactions, but many FAs are subject to physiological alteration and animals may produce those FAs from precursors in response to food deficiencies. We measured 41 individual FAs and several aggregate FA metrics in two filter-feeding taxa to (1) assess ecological variation in food availability and (2) identify potential drivers of among-site variation in FA content. These taxa were filter feeding caddisflies (Family Hydropyschidae) and dreissenid mussels (Genus Dreissena), which both consume seston. Stable isotopic composition (C and N) in these taxa co-varied across 13 sites in the Great Lakes region of North America, indicating they fed on very similar food resources. However, co-variation in FA content was very limited, with only one common FA co-varying across this gradient (α-linolenic acid; ALA), suggesting these taxa accumulate FAs very differently even when exposed to the same foods. Based on these results, among-site variation in ALA content in both consumers does appear to be driven by food resources, along with several other FAs in dreissenid mussels. We conclude that single-taxa measurements of FA content cannot be used to infer FA availability in food resources.

T1  - Selective predation by reintroduced juvenile Lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) in Ft. Loudoun reservoir, Tennessee (USA)
AN  - 1949495116
AB  - Following water quality and minimum flow improvements to the impounded Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers, juvenile lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) have been restocked annually since 2000. Our goal was to seasonally assess foraging mode of this recovering population in Ft. Loudoun Reservoir in the Upper Tennessee River. During 2014–15, individuals were captured using trot-lines in a 13-km reach that supports the greatest density of lake sturgeon. We used colonic flushing and gastric lavage techniques to obtain diet. We took systematic benthic sediment grabs along multiple transects throughout the reach and opportunistically deployed rock cages filled with hard substrates to assess potential prey that colonize hard surfaces. Foraging modes of lake sturgeon were determined by comparing relative abundances of invertebrate taxa in the gut contents (6581 invertebrates) of 28 fish to the relative abundances of the same invertebrate taxa collected from the resource base (1667 invertebrates). Proportional similarity, Levin’s niche breadth, and Manly’s index were used to assess the degree of prey selectivity. Lake sturgeon fed selectively on a narrow range of available prey consisting mostly of larval chironomids (93% composition by number during warm season, 96% during cool season), some genera of which they prey upon selectively, primarily Chironomus sp., but to a lesser extent Procladius, Ablabesmyia, Coelotanypus, and Cryptochironomus spp. Meanwhile, other abundant taxa in the resource base were avoided, such as Oligochaetes, Hexagenia mayflies, and the chironomid Glyptotendipes. Our results illustrate that assessing seasonally available prey from habitat utilized by lake sturgeon is important when investigating diet preference.

T1  - Competition among river planktivores: are native planktivores still fewer and skinnier in response to the Silver Carp invasion?
AN  - 1949494164
AB  - Planktivorous Silver Carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix and Bighead Carp H. nobilis have successfully invaded much of the Upper Mississippi River System and its tributaries during the last 30 years. During the initial years of the invasion, concurrent declines in the body condition and the catch per unit effort (CPUE) of planktivorous Gizzard Shad Dorosoma cepedianum and Bigmouth Buffalo Ictiobus cyprinellus were attributed to competition with Asian carp. Using an additional seven years of data (2007–2013), we assessed whether Silver Carp have continued to exert adverse pressure on the condition, CPUE, and biomass of native planktivores or whether there is evidence of a potential rebound in the populations of native planktivores. The extended data set reaffirms the body condition and the CPUE of Bigmouth Buffalo remain significantly reduced. However, unlike previous analyses, we also observed significant reductions in the CPUE of Gizzard Shad. Additionally, new results show that the CPUE and biomass of Bigmouth Buffalo were more inversely related to Silver Carp CPUE and biomass relative to the CPUE and biomass of Gizzard Shad. These results reinforce that Silver Carp likely suppress native planktivores and also suggest that diet and other life-history traits may explain some of the subtle differences in species-specific responses. Our results also emphasize that long-term data can be critical to understanding how non-native species can influence native fish population dynamics and how this influence may change over time.

T1  - Predicting predatory impact of juvenile invasive lionfish (Pterois volitans) on a crustacean prey using functional response analysis: effects of temperature, habitat complexity and light regimes
AN  - 1949493972
AB  - The ecological implications of biotic interactions, such as predator-prey relationships, are often context-dependent. Comparative functional responses analysis can be used under different abiotic contexts to improve understanding and prediction of the ecological impact of invasive species. Pterois volitans (Lionfish) [Linnaeus 1758] is an established invasive species in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, with a more recent invasion into the Mediterranean. Lionfish are generalist predators that impact a wide range of commercial and non-commercial species. Functional response analysis was employed to quantify interaction strength between lionfish and a generic prey species, the shrimp (Palaemonetes varians) [Leach 1814], under the contexts of differing temperature, habitat complexity and light wavelength. Lionfish have prey population destabilising Type II functional responses under all contexts examined. Significantly more prey were consumed at 26 °C than at 22 °C. Habitat complexity did not significantly alter the functional response parameters. Significantly more prey were consumed under white light and blue light than under red light. Attack rate was significantly higher under white light than under blue or red light. Light wavelength did not significantly change handling times. The impacts on prey populations through feeding rates may increase with concomitant temperature increase. As attack rates are very high at low habitat complexity this may elucidate the cause of high impact upon degraded reef ecosystems with low-density prey populations, although there was little protection conferred through habitat complexity. Only red light (i.e. dark) afforded any reduction in predation pressure. Management initiatives should account for these environmental factors when planning mitigation and prevention strategies.

T1  - Contributions of freshwater mussels (Unionidae) to nutrient cycling in an urban river: filtration, recycling, storage, and removal
AN  - 1982581536
AB  - Consumers contribute to nutrient cycling in aquatic ecosystems by nutrient retention in tissues, metabolic transformations and excretion, and promoting microbial processes that remove nutrients (i.e., nitrogen (N) loss via denitrification). Freshwater mussels (Unionidae) form dense assemblages in rivers, and affect nutrient transformations through feeding, biodeposition, and bioturbation. However, the effects of Unionid mussels on N and phosphorus (P) retention are not commonly measured. We quantified rates of filtration, retention, and biodeposition of carbon (C), N, and P for two Unionid species: Lasmigona complanata and Pyganodon grandis. We used continuous-flow cores with 15N tracers to measure denitrification in sediments alone and with a single individual of each species. We conducted measurements in an urban river near Chicago, IL, USA that is a target for Unionid restoration. Both Unionid species showed high rates of P-specific feeding and retention, but low N-specific rates. This was in agreement with high N:P ratio in the water column. Each species significantly increased denitrification relative to sediment alone. 15N tracers suggested direct denitrification of nitrate increased denitrification, although enhanced coupled nitrification–denitrification likely also contributed to denitrification. Finally, denitrification rates with and without mussels were used to estimate the value of N loss under different scenarios for mussel restoration at the river scale. Overall, restored Unionid populations may enhance P retention in soft tissues and shells and N loss via denitrification. Ecosystem managers may find greater support for restoration of Unionid populations with careful calculations of their ecosystem role in nutrient retention and removal.

T1  - Associations between food habits and pharyngeal morphology in the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus)
AN  - 1945565004
AB  - Several studies have shown that round gobies (Neogobius melanostomus) undergo a dietary shift from arthropods to dreissenid mussels as they grow, and this shift is accompanied by changes in pharyngeal morphology associated with durophagy. In contrast, some populations of round gobies prey heavily on various arthropods, but it is unknown whether those populations develop pharyngeal morphology associated with durophagy or if they develop less robust and molarized structures. To test if there is a relationship between food habits and pharyngeal morphology, we compared those characters in round gobies from two sites in Erie Co., Pennsylvania: a dreissenid-present site (Presque Isle Bay, PIB, of Lake Erie) and a dreissenid-absent site (Fairview Gravel Pit, GP). Multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) revealed consistent ontogenetic changes at both sites in which lower pharyngeals of larger fish were more robust, possessed wider teeth, and had a greater area taken up by large diameter teeth. Pharyngeal morphology also differed between sites, with gobies from PIB having wider and more robust lower pharyngeals. Food habits differed markedly between round gobies from the two sites, with dreissenid mussels being the most important prey item for all length classes in PIB, and crustaceans being the most important prey item for all length classes at the GP. Canonical correlation analysis on all round gobies revealed a correlation between consumption of dreissenid prey and pharyngeal characters associated with durophagy. Although food habits and pharyngeal morphology of round gobies appear to be associated, the mechanism responsible for the association (i.e. phenotypic plasticity versus local adaptation) is not clear.

T1  - Abiotic factors affecting habitat selection by two invasive gammarids Dikerogammarus villosus and Pontogammarus robustoides
AN  - 1912906562
AB  - Identification of habitat preferences of invasive organisms is crucial for predicting their distribution and impact. We conducted laboratory experiments to determine preferences of Dikerogammarus villosus and Pontogammarus robustoides, invasive in Europe, with regard to ionic content (450 and 830 [mu]S/cm in a Y-maze), flow (0-30 cm/s in a flow-through tank with stagnant water refuges) and temperature (a gradient 5-35°C). D. villosus selected the lower salinity, whereas P. robustoides did not discriminate between salinities, suggesting that, the raised ionic content in large European rivers cannot explain their absence in small tributaries, as previously postulated. Gammarids never preferred flowing over stagnant water, but could stay in a flow [less than or equal to]10 cm/s without behavioural changes. They avoided flow [greater than or equal to]15 cm/s. Gammarids selected warmer water than their acclimation temperatures. Temperature selection by D. villosus was related to its acclimation temperature. The choice of P. robustoides depended on the season: it preferred a lower temperature in summer than in autumn. Therefore, its thermal preferences were more stable throughout the year, which might be advantageous in shallow, thermally variable areas. Gammarids used environmental variables to select warm, lentic, freshwater locations, which may help them locate an optimum microhabitat and thrive in temporally and spatially variable environments.

T1  - The interactive effects of temperature, trophic status, and the presence of an exotic clam on the performance of a native freshwater mussel
AN  - 1912906535
AB  - Global environmental changes constitute major threats to biodiversity in all ecosystems worldwide. Here we experimentally examined how temperature and trophic condition can influence the interaction between a highly invasive species and a native naiad species. We exposed the native freshwater mussel Unio delphinus to the presence/absence of the invasive Corbicula fluminea under three temperature levels and three trophic conditions. We used linear mixed models and hierarchical partitioning to model and test the independent effects of each variable in explaining U. delphinus feces production, which was used as a proxy for nutrient enrichment. Unio delphinus responded to high temperatures with higher clearance and respiration rates, showing an increase in energy expenditure. Feces production varied significantly with each factor and there was an interactive effect between the factors; increasing with temperature and trophic condition, and declining in the presence of the invasive clam. The hierarchical partitioning model showed that the system trophic condition and C. fluminea were the most important factors explaining feces production and to a lesser extent water temperature. Depletion of energetic reserves to cope with increasing temperatures could compromise the tolerance to additional stressors such as competition with invasive species or food reduction.

T1  - LAKE ERIE'S EASTERN BASIN 14
AN  - 2717341329
AB  - Lake Erie's eastern basin is described. The eastern basin is separated from the adjacent central basin by the submerged Pennsylvania Ridge, which crosses the lake from Long Point, Ontario, to Presque Isle PA, and extends east to the head of the Niagara River at Buffalo NY. The eastern basin has an average depth of 18.9 m, a maximum depth of 64.0 m, and makes up 24% of the lake's surface area and 32% of its volume. The eastern basin receives most of its water from the upstream central basin but also has major river inflows on the north shore from the Grand River (Ontario) and on the south shore from Cattaraugus Creek (New York). Extensive areas of marsh and wetlands are found in Long Point Bay and in the lower reaches of the Grand River. Bottom substrates vary with exposed bedrock and deposits of sand and gravel along the south shore, whereas the north shore is dominated by clay and sand. Mud bottoms predominate in the deeper waters.

AB  - Changes to the trophic status of Lake Erie since pre-settlement times have been well documented. Excessive nutrient enrichment from a variety of sources during the 1950s and 1960s moved the western basin from mesotrophic to hyper-eutrophic, the central basin from mesotrophic to eutrophic, and the eastern basin from oligotrophic to mesotrophic. By 1970, the over-enrichment of phosphorus stimulated excessive production of nuisance algae, which caused basinwide anoxia that affected drinking-water supplies, recreation, and fish communities. Here, Markham et al assess the environmental condition of Lake Erie.

T1  - LONG-TERM CHANGES IN FISH COMMUNITY STRUCTURE REVEALED BY GILLNET MONITORING IN A SHALLOW, LOWLAND RESERVOIR
AN  - 1953816680
AB  - Fish communities can support or hinder water quality management. Sulejów Reservoir, which is situated on the Pilica River in Central Poland, serves as a strategic reserve of drinking water for the Łódź Agglomeration. Precise knowledge of the long-term dynamics of the structure of the fish community, what was the aim of this study, is important for proper management to slow the eutrophication of the reservoir and prevent toxic algal blooms. To determine fish species composition, multimesh gill nets with mesh sizes ranging from 11 to 80 mm were used. From 1993 to 2015, gillnetting was conducted 1-2 times per month from June through November in two representative parts of the reservoir, and principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to explore the temporal variation in fish community structure expressed as the relative contribution of each species to the total fish biomass. Dominance fluctuated among four species in the fish community: common bream, Abramis brama (Linnaeus, 1758); roach, Rutilus rutilus (Linnaeus, 1758); white bream, Blicca bjoerkna (Linnaeus, 1758); and pike-perch, Sander lucioperca (Linnaeus, 1758). PCA revealed three principal components with eigenvalues larger than one that explained 73.3% of the observed variance in the temporal changes in fish community composition. A negative correlation was found between pike-perch biomass and roach biomass (r = 0.82), while a positive correlation was observed between the biomass of pike-perch and that of common bream (r = 0.73). Consequently, there was a highly negative correlation between the biomasses of common bream and roach (r = 0.80). Furthermore, an interesting temporal pattern was observed; from 1993 to 2000, the fish community was dominated by common bream and pike-perch but then shifted towards domination by roach and white bream, despite declining phosphorous and carbon concentrations. Recently, this trend has been reversed, and a more balanced fish community structure has been established. Fish community succession, which is usually reported to be a one-directional process in reservoirs, i.e., from a riverine fish or percid-dominated to a cyprinid (bream)-dominated state, was more ambiguous in Sulejów Reservoir. This was likely a consequence of both restoration issues related to decreasing nutrient loads and the influence of zebra mussel, Dreissenapolymorpha invasion on the trophic relations in the reservoir.

T1  - Feeding and nutrient excretion of the New Zealand freshwater mussel Echyridella menziesii (Hyriidae, Unionida): implications for nearshore nutrient budgets in lakes and reservoirs
AN  - 1910235221
AB  - Native freshwater mussels (Bivalvia: Unionoida) can represent a large portion of benthic biomass, but their functional role is still poorly understood. We sampled Echyridella menziesii (Hyriidae) in six lakes from two regions of the North Island of New Zealand to develop general allometric relationships for predicting filtration, excretion and biodeposition rates. Experimental containers were set up in the field (no-flow conditions) to measure filtration and biodeposition using natural phytoplankton communities, and excretion in filtered lake water. Filtration rates were 0.02-1.3 L mussel-1 h-1 and increased with increasing mussel size (R2=0.13, P=0.023). Stable isotope analysis suggests that mussels also assimilate food from non-planktonic origins. Nitrogen excretion rates were 4-50 [mu]g N mussel-1 h-1 and increased with mussel size (R2=0.70, P<0.0001), with no difference between regions (ANCOVA, P>0.3). In contrast, phosphorus excretion rates did not vary with mussel size, and were much lower in Rotorua than Waikato lakes (2 vs 5 [mu]g P mussel-1 h-1). The reason for this regional difference is unclear, but suggests that mussels could contribute different N:P ratios to nearshore nutrient budgets in different types of lakes. Biodeposits represented 50-70% of the N, and 25-70% of the P recycled. Echyridella filters and excretes nutrients at rates similar to those measured in North American and European mussels (Unionidae, Margaritiferidae). Mussels could be important contributors of nutrients in areas where they are abundant, and their inclusion into nutrient budget models could improve the predictions of nearshore nutrient fluxes in lakes and reservoirs.

T1  - Latitudinal incidence of phototrophic shell-degrading endoliths and their effects on mussel bed microclimates
AN  - 1899725049
AB  - Aggregations of organisms commonly benefit their members by mitigating the effects of predators and environmental stresses. Mussel aggregations also form important intertidal matrices that support associated infaunal communities, the structures of which are largely shaped by the conditions within the interstitial spaces. Intertidal mussels are frequently parasitized by phototrophic endoliths that infest the shell and have thermoregulatory effects on both solitary and aggregated mussels by changing shell albedo. A large-scale sampling was carried out May-June 2016 along Portuguese and Moroccan shores to investigate a latitudinal gradient of endolithic infestation of the intertidal mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. Endolithic infestation increased towards lower latitudes most likely as a response of greater light availability. Additionally, artificial beds of either 100% non-infested or infested biomimetic mussels were used to test whether infestation alters the temperature and humidity of the interstitial spaces within beds, and if mussels surrounded by infested mussels experience lower body temperatures than those surrounded by non-infested ones. Conditions within beds of infested mussels were significantly cooler and more humid than in non-infested beds and individuals in the centre of infested mussel beds experienced significantly lower body temperatures. Under a scenario of warming climate, endolithic infestation of mussel beds might thus represent an ecological advantage not only for M. galloprovincialis as a species but also for the associated communities.

T1  - Two African origins of naturalized brown mussel (Perna perna) in Brazil: past and present bioinvasions
AN  - 1899721375
AB  - Shipping has facilitated dispersion of exotic marine species, the genetic diversity of which may allow determination of their geographic origins. The economically important African brown mussel (Perna perna) is widely distributed along the southeastern and southern Brazilian coasts, and for which information on genetic diversity and origins is scarce. Five populations, along 2,500 km of Brazilian coast, were genetically characterized to test for homogeneity, verify haplotype and nucleotide diversity levels, and infer relationships among Brazilian and African P. perna. Mitochondrial COI gene sequences of 488 bp were obtained from 158 Brazilian P. perna, and from GenBank for other locations. The nuclear fragment rRNA18S-ITS1 was used as a species-specific marker. The five Brazilian locations were homogeneous, being composed of two mitochondrial haplogroups: haplogroup 1, with low genetic diversity, was linked to Tunisia, Morocco, and Mauritania, and haplogroup 2, with high genetic diversity, shared haplotypes with Brazil, Venezuela, western South Africa, Namibia and Angola. Haplotypes from southeastern Africa and from Oman were not found in Brazil. Patterns in genetic structure, diversity, and haplotype relationships of haplogroup 2 appear related to past trade routes between former African colonies and Brazil, whereas the low diversity of haplogroup 1 suggests more recent invasions.

T1  - Infection rates and prevalence of metazoan parasites of the non-native round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) in the Baltic Sea
AN  - 1879884626
AB  - Studies in the Baltic Sea have identified over 30 parasite taxa infecting the invasive round goby (Neogobius melanostomus (Pallas, 1814). In this study, we aimed at comparing parasite assemblages and infection rates (prevalence and intensity) in different populations across the invasive range in the Baltic Sea (Denmark, Lithuania, Estonia and Finland). Infection rates were 56-60% across all locations except Lithuania (28%). However, the parasite assemblages in the sampled populations were dissimilar, each location having unique parasites. In addition, many of the parasites were generalists commonly infecting native fish species. Based on the results of this study and those previously conducted in the Baltic Sea, the round goby has not retained parasites from its area of origin, but instead has been successively colonized by native generalist parasites. Although variable, overall parasite richness is still quite low around the Baltic compared to the native areas (34 vs 71 taxa, respectively). Also, prevalence and mean infection intensities in the Baltic Sea are significantly lower than in the native areas. Therefore, the invasion success of the round goby in the Baltic Sea can at least partly be attributed to enemy release, in this case shedding a significant proportion of their native parasite load.

T1  - Do alien species matter? Impacts of invasions in Indian freshwater systems and challenges in management
AN  - 2031696287
AB  - Alongside anthropogenic activities and habitat destruction, invasions are regarded as one of the most influential components of global change. India as a growing economy and rapidly developing nation has been constantly engaged in infrastructure development which consequently has led to depletion of natural resources and declining quality of habitats aquatic systems in particular. Invasions that have established from the introductions in past during the colonial era and recently spread species are great challenges that hamper survival of aquatic resources. As of 2015, 20 plants, one mollusc and 38 fishes are known to have naturalized in the Indian water bodies. Awareness on the invasive species along with detailed information on the ecosystem-wide impacts is essential for management.

T1  - Local distribution of native and invasive earthworms and effects on a native salamander
AN  - 1915752179
AB  - North America is home to both native and invasive earthworms acting as ecosystem engineers as they build burrows that can serve as habitat for other species or otherwise alter soil structure, affecting nutrient cycling and other ecosystem processes. Here I determine where and what earthworm species commonly occur in my study area, and compare effects of native and invasive earthworms on the common woodland salamander, Plethodon cinereus, in field surveys and laboratory experiments. The native earthworm Eisenoides carolinensis was the most common earthworm, followed by two invasive species Dendrobaena octaedra and Octolasion tyrtaeum. The presence of O. tyrtaeum was associated with a narrower O-horizon (i.e., organic layer in the soil). Using structural equation modeling to explore direct and indirect pathways of these three most common earthworm species on salamanders, I found O. tyrtaeum occurrence was negatively correlated with nighttime salamander counts, a proxy for total salamander numbers, mediated by negative effects on O-horizon depth and microinvertebrate numbers. In the laboratory, O. tyrtaeum and D. octaedra consumed more leaf litter per gram of earthworm per day than the native E. carolinensis. However, salamanders consumed earthworms and used burrows of all native and invasive species of earthworms similarly. The potential for negative indirect effects of the invasive earthworm O. tyrtaeum on P. cinereus was demonstrated both in the field and laboratory, highlighting that seemingly small differences between native and invasive ecosystem engineers have the potential to significantly alter the effects of these closely related native and invasive organisms.

T1  - Continued feeding on Diporeia by deepwater sculpin in Lake Huron
AN  - 1889311533
AB  - Monitoring changes in diets of fish is essential to understanding how food web dynamics respond to changes in native prey abundances. In the Great Lakes, Diporeia, a benthic macroinvertebrate and primary food of native benthivores, declined following the introduction of invasive Dreissena mussels and these changes were reflected in fish diets. We examined the diets of deepwater sculpin Myoxocephalus thompsonii collected in bottom trawls during 2010-2014 in the main basin of Lake Huron, and compared these results to an earlier diet study (2003-2005) to assess if their diets have continued to change after a prolonged period of Dreissena mussel invasion and declined Diporeia densities. Diporeia, Mysis, Bythotrephes, and Chironomidae were consumed regularly and other diet items included ostracods, copepods, sphaerid clams, and fish eggs. The prey-specific index of relative importance calculated for each prey group indicated that Mysis importance increased at shallow ([less than or equal to]55 m) and mid (64-73 m) depths, while Diporeia importance increased offshore ([greater than or equal to]82 m). The average number of Diporeia consumed per fish increased by 10.0% and Mysis decreased by 7.5%, while the frequency of occurrence of Diporeia and Mysis remained comparable between time periods. The weight of adult deepwater sculpin (80 mm and 100 mm TL bins) increased between time periods; however, the change in weight was only significant for the 80 mm TL group (p<0.01). Given the historical importance of Diporeia in the Great Lakes, the examination of deepwater sculpin diets provides unique insight into the trophic dynamics of the benthic community in Lake Huron.

T1  - Antagonistic effects of biological invasion and environmental warming on detritus processing in freshwater ecosystems
AN  - 1874630585
AB  - Global biodiversity is threatened by multiple anthropogenic stressors but little is known about the combined effects of environmental warming and invasive species on ecosystem functioning. We quantified thermal preferences and then compared leaf-litter processing rates at eight different temperatures (5.0-22.5 °C) by the invasive freshwater crustacean Dikerogammarus villosus and the Great Britain native Gammarus pulex at a range of body sizes. D. villosus preferred warmer temperatures but there was considerable overlap in the range of temperatures that the two species occupied during preference trials. When matched for size, G. pulex had a greater leaf shredding efficiency than D. villosus, suggesting that invasion and subsequent displacement of the native amphipod will result in reduced ecosystem functioning. However, D. villosus is an inherently larger species and interspecific variation in shredding was reduced when animals of a representative size range were compared. D. villosus shredding rates increased at a faster rate than G. pulex with increasing temperature suggesting that climate change may offset some of the reduction in function. D. villosus, but not G. pulex, showed evidence of an ability to select those temperatures at which its shredding rate was maximised, and the activation energy for shredding in D. villosus was more similar to predictions from metabolic theory. While per capita and mass-corrected shredding rates were lower in the invasive D. villosus than the native G. pulex, our study provides novel insights in to how the interactive effects of metabolic function, body size, behavioural thermoregulation, and density produce antagonistic effects between anthropogenic stressors.

T1  - Pelagic phytoplankton community change-points across nutrient gradients and in response to invasive mussels
AN  - 1868320688; PQ0004020995
AB  - 1. Phytoplankton communities can experience nonlinear responses to changing nutrient concentrations, but the nature of species shifts within phytoplankton is not well understood and few studies have explored responses of pelagic assemblages in large lakes. 2. Using pelagic phytoplankton data from the Great Lakes, we assessed phytoplankton assemblage change-point responses to nutrients and invasive Dreissena, characterising community responses in a multi-stressor environment and determine whether species responses to in situ nutrients can be approximated from nutrient loading. 3. We demonstrate assemblage shifts in phytoplankton communities along major stressor gradients, particularly prominent in spring assemblages, providing insight into community thresholds at the lower end of the phosphorus gradient and species-stressor responses in a multi-stressor environment. We show that responses to water nutrient concentrations could not be estimated from large-scale nutrient loading data likely due to lake-specific retention time and long-term accumulation of nutrients. 4. These findings highlight the potential for significant accumulation of nitrates in ultra-oligotrophic systems, nonlinear responses of phytoplankton at nutrient concentrations relevant to current water quality standards and system-specific (e.g. lake or ecozone) differences in phytoplankton responses likely due to differences in nutrient co-limitation and effects of dreissenids.

T1  - Pelagic phytoplankton community change-points across nutrient gradients and in response to invasive mussels
AN  - 1857035693
AB  - Summary

              
Phytoplankton communities can experience nonlinear responses to changing nutrient concentrations, but the nature of species shifts within phytoplankton is not well understood and few studies have explored responses of pelagic assemblages in large lakes.

              
Using pelagic phytoplankton data from the Great Lakes, we assessed phytoplankton assemblage change-point responses to nutrients and invasive Dreissena, characterising community responses in a multi-stressor environment and determine whether species responses to in situ nutrients can be approximated from nutrient loading.

              
We demonstrate assemblage shifts in phytoplankton communities along major stressor gradients, particularly prominent in spring assemblages, providing insight into community thresholds at the lower end of the phosphorus gradient and species-stressor responses in a multi-stressor environment. We show that responses to water nutrient concentrations could not be estimated from large-scale nutrient loading data likely due to lake-specific retention time and long-term accumulation of nutrients.

              
These findings highlight the potential for significant accumulation of nitrates in ultra-oligotrophic systems, nonlinear responses of phytoplankton at nutrient concentrations relevant to current water quality standards and system-specific (e.g. lake or ecozone) differences in phytoplankton responses likely due to differences in nutrient co-limitation and effects of dreissenids.

T1  - Predation and Prey Selectivity by Nonnative Catfish on Migrating Alosines in an Atlantic Slope Estuary
AN  - 2333548362
AB  - Native to the central USA, the Blue Catfish Ictalurus furcatus and the Flathead Catfish Pylodictis olivaris have been widely introduced into many Atlantic slope rivers and are now found in several drainages of the Chesapeake Bay. Fisheries managers are concerned that these large, long‐lived catfish species may be contributing to observed declines in anadromous species, such as the American Shad Alosa sapidissima, Blueback Herring A. aestivalis, and Alewife A. pseudoharengus, all of which once comprised major U.S. fisheries. We assessed spatiotemporal variability and selectivity in the diets of Blue Catfish and Flathead Catfish during the spawning migration of these alosines. Catfish stomachs were collected during March–May in nontidal freshwater, tidal freshwater, oligohaline, and mesohaline portions of the James River. Diet contents were extracted from 2,495 catfish, 69.86% of which had prey items present in their foreguts (N = 1,743). We used DNA barcoding to identify degraded fish prey; nearly 30 taxa that would have otherwise gone undetected were identified in this manner. Blue Catfish had broad, omnivorous diets, whereas Flathead Catfish fed solely on other fish. Alosines were found in 4.46% of Blue Catfish stomachs and 16.67% of Flathead Catfish stomachs. Flathead Catfish selectively preyed on American Shad and, to a lesser degree, river herring. Alosines were consumed more frequently in nontidal freshwater areas, particularly in the high‐gradient reach between Bosher Dam and the 14th Street Bridge, and predation on alosines peaked in April. Our results suggest that Flathead Catfish are likely to have a greater per capita impact on depleted alosines. Furthermore, dams and other obstacles to fish movement may increase alosines’ vulnerability to predation by large catfish.

T1  - Cyanobacterial Toxins of the Laurentian Great Lakes, Their Toxicological Effects, and Numerical Limits in Drinking Water
AN  - 2108556525
AB  - Cyanobacteria are ubiquitous phototrophic bacteria that inhabit diverse environments across the planet. Seasonally, they dominate many eutrophic lakes impacted by excess nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) forming dense accumulations of biomass known as cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms or cyanoHABs. Their dominance in eutrophic lakes is attributed to a variety of unique adaptations including N and P concentrating mechanisms, N2 fixation, colony formation that inhibits predation, vertical movement via gas vesicles, and the production of toxic or otherwise bioactive molecules. While some of these molecules have been explored for their medicinal benefits, others are potent toxins harmful to humans, animals, and other wildlife known as cyanotoxins. In humans these cyanotoxins affect various tissues, including the liver, central and peripheral nervous system, kidneys, and reproductive organs among others. They induce acute effects at low doses in the parts-per-billion range and some are tumor promoters linked to chronic diseases such as liver and colorectal cancer. The occurrence of cyanoHABs and cyanotoxins in lakes presents challenges for maintaining safe recreational aquatic environments and the production of potable drinking water. CyanoHABs are a growing problem in the North American (Laurentian) Great Lakes basin. This review summarizes information on the occurrence of cyanoHABs in the Great Lakes, toxicological effects of cyanotoxins, and appropriate numerical limits on cyanotoxins in finished drinking water.

T1  - Accumulation of Microcystin (LR, RR and YR) in Three Freshwater Bivalves in <i>Microcystis aeruginosa</i> Bloom Using Dual Isotope Tracer
AN  - 2108419374
AB  - Abstract: Stable isotope tracers were first applied to evaluate the Microcystis cell assimilation efficiency of Sinanodonta bivalves, since the past identification method has been limited to tracking the changes of each chl-a, clearity, and nutrient. The toxicity profile and accumulation of MC-LR, -RR and -YR in different organs (foot and digestive organs) from the three filter-feeders (Sinanodonta woodina, Sinanodonta arcaeformis, and Unio douglasiae) were assessed under the condition of toxigenic cyanobacteria (Microcystis aeruginosa) blooms through an in situ pond experiment using 13C and 15N dual isotope tracers. Chl-a concentration in the manipulated pond was dramatically decreased after the beginning of the second day, ranging from 217.5 to 15.6 μg·L−1. The highest amount of MCs was incorporated into muscle and gland tissues in U. douglasiae during the study period, at nearly 2 or 3 times higher than in S.woodiana and S. arcaeformis. In addition, the incorporated 13C and 15N atom % in the U. douglasiae bivalve showed lower values than in other bivalves. The results demonstrate that U. douglasiae has less capacity to assimilate toxic cyanobacteria derived from diet. However, the incorporated 13C and 15N atom % of S. arcaeformis showed a larger feeding capacity than U. douglasiae and S. wodiana. Our results therefore also indicate that S. arcaeformis can eliminate the toxin more rapidly than U. douglasiae, having a larger detoxification capacity.

T1  - To what extend the dam dredging can influence the background level of metals in the Rhine River: using chemical and biological long-term monitoring to answer
AN  - 2056756943
AB  - Dredging generates remobilisation of sediments contaminated by non-degradable compounds such as metals, to which aquatic organisms can be exposed. This study aims at assessing the environmental impact of sediments remobilised in the Rhine River (France) during the dredging of Marckolsheim dam by pumping/dilution in 2013 on metal speciation and organisms' exposure. The monitoring coupling chemical and biological tools was performed 2 years before dredging operation on 2 sampling sites, upstream and downstream from the discharge of pumping/dilution, to acquire data on the natural variability of labile (DGT as passive samplers), dissolved and particulate concentrations of Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Mn, Pb and Zn in Rhine during full hydrological cycles. In parallel, size-calibrated zebra mussels were transplanted at both sites to monitor continuously metal bioavailability from particulate and dissolved fractions. This long-term monitoring allowed the establishment of reference baselines of Rhine water and mussels' contamination levels and subsequently, the detection of averred environmental changes due to the dredging. Indeed, Co and Mn accumulations in mussels exposed to the discharge were consistent with increasing labile species in Rhine whereas ones of Cr and Pb were likely due to an enhanced particulate bioavailability. Whatever the exposure route, the mussels recovered their basal metal contents 2 weeks after the end of dredging, suggesting a transient impact of sediment remobilisation on bioaccumulation. This long-term monitoring highlights the interest of coupling chemical and biological time-integrated tools for a better assessment of environmental risks because metallic exchanges between organisms and their media are complex and metal-specific.
Une opération de dragage engendre la remobilisation de sédiments contaminés par des composés non dégradables tels que les métaux, auxquels les organismes aquatiques peuvent être exposés. Cette étude vise à évaluer l'impact environnemental de la remobilisation de sédiments chargés en métaux dans le Rhin lors du dragage du barrage de Marckolsheim par pompage/dilution en 2013 sur la spéciation et l'exposition des organismes aux métaux. La surveillance chimique et biologique a été effectuée 2 ans avant l'opération de dragage sur 2 sites d'échantillonnage, en amont et en aval de la zone de rejet, pour acquérir des données sur l'évolution naturelle des concentrations labiles, dissoute et particulaires en Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Mn, Pb et en Zn dans le Rhin pendant des cycles hydrologiques complets. En parallèle, des moules zébrées calibrées ont été transplantées sur les deux sites pour surveiller la biodisponibilité particulaire et dissoute des métaux. Cette surveillance à long terme a permis d'établir des niveaux de contamination de référence du Rhin et des moules, et ainsi de détecter des changements environnementaux dus au dragage. En effet, les accumulations de Co et de Mn dans les moules exposées au rejet concordaient avec l'augmentation de leurs formes labiles dans l'eau du Rhin alors que celles de Cr et Pb étaient probablement liées à une biodisponibilité particulaire favorisée par la remobilisation de sédiments. Quelle que soit la voie d'exposition, les moules ont récupéré leur teneur basale en métaux 2 semaines après la fin du dragage, suggérant un impact transitoire de la remobilisation des sédiments sur la bioaccumulation. Cette surveillance à long terme met aussi en évidence l'intérêt de coupler des outils chimiques et biologiques pour une meilleure évaluation des risques environnementaux car les échanges métalliques entre les organismes et leurs milieux sont complexes et dépendent du métal considéré.

T1  - Salt Marsh Denitrification Provides a Significant Nitrogen Sink in Barnegat Bay, New Jersey
AN  - 1977164265
AB  - Denitrification in salt marshes can be an important removal mechanism for inorganic nitrogen, particularly in coastal estuaries subject to high nutrient loading and eutrophication. Barnegat Bay, New Jersey has had high nutrient loading in the northern part of the Bay and has exhibited symptoms of eutrophication. The first goal of this study was to examine seasonal denitrification, other N fluxes, and sediment oxygen demand in salt marshes of Barnegat Bay where inputs and concentrations of nutrients vary spatially within the Bay. Second, differences in N process rates among emergent vegetated marsh and permanently flooded isolated ponds were investigated. Finally, the percentage of the N load to the Bay removed by denitrification in the salt marshes of Barnegat Bay was calculated. It was hypothesized that denitrification rates would be the highest in summer and depend on water-column nutrient concentration. In addition, denitrification rate would be higher in vegetated marsh than in inundated ponds because of the aerobic/anaerobic interfaces present in marshes required by coupled nitrification-denitrification. Denitrification rate was three times greater in July than in October (p < 0.05). There were significant differences among marshes in N fluxes related to local availability of nutrients in the water column. Denitrification rates in vegetated marsh on thin sediment layers were more variable than in ponds. Overall, denitrification removed an average of 27.9% ± 6.9% of the total N load transported to the Bay, highlighting the important ecosystem service that the marshes provide to the Bay.

T1  - Competition between similar invasive species: modeling invasional interference across a landscape
AN  - 1881680588
AB  - As the number of biological invasions increases, interactions between different invasive species will become increasingly important. Several studies have examined facilitative invader-invader interactions, potentially leading to invasional meltdown. However, if invader interactions are negative, invasional interference may lead to lower invader abundance and spread. To explore this possibility, we develop models of two competing invaders. A landscape simulation model examines the patterns created by two such species invading into the same region. We then apply the model to a case study of Carduus nutans L. and C. acanthoides L., two economically important invasive weeds that exhibit a spatially segregated distribution in central Pennsylvania, USA. The results of these spatially-explicit models are generally consistent with the results of classic Lotka-Volterra competition models, with widespread coexistence predicted if interspecific effects are weaker than intraspecific effects for both species. However, spatial segregation of the two species (with lower net densities and no further spread) may arise, particularly when interspecific competition is stronger than intraspecific competition. A moving area of overlap may result when one species is a superior competitor. In the Carduus system, our model suggests that invasional interference will lead to lower levels of each species when together, but a similar net level of thistle invasion due to the similarity of intra- and interspecific competition. Thus, invasional interference may have important implications for the distribution and management of invasive species.

T1  - Population density, habitat dynamic and aerial survival of relict cave bivalves from genus Congeria in the Dinaric karst
AN  - 1878389089
AB  - Caves are some of the least-known ecosystems on Earth and long-term ecological studies and population size estimates are very rare. Genus Congeria is a Tertiary relict that comprises three species from Dinaric karst area; C. kusceri, C. jalzici and C. mulaomerovici, each with very limited distribution. They are the only known cave bivalves and in contrast to many other cave species, they form populations with high densities. We estimated that the population of C. kusceri in Jama u Predolcu is between 72,454 and 72,906 individuals. The highest density occurred between one and three meters depth, and reached maximum of 1,625 individuals per square meter. Here we also present the results of a two-year water temperature and water level survey in several C. kusceri and C. jalzici localities. Data loggers showed that C. jalzici occurs in colder caves and higher water level oscillations then C. kusceri. From our data, it is obvious that the natural hydrological conditions in Congeria habitats were seriously altered. This and a series of other threats led to Congeria species being highly endangered. During low water levels, a part of the bivalve population becomes exposed to air in most localities. Uniquely, they are active during that period and are able to survive those conditions for more than 2 months.

T1  - Algal flux affects the clearance rates of recently metamorphosed freshwater mussels
AN  - 1865259087
AB  - Despite their role as ecosystem engineers, which is in large part a consequence of their suspension feeding activities, the early life history of unionid mussels is not well understood. We examined the suspension feeding rates (i.e., clearance rates, CR) of recently metamorphosed juvenile Lampsilis siliquoidea (1-4 week old), Lampsilis fasciola (1-3 week old), Villosa iris (2 week old), and Ligumia nasuta (1 week old) under ecologically relevant flux conditions in a recirculating racetrack flow chamber system. The range of velocities examined was determined experimentally using a permeameter containing riverbed material (63 [mu]m to 6.5 cm diameter) in which juvenile mussels are thought to reside. The CR of the juvenile unionid species increased linearly with algal flux and the ranking of CR among species was V. iris > L. siliquoidea > L. nasuta > L. fasciola. CR also increased with the age (or size) of the mussel cohort but within a species CR increased non-linearly with shell length of the individual. These results provide new insight into the feeding abilities of recently metamorphosed juvenile mussels as well as potential threats to their growth and survival, which contributes to our understanding of their habitat requirements and may assist in the conservation of this imperiled taxon.

T1  - Invasive crayfish impacts on native fish diet and growth vary with fish life stage
AN  - 1865258548
AB  - Assessing the impacts of invasive organisms is a major challenge in ecology. Some widespread invasive species such as crayfish are potential competitors and reciprocal predators of ecologically and recreationally important native fish species. Here, we examine the effects of signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) on the growth, diet, and trophic position of the chub (Squalius cephalus) in four rivers in Britain. Growth rates of 0+ chub were typically lower in sympatric populations with signal crayfish compared with allopatric populations, and this effect could be traced through to 2+ chub in one river. However, growth rates of older chub (5+ to 6+) were typically higher in the presence of crayfish. Sympatry with crayfish resulted in lower chub length-at-age and mass-at-age in half of the rivers sampled, with no change detected in the other rivers. Stable isotope analyses (δ13C and δ15N) revealed that both chub and crayfish were omnivorous, feeding at multiple trophic levels and occupying similar trophic positions. We found some evidence that chub trophic position was greater at invaded sites on one river, with no difference detected on a second river. Mixing models suggested crayfish were important food items for both small and large chub at invaded sites. This study provides evidence that invasive species can have both positive and negative effects on different life stages of a native species, with the net impact likely to depend on responses at the population level.

T1  - Testing hypotheses on the origin and dispersion of Limnoperna fortunei (Bivalvia, Mytilidae) in the Iguassu River (Paraná, Brazil): molecular markers in larvae and adults
AN  - 1855687164
AB  - The invasive bivalve Limnoperna fortunei (Dunker 1857) was introduced in South America in 1991, with the first occurrence in Brazil in 1998. In the Iguassu River, the species was recorded in 2001; however, it is unknown how it was introduced and spread. Adults and larvae were sampled in Iguassu and Paraná Rivers, and the genetic profiles were compared. The species was absent in the upper reaches and only larvae were found, in low densities, in intermediary reaches. The L. fortunei populations from the lower Iguassu River presented no genetic differentiation among themselves, suggesting strong connectivity, and were significantly different from the Paraná River populations, most likely because of Iguassu Falls. Furthermore, the results suggest that the Paraná River represents the source of propagules to the Iguassu River. Generally, no significant differences were observed between the genetic structure inferred from adults and larvae. Only the population from the Iguassu National Park, a lotic environment, differed from the remaining subpopulations. The characterization of genetic profile using larval stages of L. fortunei populations was satisfactory, and represents an important protocol for studying the population genetics of aquatic species with planktonic larval stages.

T1  - Spatiotemporal trends for exotic species in French freshwater ecosystems: where are we now?
AN  - 1840991622
AB  - We compiled a list of 148 exotic species in French inland freshwaters, comprising 36 plant species and 112 animals, including 50 invertebrates, 7 amphibians, 1 reptile, 25 fish, 22 birds and 7 mammals. Spatial distribution maps and cumulative analyses for most species indicate that exotic plants are distributed more along the west coast of France and, to a lesser extent, the Rhone basin, whereas exotic animals are clearly clumped in the north-east (Rhine Basin). The rate of introductions has increased exponentially over time. The most recent introductions (since 1992) have occurred in the Rhine Basin, from where they have then spread. Twenty-five species on our list are among the '100 worst invasive species of Europe' (DAISIE) and 11 among the worst in the world (IUCN), with six species included on both lists. The potential cumulative impact of exotic species tends to be heterogeneous across France, though the north-east appears to be more disturbed, especially by animal species. Additional research is needed on criteria for prioritising intervention measures that will help stakeholders make objective choices in the management of exotic species in aquatic ecosystems.

T1  - Response of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages to round (Neogobius melanostomus, Pallas 1814) and tubenose (Proterorhinus semilunaris, Heckel 1837) goby predation pressure
AN  - 1840991604
AB  - One of the main assumed impacts of invasive gobies is predation on benthic macroinvertebrates. Despite numerous dietary studies, however, quantitative evaluations of impact in European river systems are scarce. Here, we investigate the impact of tubenose (Proterorhinus semilunaris, Heckel 1837) and round (Neogobius melanostomus, Pallas 1814) gobies on macroinvertebrates in a lowland river (River Dyje, Czech Republic) by allowing and preventing gobiid access to rip-rap substrate naturally colonised by invertebrates at two sites (Site 1--tubenose goby only, Site 2--tubenose and round gobies). Gobies had a negative impact on invertebrates at both sites, with overall invertebrate density reduced by 15% (ca. 17.9 g m-2 per year) at Site 1 and 36% (ca. 23.6 g m-2 per year) at Site 2. Both species showed increased impact in summer and ingested larger invertebrates preferentially, resulting in an overall reduction in invertebrate body size. Tubenose gobies had a significant impact on Annelida, Gastropoda, Crustacea and Ephemeroptera nymphs, while tubenose and round goby together impacted Annelida, Bivalvia (Dreissena), Gastropoda, Crustacea, Ephemeroptera nymphs, Odonata nymphs and Chironomidae larvae. Our results confirm that round and tubenose gobies can have a significant negative impact on aquatic invertebrate density and community composition.

T1  - Predator diet, origin or both? Factors determining responses of omnivorous amphipods to predation cues
AN  - 1840991557
AB  - Detection of chemical cues of predators and food resources is a key for the behaviour of many species in aquatic ecosystems. We checked whether predator origin and diet, containing potential food and/or alarm signals, affect the behaviour of omnivorous prey partly sharing their diet with a top predator. We conducted y-maze experiments to study the responses of invasive omnivorous and cannibalistic amphipods (Dikerogammarus villosus and Pontogammarus robustoides) to chemical cues of fish predators, injured amphipods and chironomid larvae (common amphipod food). As the predators, we used the goby Babka gymnotrachelus (sympatric with the amphipods) and piranha Pygocentrus nattereri (allopatric to the amphipods). The fish were either starved or fed amphipods or chironomids. D. villosus preferred predators fed chironomids and conspecifics as well as crushed conspecifics and chironomids, but avoided both hungry predators. Thus, D. villosus may perceive the presence of a top predator as an indication of both food resource and predation risk. P. robustoides avoided predators fed both amphipods (particularly conspecifics) and their alarm substances. The responses of both species depended more on the predator diet than on its species, which is likely to facilitate the recognition of allopatric predators and survival in newly invaded areas.

T1  - Trophic signatures of co-existing invasive and indigenous mussels: selective feeding or different metabolic pathways?
AN  - 1835917945
AB  - Species invasions can have profound ecological impacts, including changes in patterns of distribution, abundance and diversity of native species, altering food-web dynamics and ecosystem functioning. In the marine benthic environment temperature, predation, competition for space and wave action exposure are some of the main factors that determine invasion success; however, the importance of food availability for invasive species has been underestimated. The present study investigates the diets of two mussel species, Mytilus galloprovincialis and Perna perna, that occur in mixed-species mussel beds, using fatty acid (FA) and stable isotope (SI) approaches over two periods of time in 2012 and 2014. With the exception of one site, we found no significant differences in the SI signatures between species, while strong dissimilarities were present in their FA signatures. Both species showed signatures of exposure to good food quality, however, neither showed links to specific dietary trophic markers. The FA differences observed between species could be related to food selectivity by one or both species or more likely by different metabolic pathways. Further investigations are needed to clarify the pattern observed; however, the results suggested that the food environment was not an important factor in determining the success of the invasive species.

T1  - Spatially explicit risk assessment for coastal invaders under different management scenarios
AN  - 1834762928
AB  - Biological invasions are particularly challenging in marine environments, where control strategies are scarce and efforts to reduce the abundance of the invader are costly and difficult, often representing insurmountable challenges. However, the magnitude of the impact of the invasion depends not only on the characteristics of the invading species, but also on the inherent features of the receiving environment; managing the environmental matrix could therefore be the best option for preventing or reducing undesired effects. The objective of the present work was to develop a spatially explicit risk-based approach to evaluate the effectiveness of different management practices designed to mitigate the potential impacts of the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) in the Bahía Blanca estuary (38°50'S, 62°20'W). A Risk Index (RI) was constructed to assess the potential negative impact of oyster bed expansion on environmental values and human health. RI maps were built to compare the potential effects of different management options in terms of risk reduction. An integral sanitation program within the coastal zone produced the largest reduction in the areas previously ranked as under very low, low, medium, high, and very high risk. Treatment of domestic sewage produced a major reduction in the areas under high and medium risk, mainly in the inner zone of the estuary, but changes in the area under very high risk were negligible. Removal of oysters at specific locations had a modest effect on risk reduction in terms of the whole area, but produced significant improvements at a local scale.

T1  - The influence of the landscape structure within buffer zones, catchment land use and instream environmental variables on mollusc communities in a medium-sized lowland river
AN  - 1834759238
AB  - The world's freshwater molluscan fauna is facing unprecedented threats from habitat loss and degradation. Declines in native populations are mostly attributed to the human impact, which results in reduced water quality. The objectives of our survey were to analyse the structure of the mollusc communities in a medium-sized lowland river and to determine the most important environmental variables at different spatial scales, including landscape structure, catchment land use and instream environmental factors that influence their structure. Our survey showed that a medium-sized river, that flows through areas included in the European Ecological Natura 2000 Network Programme of protected sites, provides diverse instream habitats and niches that support 47 mollusc species including Unio crassus, a bivalve of Community interest, whose conservation requires the designation of a special conservation area under the Habitats Directive Natura 2000. This survey showed that mollusc communities are impacted by several environmental variables that act together at multiple scales. The landscape structure within buffer zones, catchment land use and instream environmental variables were all important and influenced the structure of mollusc communities. Therefore, they should all be taken into consideration in the future restoration of the river, future management projects and programmes for the conservation of biodiversity in running waters. The results of this study may be directly applicable for the rehabilitation of river ecosystems and are recommended to stakeholders in their future decision concerning landscape planning, monitoring species and their habitats, conservation plans and management in accordance with the requirements of sustainable development.

T1  - High Frequency Non-invasive (HFNI) Bio-Sensors As a Potential Tool for Marine Monitoring and Assessments
AN  - 2307430142
AB  - Marine ecosystems all over the globe are facing multiple simultaneous stressors including rapid climatic change and increased resource exploitation, such as fishing, petroleum exploration and shipping. The EU-funded DEVOTES project (DEVelopment Of innovative Tools for understanding marine biodiversity and assessing good Environmental Status) aims to better understand the relationships between pressures from human activities and climatic influences and their effects on marine ecosystems. To achieve these goals, it is necessary among others, to test and validate innovative monitoring tools to improve our understanding of ecosystem and biodiversity changes. This paper outlines the application of a high frequency non-invasive (HFNI) valvometer as a potential tool for long-term marine monitoring and assessments. The principle of the method is based on the regular gaping behaviour (closing and opening of the valves) of bivalve molluscs and the fact that physical or chemical stressors disrupt that gaping reference pattern. Bivalve gaping behaviour is monitored in the natural environment, remotely, continuously over a time period of years, requirements that must be fulfilled if bivalve behaviour is to be a useful biomonitoring tool. Here, we review the literature and highlight potential uses of the HFNI valvometry as a biosensor, to monitor and provide early-warning alerts of changes in water quality, such as global temperature increase, releases of contaminants and toxic algal blooms. Finally, potential relevant applications for monitoring and assessing environmental status of marine waters in the context of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive are identified. Relevant descriptors, Criteria and Indicators of Good Environmental Status that might be monitored using the HFNI valvometer are discussed for monitoring bathing beaches and harbours, petroleum installations and aquaculture sites.

T1  - Effect of starvation and subsequent feeding on glycogen concentration, behavior and mortality in the golden mussel Limnoperna fortunei (Dunker, 1857) (Bivalvia: Mytilidae)
AN  - 2417696613
AB  - The success of Limnoperna fortunei as an invasive species is related to its physiological plasticity that allows them to endure adverse environmental conditions. Starvation tolerance is considered to be an important trait associated with bivalve invasiveness. In natural ecosystems, food resources can vary during the year, exposing mussels to variable periods of starvation or limited food availability. Thus, mussels have developed physiological strategies to tolerate and survive fluctuations in food availability. Glycogen concentration has been used in different monitoring studies as an indicator of the nutritional condition of bivalves. The aim of this study was to investigate the physiological responses of L. fortunei based on the glycogen concentrations of specimens under four treatments, comprising different combinations of feeding and starvation, during 125 days. The experiment was carried out in two phases. In the phase I, mussels were divided in two treatments: starvation (S) and feeding (F). After 100 days, tissue samples were collected to quantify glycogen concentrations and, each phase I group was divided in two subgroups: starvation (S) and feeding (F), resulting in four treatments. In the phase II, that lasted 25 days, starvation specimens (S) from phase I were allowed to feed (starvation-feeding treatment , or S-F), or continued to undergo starvation (starvation-starvation treatment , or S-S) and the feeding specimens (F) continued feeding (feeding-feeding group, or F-F), or were subjected to starvation (feeding-starvation treatment , or F-S). Behavior (valve-closing) and mortality were recorded in 24 h intervals. After the 25 days (phase II) all specimens were killed, and their soft tissue was removed to quantify glycogen concentrations. The glycogen concentration of the S-F treatment was lower than that of the F-S treatment, which was initially allowed to feed (phase I) and then subjected to starvation (phase II). Stability in the glycogen concentrations was observed when the phase II feeding conditions were maintained during the experiments, as observed in the S-S (continued starvation) and F-F (continued feeding) treatments. Based on our glycogen concentrations results, the golden mussel shows a higher tolerance to starvation (125 days) than has previously been published, which suggests that its tolerance strongly influences its invasive behavior.

T1  - Cross-habitat effects shape the ecosystem consequences of co-invasion by a pelagic and a benthic consumer
AN  - 1819069341
AB  - Invasive species can have major impacts on ecosystems, yet little work has addressed the combined effects of multiple invaders that exploit different habitats. Two common invaders in aquatic systems are pelagic fishes and crayfishes. Pelagic-oriented fish effects are typically strong on the pelagic food web, whereas crayfish effects are strong on the benthic food web. Thus, co-invasion may generate strong ecological responses in both habitats. We tested the effects of co-invasion on experimental pond ecosystems using two widespread invasive species, one pelagic (western mosquitofish) and one benthic (red swamp crayfish). As expected, mosquitofish had strong effects on the pelagic food web, reducing the abundance of Daphnia and causing a strong trophic cascade (increase in phytoplankton). Crayfish had strong effects on the benthic food web, reducing the abundance of benthic filamentous algae. Yet, we also found evidence for important cross-habitat effects. Mosquitofish treatments reduced the biomass of benthic filamentous algae, and crayfish treatments increased Daphnia and phytoplankton abundance. Combined effects of mosquitofish and crayfish were primarily positively or negatively additive, and completely offsetting for some responses, including gross primary production (GPP). Though co-invasion did not affect GPP, it strongly shifted primary production from the benthos into the water column. Effects on snail abundance revealed an interaction; snail abundance decreased only in the presence of both invaders. These results suggest that cross-habitat effects of co-invaders may lead to a variety of ecological outcomes; some of which may be unpredictable based on an understanding of each invader alone.

T1  - Simulation of Terrigenous Minerogenic Particle Populations in Time and Space in Cayuga Lake, New York, in Response to Runoff Events
AN  - 1816808705
AB  - The important effects of minerogenic particles delivered from watersheds on optical and phosphorus metrics of lacustrine water quality have recently been quantified through measurements of the projected area of these particles per unit volume of water (PAVm), using an individual particle analysis technique. A mass balance type model for PAVm, partitioned according to the contributions of four size classes, is developed and tested for Cayuga Lake, New York, supported by long-term monitoring of PAVm in the lake and its primary tributaries. The model represents the source of PAVm of tributary inputs and three in-lake loss processes: (1) size-dependent settling, (2) enhancement of settling through aggregation, and (3) filter feeding by dreissenid mussels. The central roles of major runoff events and localized external loads of minerogenic sediment at one end of the lake in driving patterns of PAVm in time and space are successfully simulated, including (1) the higher PAVm levels in a shallow area ("shelf") adjoining these inputs, relative to pelagic waters, following runoff events; and (2) the positive dependence of the shelf increases on the magnitude of the event. Analyses conducted with the model establish that settling, with aggregation enhancement, dominates the loss of PAVm from the water column of the shelf, while mussel filtration increases in relative importance in pelagic waters. The utility of PAVm predictions to quantify the effects of these particles on optical and phosphorus concentration metrics of water quality is established.

T1  - Niche partitioning between invasive and native corixids (Hemiptera, Corixidae) in south-west Spain
AN  - 1814852743
AB  - Trichocorixa verticalis verticalis, a North American water boatman, is the only alien corixid in European fresh waters. It has rapidly spread, becoming the dominant corixid in and around the Doñana protected area in SW Spain. Its high abundance and similar morphology to native corixids suggest that T. verticalis may impact them through competition for food. Here we used stable isotopes of nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) and Bayesian analytical tools to investigate niche partitioning between T. verticalis and the native water boatman Sigara lateralis and Sigara scripta through a combination of experimental and field data. Species sampled from permanent ponds and laboratory aquaria could be separated based on their isotopic values (δ15N and δ13C). S. lateralis consistently showed higher δ15N values than T. verticalis, suggesting that the invasive species may be feeding at a lower trophic position and relying more on herbivory than its native competitors. This was particularly true for the T. verticalis nymph stage, which showed lower δ15N values compared to adults, indicating ontogenetic dietary shifts. In contrast, native corixids and the invasive species showed similar isotopic compositions in temporary habitats at different stages in the flooding-desiccation cycle, suggesting some degree of niche overlap and a slight reduction in trophic level for S. lateralis when inhabiting ephemeral systems. The combination of experimental and field data can help elucidate trophic interactions during a biological invasion. Stable isotopes provided insights into the trophic ecology of this invasive species and into the mechanisms facilitating co-existence with native species.

T1  - The status of the freshwater pearl mussel Margaritifera margaritifera in Scotland: extent of change since 1990s, threats and management implications
AN  - 1812699602
AB  - All known rivers in Scotland with recent records of freshwater pearl mussels Margaritifera margaritifera were surveyed in 2013-2015 using a standard methodology. Freshwater pearl mussel populations were classed as: (i) apparently extinct in 11 rivers, (ii) not successfully recruiting in 44 rivers, and (iii) evidence of recent successful recruitment in 71 rivers. On a regional basis, a high proportion of extant populations were located in North and West Scotland. In all regions extant populations were characterised by low pearl mussel densities, with 97 of 115 extant Scottish populations defined as 'rare' (0.1-0.9 mussels per 1 m 2) or 'scarce' (1.0-9.9 mussels per 1 m 2). Only 18 Scottish rivers now hold pearl mussel populations in densities that are considered to be 'common' (10-19.9 mussels per 1 m 2) or 'abundant' (>20 mussels per 1 m 2). Based on survey evidence, the number of apparently extinct pearl mussel populations in Scottish rivers is now 73. The decline is particularly pronounced in the West Highlands and Western Isles strongholds. The key threats are: (i) pearl fishing, (ii) low host fish densities, (iii) pollution/water quality, (iv) climate change and habitat loss, (v) hydrological management/river engineering and (vi) 'other factors', such as non-native invasive species. Over the last 100 years this endangered species has been lost from much of its former Holarctic range. Scotland's extant M. margaritifera populations continue to be of international importance, but their continued decline since the first national survey in 1998 is of great concern.

The biological control of invasive species has potential as an effective, safe and low-cost tool. The potential of using direct (clam consumption) and indirect approaches (predator-avoidance behaviour) to control the pest was evaluated, aiming at establishing a proof-of-principle regarding the suitability of such strategies in confined settings (e.g. pipelines, channels, raw water tanks and other water-dependent facilities). Invertebrate (Procambarus clarkii) and vertebrate (Lepomis gibbosus, Luciobarbus bocagei) predators were examined for their control potential. In feeding experiments, barbels foraged upon C. fluminea but ingested very few clams, and clam consumption by crayfish was only observed in the smallest size class (<1 cm). Additional experiments linked these results to the protective role of the clam's shell. In practical terms, the potential of the fish species as C. fluminea predators is limited, but crayfish can be important predators of small clams. In a second set of experiments, putative predator avoidance by clams was assessed in dual-choice aquaria. Refuge availability, predator diet and light conditions were taken into account. Clam avoidance was observed under particular conditions, but the amplitude of dislocation was limited.

T1  - The Application of Long-Lived Bivalve Sclerochronology in Environmental Baseline Monitoring
AN  - 2307430116
AB  - Assessments of the impact of construction, operation and removal of large infrastructures and other human activities on the marine environment are limited because they do not fully quantify the background baseline conditions and relevant scales of natural variability. Baselines as defined in Environmental Impact Assessments typically reflect the status of the environment and its variability drawn from published literature and augmented with some short term site specific characterization. Consequently, it can be difficult to determine whether a change in the environment subsequent to industrial activity is within or outside the range of natural background variability representative of an area over decades or centuries. An innovative approach that shows some promise in overcoming the limitations of traditional baseline monitoring methodology involves the analysis of shell material (sclerochronology) from molluscs living upon or within the seabed in potentially affected areas. Bivalves especially can be effective biomonitors of their environment over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. A rapidly expanding body of research has established that numerous characteristics of the environment can be reflected in morphological and geochemical properties of the carbonate shell material in bivalve shells, as well as in functional responses such as growth rates. In addition, the annual banding pattern in shells can provide an absolute chronometer of environmental variability and/or industrial effects. Further, some species of very long-lived bivalves can be crossdated back in time, like trees, by comparing the annual banding patterns in their shells. It is therefore feasible to develop extended timeseries of certain marine environmental variables that can provide important insights into long temporal scales of baseline variability. We review recent innovative work on the shell structure, morphology and geochemistry of bivalves and conclude that they have substantial potential for use as monitors of environmental variability and the effects of pollutants and disturbance.

T1  - Bridging the Gap between Policy and Science in Assessing the Health Status of Marine Ecosystems
AN  - 2307435358
AB  - Human activities, both established and emerging, increasingly affect the provision of marine ecosystem services that deliver societal and economic benefits. Monitoring the status of marine ecosystems and determining how human activities change their capacity to sustain benefits for society requires an evidence-based Integrated Ecosystem Assessment approach that incorporates knowledge of ecosystem functioning and services). Although there are diverse methods to assess the status of individual ecosystem components, none assesses the health of marine ecosystems holistically, integrating information from multiple ecosystem components. Similarly, while acknowledging the availability of several methods to measure single pressures and assess their impacts, evaluation of cumulative effects of multiple pressures remains scarce. Therefore, an integrative assessment requires us to first understand the response of marine ecosystems to human activities and their pressures and then develop innovative, cost-effective monitoring tools that enable collection of data to assess the health status of large marine areas. Conceptually, combining this knowledge of effective monitoring methods with cost-benefit analyses will help identify appropriate management measures to improve environmental status economically and efficiently. The European project DEVOTES (DEVelopment Of innovative Tools for understanding marine biodiversity and assessing good Environmental Status) specifically addressed these topics in order to support policy makers and managers in implementing the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive. Here, we synthesize our main innovative findings, placing these within the context of recent wider research, and identifying gaps and the major future challenges.

T1  - Further improvements in water quality of the Dutch Borderlakes: two types of clear states at different nutrient levels
AN  - 1816418937
AB  - The Borderlakes are a chain of ten shallow, largely artificial, interconnected lakes in the Netherlands. The ecological recovery of the central Borderlakes (viz. lake Veluwe and Wolderwijd) has been well documented. These lakes shifted from a eutrophic, Planktothrix dominated state in the 1970s to a clear state in 1996. Around 2010, the formerly hypertrophic, southern Borderlake Eem also reached a clear state, but at considerably higher nutrient levels. In this paper, monitoring data are used to compare these changes and identify the differences in driving processes and their consequences. The 1996 shift in Lake Veluwe was linked to increased fishery for benthivorous Bream, followed and stabilized by increase in Zebra Mussels and charophytes. Nutrients in Lake Eem decreased as well and Planktothrix disappeared here too in 1996, despite relatively high TP concentrations which remained stable over time. The start of the change into the clear state in this case also involved a decrease in the Bream population, but with a stronger additional role for dreissenids, particularly of Quagga Mussels. Remaining blooms of cyanobacteria almost disappeared, but the current situation in Lake Eem represents a different type of clear water state than in the central Borderlakes. This type is characterized by the combination of a relatively high phosphorus load, intense dreissenid filtration and filamentous macro-algae instead of either blooms of cyanobacteria or dominance of charophytes. With the dominant role of the River Eem, the relatively short residence time and increasing difficulty to bring down nutrient loading any further, the stability of this clear state depends on high densities (and filtration rates) of dreissenids.

T1  - How to combat cyanobacterial blooms: strategy toward preventive lake restoration and reactive control measures
AN  - 1816418885
AB  - Water managers worldwide are facing the serious problem of dense blooms of cyanobacteria in surface waters. In the quest for the optimal method to combat cyanobacterial dominance, many questions and many possible solutions arise. This paper presents a three-phase strategy to fight harmful cyanobacterial proliferation. Water managers who apply this strategy can generate a tailor-made set of measures. The three phases consist of (1) defining the ecological water quality targets of the waterbody in question, (2) assessing its current ecological state, and (3) selecting which measures will yield optimal results. The paper provides assistance in the quantitative diagnosis of the state of both shallow and deep temperate freshwater lakes by means of a lake system analysis, and presents a survey of measures. Measures are divided into two sets. Preventive measures are based on switching to a clear state (shallow lake) or reducing the overall cyanobacterial biomass (deep lake). They are subdivided into nutrient reduction, hydromorphological adjustments, and food web management. Concerning nutrient reduction, in many situations phosphorus management alone should suffice. Nitrogen management can be important to increase the species diversity of macrophytes, or to relieve downstream (marine) consequences. Control measures (including mitigation) have a direct impact on cyanobacterial blooms by biomass removal, flushing, or mixing; however, the number of proven technologies is limited.

T1  - Effect of an invasive filter-feeder on the zooplankton assemblage in a coastal lagoon
AN  - 1807632541
AB  - Depletion of phytoplankton biomass by the introduced reef-forming polychaete Ficopomatus enigmaticus has previously been observed in the Mar Chiquita lagoon (37°40'S 57°23'W; Argentina), but the effect of polychaetes on the higher trophic levels is still unknown. To evaluate the effect of this polychaete on the zooplankton assemblage, replicated mesocosm experiments (N = 10) were performed during spring, summer and winter. Mesocosms with reefs and without reefs were installed and grazing intensity and the effect on the zooplankton assemblage by the polychaetes were assessed. Our results show that the reefs of F. enigmaticus generate minor changes in overall composition of zooplankton assemblage. Although the structure of the zooplankton assemblage was different between seasons, the impact of the reefs was not significant in any of them. There was no relationship between the decline of food resource by grazing and changes in the structure of the zooplankton assemblage. Thus, contrary to our hypothesis, the grazing impact of the invasive polychaete on the biomass of primary producers did not generate cascading effects to higher trophic levels. However, changes in some components of the zooplankton assemblage (e.g. cladocerans) clearly show that the reefs of F. enigmaticus have the potential to affect the structure of the zooplankton community. The lack of data of community composition and abundance of zooplankton before the invasion limits the understanding of how this polychaete might have affected the structure and abundance of the zooplankton of this lagoon. Nevertheless this work suggests that these changes may not be so significant.

T1  - Major changes in CO2 efflux when shallow lakes shift from a turbid to a clear water state
AN  - 1801554664
AB  - Issue Title: Shallow Lakes in a Fast Changing World

              
Lakes can be sources or sinks of carbon, depending on local conditions. Recent studies have shown that the CO2 efflux increases when lakes recover from eutrophication, mainly as a result of a reduction in phytoplankton biomass, leading to less uptake of CO2 by producers. We hypothesised that lake restoration by removal of coarse fish (biomanipulation) or invasion of mussels would have a similar effect. We studied 14-22 year time series of five temperate Danish lakes and found profound effects on the calculated CO2 efflux of major shifts in ecosystem structure. In two lakes, where limited colonisation of submerged macrophytes occurred after biomanipulation or invasion of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha), the efflux increased significantly with decreasing phytoplankton chlorophyll a. In three lakes with major interannual variation in macrophyte abundance, the efflux declined with increasing macrophyte abundance in two of the lakes, while no relation to macrophytes or chlorophyll a was found in the third lake, likely due to high groundwater input to this lake. We conclude that clearing water through invasive mussels or lake restoration by biomanipulation may increase the CO2 efflux from lakes. However, if submerged macrophytes establish and form dense beds, the CO2 efflux may decline again.

T1  - A successful non-native predator, round goby, in the Baltic Sea: generalist feeding strategy, diverse diet and high prey consumption
AN  - 1800073324
AB  - The round goby Neogobius melanostomus has successfully invaded much of the Baltic Sea. However, very little is known about the feeding habits of the species in this newly invaded environment. Our laboratory experiment showed that the round goby is able to effectively consume a diverse variety of prey when given the choice between dominant benthic invertebrates: bivalves (Macoma balthica, Mytilus trossulus, Cerastoderma glaucum) and amphipods (Gammarus spp.). In contrast consumption of the gastropod (Theodoxus fluviatilis) was very low in all provided combinations. Nevertheless, the round goby had no statistically significant preference towards any of the prey taxa. The round goby exhibited size-specific consumption of M. trossulus, with smaller individuals being consumed at least 25% more than larger size classes. In addition elevated prey density resulted in higher consumption of prey by the fish. The broad diet suggests that shifting densities of benthic invertebrate prey has little influence on the further dispersal of the round goby in the Baltic Sea as the species is potentially able to switch between several native invertebrate taxa. This opportunistic feeding behaviour has likely favoured this invasion and ensured success of the species in the invaded ecosystem.

T1  - A primer on potential impacts, management priorities, and future directions for Elodea spp. in high latitude systems: learning from the Alaskan experience
AN  - 1800073316
AB  - Invasive species introductions in Arctic and Subarctic ecosystems are growing as climate change manifests and human activity increases in high latitudes. The aquatic plants of the genus Elodea are potential invaders to Arctic and Subarctic ecosystems circumpolar and at least one species is already established in Alaska, USA. To illustrate the problems of preventing, eradicating, containing, and mitigating aquatic, invasive plants in Arctic and Subarctic ecosystems, we review the invasion dynamics of Elodea and provide recommendations for research and management efforts in Alaska. Foremost, we conclude the remoteness of Arctic and Subarctic systems such as Alaska is no longer a protective attribute against invasions, as transportation pathways now reach throughout these regions. Rather, high costs of operating in remote Arctic and Subarctic systems hinders detection of infestations and limits eradication or mitigation, emphasizing management priorities of prevention and containment of aquatic plant invaders in Alaska and other Arctic and Subarctic systems.

T1  - The marine environment and ballast water management law
AN  - 1925589092
AB  - This article contains a study of international and national measures dealing with the potential threat of pollution and the introduction of alien species that may come from the discharge of improperly treated ballast water. Ballast water management policy, law and coastal biosecurity strategies are considered. There are challenges to achieving the ideals of ballast water laws, as correctly pointed out by President Denholm of the Baltic and International Maritime Council (BIMCO), such as the cost of achieving these measures in today's economic climate; however, this article emphasizes the long-term effects of ignoring proper ballast water management. This article encourages a sustained commitment to strategies aimed at dealing with pollution and the harm that may be caused by marine invasive species that often find their way around the world as a result of ballast water discharges. With the imminent implementation of international law on ballast water and a federal court of appeals in the United States ordering the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to rewrite a portion of its ballast water dumping rules, ballast water policy justly deserves unrelenting global attention.

T1  - Salinity as a barrier for ship hull-related dispersal and invasiveness of dreissenid and mytilid bivalves
AN  - 1808619393; PQ0003284779
AB  - The benthic stages of Dreissenidae and Mytilidae may be dispersed over long distances while attached to ship hulls. Alternatively, larvae may be transported by water currents and in the ballast and bilge water of ships and vessels. To gain insight into dispersal potential and habitat suitability, survival of the benthic stages of two invasive dreissenid species (Dreissena polymorpha and Mytilopsis leucophaeata) and one mytilid species (Mytilus edulis) chosen based on their occurrence in fresh, brackish and sea water, respectively, were tested in relation to salinity. They were exposed to various salinities in mesocosms during three long-term experiments at outdoor temperatures. Mussel survival was studied without prior acclimation, reflecting conditions experienced when attached to ship hulls while travelling along a salinity gradient from fresh or brackish water to sea water, or vice versa. Initially, mussels react to salinity shock by temporarily closing their valves, suspending ventilation and feeding. However, this cannot be maintained for long periods and adaptation to higher salinity must eventually occur. Bivalve survival was monitored till the last specimen of a test cohort died. The results of the experiments allowed us to distinguish favorable (f.: high tolerance) and unfavorable (u.: no or low tolerance) salinity ranges in practical salinity units (PSU) for each species, viz. for D. polymorpha 0.2-6.0 PSU (f.), 7.0-30.0 PSU (u.), for M. leucophaeata 0.2-17.5 PSU (f.), 20.0-30.0 PSU (u.) and for M. edulis 10.5-36.0 PSU (f.), 0.2-9.0 and 40 PSU (u.). At the unfavorable salinities, all mussels died within 14 days of initial exposure with the exception of M. edulis (23-30 days). The maximum duration of survival of single specimens of D. polymorpha was 318 days at a salinity of 3.2 PSU, of M. leucophaeata 781 days at 15.0 PSU and of M. edulis 1052 days at 15.0 PSU. The number of days survived was compared with the duration of actual ship voyages to estimate the real world survival potentials of species dependent of salinity changes, travel distances and durations. The conclusion is that salinity shocks during the trip were survived within the favorable salinity range but that the species tolerate only for a few weeks the unfavorable salinity range. This functions as a barrier for dispersal. However, at faster and more frequent shipping in the future salinity can become no longer very important as a dispersal barrier.

T1  - Can mussels be used as sentinel organisms for characterization of pollution in urban water systems?
AN  - 1802433640
AB  - Urbanization strongly impacts aquatic ecosystems by decreasing water quality
and altering water cycles. Today, much effort is put towards the restoration
and conservation of urban waterbodies to enhance ecosystem service provision,
leading to liveable and sustainable cities. To enable a sustainable
management of waterbodies, the quantification of the temporal and spatial
variability of pollution levels and biogeochemical processes is essential.
Stable isotopes have widely been used to identify sources of pollution in
ecosystems. For example, increased nitrogen levels in waterbodies are often
accompanied with a higher nitrogen stable isotope signature (δ15N), which can then be detected in higher trophic levels such as
mussels. The main aim of this study was to assess the suitability of nitrogen
stable isotopes as measured in mussels (Mytilus edulis), as an
indicator able to resolve spatial and temporal variability of nitrogen
pollution in an urban, tidally influenced estuary (Swan River estuary in
Western Australia). Nitrogen concentrations were generally low and nitrogen
stable isotope values of nitrate throughout the estuary were well within
natural values of uncontaminated groundwater, organic nitrate from soils, or
marine-derived sources, indicating groundwater inflow rather than pollution
by human activity was responsible for differences between sites. The δ15N signature in mussels was very stable over time within each site which
indicated that mussels can be used as time-integrated sentinel organisms in
urban systems. In addition, our study shows that the nature of the
relationship between δ15N in the mussels and the nitrate in the
water can provide insights into site-specific biogeochemical transformation
of nutrients. We suggest that mussels and other sentinel organisms can become
a robust tool for the detection and characterization of the dynamics of a
number of emerging anthropogenic pollutants of concern in urban water
systems.

T1  - Food algae for Lesser Flamingos: a stocktaking
AN  - 1790566412
AB  - Lesser Flamingo, the flagship species of saline wetlands of Africa and India, is a specialised feeder subsisting on microscopic cyanobacteria and algae. To establish the relationship between flamingo occurrence and food algal abundance and quality, an extensive microphyte survey in more than 150 sampling trips to seven countries over a 15-years period (2001-2015) was carried out. The 44 habitat sites included the core soda lakes in eastern Africa (Bogoria, Nakuru, Elmentaita, Oloidien), where the highest numbers of flamingos were observed, and five breeding sites in eastern and southern Africa as well as in north-western India. A reference describing the diversity of microphytes was established including members of three orders of cyanobacteria and nine orders of eukaryotic algae that potentially could act as food source for Lesser Flamingos. Preferred food organisms consisted of filamentous cyanobacteria, mainly Arthrospira, as well as benthic diatoms. Further investigation on the suitability of other microphytes as alternative flamingo diet revealed the food potential of chlorophytes and euglenophytes. This paper discusses a phycological perspective in the feeding ecology of Lesser Flamingos. The survey findings can assist scientists and conservationists in evaluating the potential of wetlands to support flocks of this endangered bird.

T1  - Human development modifies the functional composition of lake littoral invertebrate communities
AN  - 1790566387
AB  - Residential shoreline and watershed development by humans are leading agents of environmental change in lake ecosystems that reduce abundances and diversity of littoral invertebrates. Invertebrate functional and life history traits are robust indicators of environmental quality and ecosystem functioning, yet surprisingly few studies have utilized trait-based approaches to assess impacts of human development to lake littoral communities. We assessed environmental characteristics of human development that impact functional diversity and structure the trait composition of invertebrate communities in lakes of northwestern United States. Multiple linear regressions revealed that functional diversity declined with increasing watershed development, lake total phosphorus, and littoral macrophyte cover. Results from multivariate constrained ordination and fourth corner analysis indicated that high phosphorus concentrations and abundant macrophyte cover removed taxa with semivoltine life histories and filter feeders from lake communities, and that both regional ecosystem and local habitat characteristics of human development were important determinants of invertebrate community structure. Human development had particularly pronounced effects on invertebrate communities in the sublittoral zone, for which overall community abundances declined. Our study indicates that human development favors lake communities dominated by multivoltine taxa and herbivores, which may have important implications for energy flow among terrestrial, littoral, and pelagic food webs.

T1  - Consumption of the invasive New Zealand mud snail (Potamopyrgus antipodarum) by benthivorous predators in temperate lakes: a case study from Lithuania
AN  - 1790566378
AB  - Introduced species interact both directly and indirectly with native species. Of particular interest from the fisheries management point of view is how the invasive New Zealand mud snail, Potamopyrgus antipodarum, can alter the diet of fish and crayfish. If the snail is somewhat resistant to predation, it cannot be easily included into predators' diet. We examine the direct interactions between the introduced P. antipodarum and benthivorous predators local to temperate lakes through laboratory experiments and field surveys. Field survey showed that P. antipodarum dominated in the macroinvertebrate communities of the studied lakes. Feeding experiments indicated low consumption of P. antipodarum by most of its potential predators. Field diet survey showed that the main fish species did not significantly consume P. antipodarum. Moreover, it was ascertained that this snail can survive passing through the gastrointestinal tract of most studied fish species. Consequently, as local fish do not consume P. antipodarum, a part of lake primary production becomes locked in lower trophic levels. Therefore, there is a legitimate concern that the invasion of this snail may reduce the direct flow of primary production towards higher trophic levels in temperate lakes.

T1  - The invasive Chinese pond mussel Sinanodonta woodiana (Lea, 1834) as a host for native symbionts in European waters
AN  - 2417822327
AB  - Biological invasions are commonly observed in both the natural habitats and those which are altered by human activities. An understanding of the mechanisms involved in the successful introduction, establishment and invasion of exotic taxa is essential in predicting of changes in biodiversity and community structure. Symbiont-mediated interactions between exotic and native hosts are of special interest due to the indirect effects on population dynamics. The aim of this study was to estimate the presence of symbionts in Chinese pond mussel Sinanodonta woodiana (Lea, 1834), an exotic species of mussel in European fresh waters. The number of 340 individuals of S. woodiana was collected from Polish water bodies, including thermally heated lakes and fish ponds with natural thermal regime. The examination of mussels revealed the presence of Rhipidocotyle campanula sporocysts and cercariae (Digenea: Bucephalidae), water mites Unionicola ypsilophora (Acari: Hydracarina), oligochaetes Chaetogaster limnaei limnaei (Oligochaeta: Naididae) and chironomids Glyptotendipes sp. (Diptera: Chironomidae). The global prevalence of mussels inhabited by Ch. limnaei limnaei was 7.6%, by water mites and chironomids 3.5%, and by R. campanula cercariae 2.0%. The significant difference in the number of mussels with symbionts was identified between heated lakes and fish ponds (χ2=4.15; df=1, P=0.04), with a higher global prevalence of mussels in fish ponds (22.3%) compared to heated lakes (13.7%). R. campanula or U. ypsilophora were only found in mussels collected from thermally polluted lakes or fish ponds, respectively. Chironomid larvae and oligochaetes occurred in both types of water bodies. However, Glyptotendipes sp. inhabited mussels with a higher global prevalence in fish ponds than in thermally polluted lakes, while Ch. limnaei limnaei was observed mainly in hosts from heated lakes, and only from one fish pond that were not drained. Our findings indicate that the alien Chinese pond mussel S. woodiana can be inhabited by different groups of symbionts native to Europe, including digenetic trematodes. The results show that S. woodiana can affect directly and indirectly water habitats and the vulnerability of infection with symbionts depends on ecosystem conditions. It occurs that even considerable climate differences do not pose a barrier for exotic mussels to spread.

T1  - Effects of an invasive mussel, Arcuatula senhousia, on local benthic consumers: a laboratory ^sup 13^C-labeling study
AN  - 1791641265
AB  - Filter-feeding bivalves play an important ecological role in aquatic systems through benthic-pelagic coupling. However, the mechanisms by which invasive mussels influence the food uptake by local consumers are little known. We tested the interactive effects of the invasive mussel Arcuatula senhousia and the native clam Ruditapes decussatus on the uptake of 13C-enriched microalgae, Isochrysis sp., by two polychaetes, the surface deposit feeder Cirriformia tentaculata and the sub-surface deposit feeder Phylo foetida. Polychaetes were exposed to two different densities of A. senhousia and R. decussatus used alone or together. In each treatment, the 13C-concentration throughout the sediment horizon (0-0.5, 0.5-2.5 and 2.5-5 cm) was also quantified. Results showed that, irrespective of bivalve densities, the 13C-uptake by C. tentaculata was lower in the presence of the two bivalves together than in the presence of one bivalve species (either A. senhousia or R. decussatus). This was consistent with decreased 13C-concentrations in the 0-0.5 cm sediment layer in the treatment with the two bivalves together. Contrary to C. tentaculata, no changes were observed among treatments in the 13C-uptake by P. foetida. This possibly reflected a limited 13C-enrichment of the lower sediment layers. Our main findings are: (1) A. senhousia reduces the 13C-uptake by R. decussatus, and (2) A. senhousia reduces the availability of phytoplankton-derived C for deposit feeders by impairing the feeding, incorporation and bio-deposition of R. decussatus. We conclude that the interaction of A. senhousia with native bivalves needs to be taken into consideration in future food web studies.

T1  - Foraging differences between the native snail, Fossaria sp. and the invasive New Zealand mudsnail (Potamopyrgus antipodarum) in response to phosphorus limitation
AN  - 1790231451
AB  - Animals require food adequate in quantity and quality to grow and reproduce. Therefore, environments limited in key nutrients may promote competitive interactions, with the organisms best equipped to exploit these resources gaining a competitive advantage. We compared the foraging behavior of the New Zealand mudsnail (Potamopyrgus antipodarum), a worldwide invader that can dominate secondary productivity to Fossaria (Bakerlymnaea) bulimoides which is native to western North America to determine whether either of these animals modify their behavior to compensate for nutrient limitation. We used the amount of dietary phosphorus (P) as a measure of food quality, because P is often a limiting resource in freshwater ecosystems. We compared the feeding rate and food preference of each snail species to food containing two levels of P. Because potential competitors can also affect foraging decisions, we conducted additional experiments comparing the effects of conspecifics and heterospecifics under low and high biomass. Consistent with predictions, both species increased feeding rate of low P food, and P. antipodarum consumed more food per unit mass than Fossaria. However, only Fossaria displayed a preference for high P food. The two snails also differed in their response to interacting snails. Fossaria significantly reduced foraging activity in the presence of both conspecifics and heterospecifics, while P. antipodarum spent more time feeding under high conspecific density. Although the presence of high densities of P. antipodarum may negatively impact Fossaria in its native habitat, Fossaria's ability to locate and preferentially feed on higher quality resources may mitigate some of the impact, potentially facilitating coexistence between these two species.

Effects of excess loading of nutrients to the marine environment can be mitigated by mussel cultures, basically through nutrient removal from the marine environment when shellfish are harvested. Shellfish farming also provide other goods and services to the marine environment primarily through the impact on water transparency caused by shellfish filtration. There is an increasing awareness of the mitigation potential in mussel culture in relation to eutrophication, but so far practical examples of culture on full scale devoted to mitigation are few. Further, impact of mussel farming on nutrient cycling, e.g. in the sediments below the culture units, has raised concerns. In this review, we clarify concepts in relation to nutrient mitigation and discuss goods and services delivered by mussel mitigation cultures and their impact on an ecosystem scale based primarily on results from studies in heavily eutrofied estuaries. A multi-criteria approach for site selection is presented based on experiences from Danish waters, and economic aspects of mitigation cultures are analysed in relation to use of the produced mitigation mussels. Future perspectives for extractive cultures are discussed in relation to source of excess nutrients.

T1  - Origin and introduction history of self-sustaining rainbow trout populations in Europe as inferred from mitochondrial DNA and a Y-linked marker
AN  - 1774125164
AB  - Following its introduction in the late nineteenth century, rainbow trout gradually spread to become one of the most widespread non-native fishes. Nevertheless, despite continuous introductions, they have become self-sustaining in only a limited number of European rivers, most of which are located in the Prealps. There is no consensus on the reasons for the absence of self-sustaining populations over most of Europe, though genetic differences have been suggested as a potential underlying factor. We conducted a population genetic study of the structure and origin of European populations to help resolve these questions. We examined variation in mitochondrial D-loop and the Y-linked marker of 41 self-sustaining, stocked, and hatchery populations from Europe and compared them to native and hatchery populations in North America. High levels of genetic diversity but little inter-population genetic variation suggests that European populations are derived from multiple sources, with a great majority of parental populations belonging to steelhead and coastal rainbow trout from Central and Northern California. Our study revealed no considerable genetic differences among European self-sustaining, stocked, and hatchery populations. The mitochondrial DNA data do not allow evaluation of selection and adaptive traits and thus cannot explain potential population differences arising in their naturalization success.

T1  - Artificial hard substrate as a habitat for hard bottom benthic assemblages in the southern part of the Baltic Sea - a preliminary study
AN  - 1790263398
AB  - Benthic species associated with hard substrate are known to form communities characterized by high abundance and biomass. Although the bottom of the Southern Baltic Sea is dominated by soft sediments, such communities find favorable conditions to thrive on artificial substrates of offshore constructions. The aim of this research was to characterize both short-term and long-term benthic communities associated with artificial hard bottom provided by man-made structures in the Southern Baltic Sea. Species composition as well as the abundance and biomass were examined at various sites. An inactive World War II torpedo testing facility in the Gulf of Gdansk served as a site for sampling long-term communities while short-term communities were sampled using settlement panels and PVC cylinders. Panels were deployed at the torpedo testing facility for 127 days. PVC cylinders were deployed for 141-190 days in the Polish Exclusive Economic Zone. Twenty six macrofaunal taxa, including 12 crustaceans, were identified during the research. [Mytilus edulis] and [Amphibalanus improvisus] were the most abundant invertebrates at sampled surfaces. Six non-indigenous species were found. For the first time adult individuals of [Mytilopsis leucophaeata] were found in the Polish Marine Areas indicating that it is possible for this non-indigenous species to reproduce in this region.

T1  - Is Dikerogammarus villosus (Crustacea, Gammaridae) a 'killer shrimp' in the River Rhine system?
AN  - 1761207814
AB  - Communities and food web structures of aquatic ecosystems can be strongly affected by the establishment of alien macroinvertebrate species. In many European waters, the invasion of the Ponto-Caspian amphipod Dikerogammarus villosus has led to displacement of other macroinvertebrates. Predation by D. villosus is often assumed to be the key driver of the displacement based on results of laboratory studies, but this has not been verified in the field. Here, we report our investigation of the relevance of D. villosus predation in the River Rhine system using both stable isotope analyses of δ^sup 13^C and δ^sup 15^N, and molecular analyses of D. villosus gut contents with group-specific primers aiming at macroinvertebrate prey taxa. Stable isotope analyses of D. villosus from ten sites showed mean δ^sup 15^N values comparable to those of primary consumers. Overall, only approximately 1% of all tested primer/gut content combinations revealed DNA of the respective taxa. Both indicate minor importance of predation by D. villosus as a driver of the observed macroinvertebrate displacement. Conceivably, competitive strength due to opportunistic feeding, indicated by different niche widths between and a strong intraspecific variation of δ^sup 13^C values of D. villosus within sites of our study, is much more important for its invasion success.

T1  - Bivalve Grazing Can Shape Phytoplankton Communities
AN  - 2307426216
AB  - The ability of bivalve filter feeders to limit phytoplankton biomass in shallow waters is well-documented, but the role of bivalves in shaping phytoplankton communities is not. The coupled effect of bivalve grazing at the sediment-water interface and sinking of phytoplankton cells to that bottom filtration zone could influence the relative biomass of sinking (diatoms) and non-sinking phytoplankton. Simulations with a pseudo-2D numerical model showed that benthic filter feeding can interact with sinking to alter diatom:non-diatom ratios. Cases with the smallest proportion of diatom biomass were those with the fastest sinking speeds and strongest bivalve grazing rates. Hydrodynamics modulated the coupled sinking-grazing influence on phytoplankton communities. For example, in simulations with persistent stratification, the non-sinking forms accumulated in the surface layer away from bottom grazers while the sinking forms dropped out of the surface layer toward bottom grazers. Tidal-scale stratification also influenced vertical gradients of the two groups in opposite ways. The model was applied to Suisun Bay, a low-salinity habitat of the San Francisco Bay system that was transformed by the introduction of the exotic clam Potamocorbula amurensis. Simulation results for this Bay were similar to (but more muted than) those for generic habitats, indicating that P. amurensis grazing could have caused a disproportionate loss of diatoms after its introduction. Our model simulations suggest bivalve grazing affects both phytoplankton biomass and community composition in shallow waters. We view these results as hypotheses to be tested with experiments and more complex modeling approaches.

T1  - Using a Geospatial Model to Relate Fluvial Geomorphology to Macroinvertebrate Habitat in a Prairie River—Part 1: Genus-Level Relationships with Geomorphic Typologies
AN  - 2108710246
AB  - Modern river ecosystems undergo constant stress from disturbances such as bank stabilization, channelization, dams, and municipal, agricultural, and industrial water use. As these anthropogenic water requirements persist, more efficient methods of characterizing river reaches are essential. Benthic macroinvertebrates are helpful when evaluating fluvial health, because they are often the first group to react to contaminants that can then be transferred through them to other trophic levels. Hence, the purpose of this research is to use a geospatial model to differentiate instream macroinvertebrate habitats, and determine if the model is a viable method for stream evaluation. Through the use of ArcGIS and digital elevation models, the fluvial geomorphology of the Qu’Appelle River in Saskatchewan (SK) was assessed. Four geomorphological characteristics of the river were isolated (sinuosity, slope, fractal dimension, and stream width) and clustered through Principle Component Analysis (PCA), yielding sets of river reaches with similar geomorphological characteristics, called typologies. These typologies were mapped to form a geospatial model of the river. Macroinvertebrate data were aligned to the locations of the typologies, revealing several relationships with the fluvial geomorphology. A Kruskal-Wallis analysis and post hoc pairwise multiple comparisons were completed with the macroinvertebrate data to pinpoint significant genera, as related to the geospatial model.

T1  - Does narrow niche space in a 'cold-stenothermic' spring snail indicate high vulnerability to environmental change?
AN  - 1749553837
AB  - Niche breadth has fundamental ecological implications. Specialists with a narrow niche space are able to survive under specific conditions only, making them potentially sensitive to effects of environmental change. We here investigate (1) the factors restricting the specialized spring snail Bythinella dunkeri to its specific habitat, and (2) its capacity for plasticity to respond to changing environmental conditions, based on a combination of field work and laboratory experiments. By comparing occupied and unoccupied sites, we revealed that snail presence was most strongly affected by distance to the crop-out, water depth, pH value, and redox potential. In contrast, spring temperatures did not affect the occurrence of this 'stenothermic' snail, and laboratory experiments documented a high tolerance toward both high and fluctuating temperatures. However, B. dunkeri was found to be very sensitive to desiccation, such that changes in precipitation regimes may easily harm populations. The species investigated here may therefore indeed be sensitive to environmental change, but not because of limited thermal tolerance which initially seemed to be the most obvious reason.

T1  - Some Bryozoa species recently introduced into the Azores: reproductive strategies as a proxy for further spread
AN  - 2575269632
AB  - In the marine environment, control of invasive species’ population levels, that is, keeping them at an abundance level which is below a density-dependent adverse effect, may be the most attainable goal for the management of introduced bryozoans. An improved understanding of reproductive strategies and life history traits is key in order to understand the spreading potential. The assessment of the magnitude and temporal dynamics of propagule pressure from the reproducing population important for the success of control actions and needs is to be determined prior to any field intervention. The reproductive cycle of three fouling bryozoans (Bugula neritina, Tricellaria inopinata and Virididentula dentata) in the waters of the Azores Archipelago was assessed. The study revealed that although the release of larvae can occur throughout the entire year, its intensity and developmental and the attachment success of the ancestrula are not even throughout the year and that each species’ reproductive development needs to be determine independently. In the light of these findings, it is possible to determine the best time to apply field actions aimed at controlling invasive population’s density levels, optimizing the always scarce financial resources for marine management.

T1  - Further expansion of the invasive mussel <i>Sinanodonta woodiana</i> (Lea, 1834) in Poland – establishment of a new locality and population features
AN  - 2056768591
AB  - The increasingly frequent appearance of invasive species of mussels is a common phenomenon nowadays. Their rapid expansion is a significant component of the global changes that pose a great ecological impact and a serious threat to the diversity of native fauna. This study documents new localities of occurrence of Sinanodonta woodiana in Poland. We also attempted to determine its density, biomass, morphometric features and age structure. We found that its presence is clearly related to temperature and that the current range of its occurrence in Poland mostly overlaps with the areas with the highest average annual temperatures. The study showed significant differences in mean density between the fishponds: on particular sites the density amounted to 9 individuals/m2 and their biomass exceeded 3000 g/m2. ANOVA revealed significant differences in the mean dimensions of the shells between the three fishponds related to their height and width. Seven-year-old individuals were the most numerous while one-, two-, five- and six-year-old specimens were the most numerous in pond 2. In our opinion, S. woodiana has created a permanent population that is probably able to breed. This is confirmed by the appearance of one-year-old individuals as well as the other younger age classes.Alternate abstract:L'apparition de plus en plus fréquente d'espèces envahissantes de moules est un phénomène fréquent. Leur rapide expansion est une composante importante des changements globaux qui causent un fort impact écologique et une grave menace pour la diversité de la faune indigène. Cette étude documente de nouvelles localités d'implantation de Sinanodonta woodiana en Pologne. Nous avons également tenté de déterminer la densité, la biomasse, les caractéristiques morphométriques et la structure d'âge. Nous avons constaté que sa présence est clairement liée à la température et que la gamme actuelle de sa localisation en Pologne recouvre principalement les zones où les températures annuelles moyennes sont les plus élevées. L'étude a montré des différences significatives de la densité moyenne entre les étangs : sur des sites particuliers, la densité est élevée à 9 individus/m2 et la biomasse a dépassé 3000 g/m2. L'ANOVA a révélé des différences significatives dans les dimensions moyennes de hauteur et largeur des coquilles entre trois étangs. Des individus de sept ans étaient les plus nombreux en 1 alors que les spécimens de un, deux, cinq et six ans étaient les plus nombreux dans l'étang 2. À notre avis, S. woodiana a créé une population permanente qui est probablement en mesure de se reproduire. Ceci est confirmé par l'apparition d'individus âgés d'un an ainsi que la présence d'autres classes d'âge jeunes.

T1  - Search effort and imperfect detection: Influence on timed-search mussel (Bivalvia: Unionidae) surveys in Canadian rivers
AN  - 2056767300
AB  - Inventories and population monitoring are essential activities supporting the conservation of freshwater mussel diversity in Canadian rivers. Despite widespread use of timed-search methods to survey river mussels, the relationship between species detection and search effort has received limited study. In this study, repeat-sampling data from 54 Ontario river sites were used to estimate: (1) species detection probabilities; (2) the number of sampling events required to confidently detect species; and, (3) the power of timed-search surveys to detect future distribution declines. Mussels were collected using visual and tactile methods, and collection data were recorded separately for each 1.5 h of search time (up to 4.5 h). Thirteen species were collected; including two endangered species (Rainbow Villosa iris and Eastern Pondmussel Ligumia nasuta). In all cases, species detection was imperfect. However, detection probabilities (p) for most species were high (>0.69). Two repeat 4.5 h surveys are required to confidently assess whether most (83%) species are present at a site. Search effort had a positive effect on estimates of species richness, detection probability and site occupancy, and the power to detect future distribution declines. At all levels of sampling effort, detection probability and site occupancy estimates were positively correlated to mussel abundance.
Les inventaires et la surveillance de populations sont des activités essentielles pour soutenir la conservation de la diversité des moules d’eau douce dans les rivières canadiennes. Malgré l’utilisation généralisée de méthodes chronométrées pour étudier les moules de rivière, la relation entre la détection des espèces et l’effort de recherche a été peu étudiée. Dans cette étude, des données d’échantillonnage répété de 54 sites de rivière de l’Ontario ont été utilisées pour estimer : (1) les probabilités de détection de l’espèce; (2) le nombre d’événements d’échantillonnage requis pour détecter de façon fiable toute les espèces; et, (3) la puissance des échantillonnages chronométrés pour détecter de futures baisses de distribution. Les moules ont été recueillies à l’aide des méthodes visuelles et tactiles, et des données de collecte ont été enregistrées séparément pour chaque 1,5 h de temps de recherche (jusqu’à 4,5 h). On a récolté treize espèces; y compris deux espèces en voie de disparition (Rainbow Villosa iris and Eastern Pondmussel Ligumia nasuta). Dans tous les cas, la détection des espèces était imparfaite. Cependant, les probabilités de détection (p) pour la plupart des espèces étaient élevées (>0,69). Deux répétitions de 4,5 h de prospection sont nécessaires pour évaluer en toute confiance que la plupart (83 %) des espèces sont présentes sur un site. L’effort de recherche a eu un effet positif sur les estimations de la richesse en espèces, la probabilité de détection et de l’occupation du site, et le pouvoir de détecter les futures baisses de distribution. À tous les niveaux de l’effort d’échantillonnage, les estimations de probabilité de détection et d’occupation du site étaient positivement corrélées à l’abondance des moules.

T1  - Juvenile river herring habitat use and marine emigration trends: comparing populations
AN  - 1752873725
AB  - Juvenile habitat use and early life migratory behaviors of successfully recruited adult fish provide unique insight into critical habitats for a population, and this information allows restoration plans to be tailored to maximize benefits. Retrospective analysis of adult otolith chemistry combined with fish-otolith growth models were used to assess juvenile nursery habitat selection and size at egress to adult habitats (marine waters) for anadromous alewife and blueback herring from 20 rivers throughout the eastern US. Between-species differences in the size of emigrants were small, with blueback herring found in freshwater nurseries ~ 8 % more frequently than alewives, and alewives using a combination of freshwater and estuarine nurseries ~ 9 % more than bluebacks. Estuarine nursery use was more common in populations at lower latitudes. No clear trends in sizes of emigrants or habitat use were observed between the species in watersheds where both co-occur. Principal component analysis of latitude, watershed area, estuary area, accessible river kilometers, and percentage of the watershed in urban use indicated that the combined effects of these watershed characteristics were correlated with size at egress. These results highlight the considerable plasticity in early life habitat use among populations of anadromous fishes as well as the effect of watershed characteristics on early life migration timing and strategies.

T1  - Low Food Availability Narrows the Tolerance of the Copepod Eurytemora affinis to Salinity, but Not to Temperature
AN  - 1752556818
AB  - Invasive species perturb food webs, often decreasing resource availability for resident taxa. Low resource availability may interact with abiotic factors to restrict niches, particularly niche axes that influence metabolic demand. The San Francisco Estuary (SFE) provides a case study, as it has low phytoplankton concentrations, likely due to invasive bivalves. We conducted two laboratory experiments to examine how phytoplankton concentrations influence the salinity and temperature tolerance of Eurytemora affinis, an important prey taxon for threatened SFE fish. We found that decreased algal concentration narrowed the tolerance of E. affinis to salinity, but not to temperature. A third experiment revealed that when food concentration was relatively low (chlorophyll-a of 15 [mu]g L^sup -1^) and salinity was elevated (8 vs 4), E. affinis did not compensate for osmotic stress by increasing consumption, halving its growth rate. However, when algal concentration was elevated (chlorophyll-a 55 [mu]g L^sup -1^), E. affinis consumed three times more algae at a salinity of 8 vs 4, allowing copepods to grow equally at both salinities. Our interpretation is that while E. affinis can compensate for increased metabolic demand as temperature increases at low food concentrations, it can only compensate for elevated metabolic demand at hypo- or hyperosmotic salinities when food concentrations are high. We therefore propose the hypothesis that low food concentrations narrow the realized salinity, but not the realized thermal, niche of E. affinis.

T1  - Benthic algal response to invasive mussels in Saginaw Bay: a comparison of historical and recent data
AN  - 2018297352
AB  - Benthic algal communities in the Laurentian Great Lakes (USA and Canada) have been strongly affected by the invasion of dreissenid mussels. Early (1990-1995) studies in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron, demonstrated a shift from light to nutrient (phosphorus, P) limitation of benthic algae, and large changes in benthic algal community composition once zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) became established. We conducted benthic algal sampling and a nutrient enrichment experiment at a historic sampling site to quantify benthic algae under current environmental conditions and to compare current results with historical data. Benthic algal P-demand was apparently saturated immediately post-invasion, but in subsequent years, algal growth on artificial substrata was consistently P-limited (p always <0.005), perhaps as a result of declining mussel abundance. Epilithic benthic algal community composition displayed large interannual changes, perhaps in response to mussel-induced alteration of light availability and natural changes in substratum characteristics at this site.

T1  - Forecasting invasions: resource use by mussels informs invasion patterns along the South African coast
AN  - 1736889005
AB  - Issue Title: Topical Collection on Invasive Species: Guest Editors Elizabeta Briski and Farrah Chan (pp. 2447-2521)

              
 Invasive species are often more able to rapidly and efficiently utilise resources than natives, and comparing per capita resource use at different resource densities among invaders and trophically analogous natives could allow for reliable predictions of invasiveness. In South Africa, invasion by the Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis has transformed wave-exposed shores, negatively affecting native mussel species. Currently, South Africa is experiencing a second mussel invasion with the recent detection of the South American Semimytilus algosus. We tested per capita uptake of an algal resource by invading M. galloprovincialis, S. algosus, and the native Aulacomya atra at different algal concentrations and temperatures, representing the west and south coasts of South Africa, to examine whether their per capita resource use could be a predictor of their spread and subsequent invasiveness. Regardless of temperature, M. galloprovincialis was the most efficient consumer, significantly reducing algal cells compared to the other species when the resource was presented in both low and high starting densities. Furthermore, these findings aligned with a greater biomass of M. galloprovincialis on the shore in comparison with the other species. Resource use by the new invader S. algosus was dependent on the density of resource and, although this species was efficient at low algal concentrations at cooler temperatures, this pattern broke down at higher algal densities. This was once more reflected in lower biomass in surveys of this species along the cool west coast. We therefore forecast that S. algosus will be become established along the south coast; however, we also predict that M. galloprovincialis will maintain dominance on these shores.

T1  - DNA oxidation and DNA repair in gills of zebra mussels exposed to cadmium and benzo(a)pyrene
AN  - 1736628577
AB  - Freshwater bivalve molluscs are considered as effective indicators of environmental pollution. The comet assay allows the detection of DNA damage such as DNA strand breaks and alkali-labile sites. The main oxidative lesion, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG), which is a pre-mutagenic lesion, can be detected by the comet assay coupled with the hOGG1 DNA repair enzyme. With this modified assay we recently observed that BaP induced 8-oxodG lesions and with the modified comet-Fpg assay we observed that Cd induced oxidative DNA damage. The aim of this study was to determine the stability of DNA lesions in Cd and BaP exposed zebra mussels using the comet-hOGG1 assay. Mussels were exposed for 24 h to these two chemicals and then placed in clean water for 6 days. We observed that BaP (7, 12 and 18 µg/L) induced an increase of DNA strand break levels as soon as 6 h of exposure and that the two highest concentrations of BaP induced a low level of hOGG1-sensitive sites. After 2 days of depuration, BaP induced DNA lesions returned to the basal level, indicating an effective DNA repair. Cd (3, 32 and 81 µg/L) induced an increase of the DNA strand break levels and a low level of hOGG1-sensitive sites. This study revealed that BaP-induced DNA lesions are repaired more efficiently than Cd-induced DNA lesions. As the level of hOGG1 sensitive sites was increased in Cd and BaP exposed mussels, it seems that these chemicals induce 8-oxo-dG.

T1  - Structure and density population of the invasive mollusc Limnoperna fortunei associated with Eichhornia crassipes in lakes of the Middle Paraná floodplain
AN  - 2417701833
AB  - The roots of Eichhornia crassipes provide different microhabitats for invertebrates, including substrate for the Asian invasive bivalve Limnoperna fortunei. This work evaluated the density and size structure of L. fortunei on the roots of E. crassipes in lentic waterbodies associated with the Middle Paraná floodplain. The field work was carried out between November 2009–2010, covering different phases of the hydrological regime. Floating meadows of E. crassipes were sampled monthly in two lakes with different degrees of connection to the main channel of the Paraná River. Bivalve densities were not associated with variations of the biomass of E. crassipes roots and the highest mussel densities were recorded during months of high temperature. The maximum size recorded in both lakes corresponded to individuals approximately 2.5 years old; however, up to 75% of the molluscs were represented by pre-reproductive individuals (up to 6 months old). In these lakes with soft bottom and limited hard substrates, E. crassipes is an important site for the mussel attachment during its early stages of development and could not be the final site of settlement during its lifecycle.

AN  - 1788746998
AB  - Aim: Information on the influence of mussel macrofouling in invertebrate communities usually have the initial assumption of negative interference. Methods: We analyzed this relationship in a community of aquatic invertebrates associated to roots of Eichhornia crassipes in 15 shallow marginal lakes in the Pantanal National Park and surroundings. We sampled quadrants of floating vegetation, identified the aggregate fauna and evaluated the density effect of Limnoperna fortunei, as well as abiotic factors of the Trichoptera community using ordinances and multivariate regressions. Results: We found no significant relationship between the abundance of mussels on the macrophytes and the Trichoptera larvae. However, we observed an interference of oxygen on the structure and density of genera. The composition and abundance of the phytophylous caddisfly community is influenced by the depth and the concentration of oxygen dissolved in the marginal regions of the lakes. Conclusions: We suggest that the absence of the effects of the assessed L. fortunei in the community is related to the 'biotic resistance', in which the phytophylous caddisfly demonstrated adaptation to an environment characterized by hypoxic conditions in the dry season. L. fortunei was limited by the depth and reduction of oxygen, presenting lower density in lakes with such characteristics.

T1  - Diet analysis of burbot (Lota lota) from eastern Lake Michigan: 1996-2012

AB  - Issue Title: THEMED SECTION: Ecology, Culture, and Management of Burbot

              
Burbot (Lota lota) stomach content was analyzed from eastern Lake Michigan using 835 stomach samples collected from 1996 to 2012. Our results show alteration in the prey community consumed between the early study period (1996-2006) and the more recent period (2007-2012). In the early years, alewives (Alosa pseudoharengus), slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus), and mottled sculpin (C. bairdii) were the most important prey items, with regional variation suggesting greater use of Cottus spp. in the southern lake sites compared to northern sites where alewives were predominant. Non-native round gobies (Neogobius melanostomus) replaced Cottus spp. and alewives as the most frequently found prey item in the more recent years in the dataset, and other minor constituents of the prey assemblage nearly disappeared from the stomach samples. Round gobies first appeared in the diet in 1999 and became frequent by 2006, reaching 55.80% (±5.36) in 2012. The dominance of round goby as prey for burbot is important for the transfer of benthic nutrients into the upper food web in Lake Michigan. Our data highlight the striking food web shift linked to the non-native species invasion that has taken place in Lake Michigan since 2000 and emphasize its impact on native predator ecology.

T1  - Biophysical modeling assessment of the drivers for plankton dynamics in dreissenid-colonized western Lake Erie
AN  - 1732817199; PQ0002236705
AB  - Given that phytoplankton and zooplankton communities have served as key ecological indicators of anthropogenic and other perturbations, a high-resolution Finite Volume Coastal Ocean Model (FVCOM) based Integrated Compartment Model (FVCOM-ICM) was implemented to investigate plankton dynamics with the inclusion of dreissenid invasion in Lake Erie, particularly in the most productive western basin. After identifying suitable horizontal and vertical resolutions that allowed for accurate depiction of in-lake nutrient concentrations and plankton biomass, we explored how variation in nutrient (phosphorus, nitrogen) loading and dreissenid mussel density could influence plankton dynamics. Our scenario-testing showed that western Lake Erie's phytoplankton community appeared more limited by phosphorus than nitrogen on both seasonal and interannual scales with light limitation occurring in the nearshore and Maumee River plume areas. Dreissenid mussel impacts varied temporally, with phytoplankton communities being highly influenced by dreissenid nutrient excretion at times (under low nutrient availability) and dreissenid grazing at other times (under bloom conditions). It was concluded that the effect of zooplankton predation on phytoplankton was stronger than that of dreissenid mussels, and that multiple algal groups could promote the efficiency of nutrient assimilation and the overall plankton production. Additionally, river inputs and wind-driven water circulation were important by causing heterogeneity in habitat conditions through nutrient advection and vertical mixing, and wind-induced surface waves could result in non-negligible down-wind redistribution of plankton biomass, which increased with wind/wave magnitude.

T1  - A rapid method for constructing precaution maps based on a simple virtual ecology model: a case study on the range expansion of the invasive aquatic species Limnoperna fortunei
AN  - 1705644067
AB  - Before invasion, or in its early stages, information on the invader in target areas is generally extremely limited. In such situations, managers must select focal areas in which to concentrate control and mitigation efforts. Here, we discuss a rapid method for selecting areas in which to control invasive aquatic species based on limited information. We used a simple cellular automata model that does not require species-specific information, but simulates the process of invasive species expansion and includes observed expansion progress to detect keystone areas. As a case study, we simulated the expansion of an invasive aquatic mussel, Limnoperna fortunei, in Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan, and detected the areas in which control efforts should be concentrated. To some extent, our model was able to predict the expansion of L. fortunei from the initial detected invasion to the current distribution. We predicted areas with a high potential of spreading and areas that would suffer from high propagule pressure. Results revealed a mismatch between areas with high spread potential and those with high propagule pressure. Managers should concentrate their invasion prevention efforts in the former because these are likely to have a greater long-term influence. Additionally, we predicted future expansion from the current distribution and showed that current scattered populations could merge naturally. Our approach is useful for establishing a management plan before or in the early stages of invasion.

T1  - Spatial Ecology of Female Barbour's Map Turtles (Graptemys barbouri) in Ichawaynochaway Creek, Georgia
AN  - 1704733526
AB  - Quantifying patterns of habitat use by riverine species is logistically challenging, yet instream habitat characteristics are likely important in explaining the distribution of species. We integrated radiotelemetry and sonar habitat mapping to quantify instream habitat use by female Barbour's Map Turtles (Graptemys barbouri) in Ichawaynochaway Creek, a tributary to the Flint River. We used logistic regression and a Bayesian information-theoretic approach to evaluate habitat use relative to habitat availability based on random locations. Over the two-year study period, turtles used an average of 839±199 m of creek length and exhibited site fidelity (mean 50% kernel density = 0.23+0.05 ha). Substrate was generally more predictive of habitat use of female C. barbouri compared to large woody debris and water depth. Turtles generally used deeper habitats close to rocky-boulder and rocky-fine substrate with greater amounts of large woody debris. Estimates of home range size and habitat use found in this study improve our understanding of the spatial ecology of C. barbouri and provide a baseline for their habitat use in a relatively undisturbed section of stream. It is imperative to understand the spatial ecology of species, such as map turtles, that are particularly vulnerable to indirect effects of habitat modifications caused by impoundments, sedimentation, pollution, and snagging.

T1  - Greenhouses: hotspots in the invasive network for alien species
AN  - 1699060069
AB  - Though special nodes play an important role in spreading invasive species, most attempts have focused on modeling the invasive pathway. Few invasion hotspots, such as botanic gardens and greenhouses, as well as their roles in introducing alien species, have been investigated. There are some investigations about the importance of botanic gardens in the biological invasion process, but few centers on the same role that greenhouses play. This study pays more attention on the intermediate role of greenhouses in spreading alien species which can escape into neighboring habitats without appropriate supervision and management. The pest risk analysis and IPM should take greenhouses as a hotspot of invasive network, and more information on invasive species of greenhouse must be recorded and shared.

T1  - Freshwater bivalves rearing: a brief overview
AN  - 2623497613
AB  - Freshwater bivalves farming is principally focused on freshwater pearl production in Asia and conservation aquaculture in USA while in Europe is almost completely unknown. High larval mortality is considered the bottleneck in freshwater bivalve larval rearing and methods currently used in marine bivalve larval rearing can be transferred in freshwater mussels. It is likely that probiotics and aquatic microbiology will play a key role also in freshwater bivalves larval rearing. Alternative applications of freshwater mussel rearing should be studied in deep in the future as integrated productions, bioindication projects and utilization of freshwater mussel meal as potential source for fish feeds. The aim of this review is to give a description of potential applications for freshwater bivalve rearing and possible future perspectives.

T1  - Individuals in food webs: the relationships between trophic position, omnivory and among-individual diet variation
AN  - 1676447100
AB  - Issue Title: Special Feature on Individual-level niche specialization

              
Among-individual diet variation is common in natural populations and may occur at any trophic level within a food web. Yet, little is known about its variation among trophic levels and how such variation could affect phenotypic divergence within populations. In this study we investigate the relationships between trophic position (the population's range and average) and among-individual diet variation. We test for diet variation among individuals and across size classes of Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis), a widespread predatory freshwater fish that undergoes ontogenetic niche shifts. Second, we investigate among-individual diet variation within fish and invertebrate populations in two different lake communities using stable isotopes. Third, we test potential evolutionary implications of population trophic position by assessing the relationship between the proportion of piscivorous perch (populations of higher trophic position) and the degree of phenotypic divergence between littoral and pelagic perch sub-populations. We show that among-individual diet variation is highest at intermediate trophic positions, and that this high degree of among-individual variation likely causes an increase in the range of trophic positions among individuals. We also found that phenotypic divergence was negatively related to trophic position in a population. This study thus shows that trophic position is related to and may be important for among-individual diet variation as well as to phenotypic divergence within populations.

T1  - Invasive earthworms interact with abiotic conditions to influence the invasion of common buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica)
AN  - 1676447024
AB  - Issue Title: Special Feature on Individual-level niche specialization

              
Common buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica L.) is one of the most abundant and ecologically harmful non-native plants in forests of the Upper Midwest United States. At the same time, European earthworms are invading previously glaciated areas in this region, with largely anecdotal evidence suggesting they compound the negative effects of buckthorn and influence the invasibility of these forests. Germination and seedling establishment are important control points for colonization by any species, and manipulation of the conditions influencing these life history stages may provide insight into why invasive species are successful in some environments and not others. Using a greenhouse microcosm experiment, we examined the effects of important biotic and abiotic factors on the germination and seedling establishment of common buckthorn. We manipulated light levels, leaf litter depth and earthworm presence to investigate the independent and interactive effects of these treatments on buckthorn establishment. We found that light and leaf litter depth were significant predictors of buckthorn germination but that the presence of earthworms was the most important factor; earthworms interacted with light and leaf litter to increase the number and biomass of buckthorn across all treatments. Path analysis suggested both direct and moisture-mediated indirect mechanisms controlled these processes. The results suggest that the action of earthworms may provide a pathway through which buckthorn invades forests of the Upper Midwest United States. Hence, researchers and managers should consider co-invasion of plants and earthworms when investigating invasibility and creating preemptive or post-invasion management plans.

T1  - Ecosystem impacts of the widespread non-indigenous species in the Baltic Sea: literature survey evidences major limitations in knowledge
AN  - 1657499211
AB  - Issue Title: Emerging Trends in Aquatic Ecology

              
Invasion of non-indigenous species (NIS) is acknowledged as one of the most important external drivers affecting structure and functions of marine ecosystems globally. This paper offers literature-based analysis on the effects of the widespread (occurring in at least 50% of countries) and currently established NIS on ecosystem features in the Baltic Sea. It appears that out of the 18 NIS taxa studied, there are no published records on 28% of NIS for any of the seven impact categories investigated. When ecological impacts are known, laboratory experimental evidence dominates over field studies. Combined observations on impact strength, information type and confidence level suggest that the two benthic invertebrates, the polychaete Marenzelleria spp. and the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas 1771) exert the highest ecosystem impact. Despite continuously accumulating information on the NIS effects, however, the confidence of findings is still low. Thus, we still understand very little on both the direction and magnitude of the effects of even the most widespread NIS on the structure and dynamics of the Baltic Sea ecosystems. In order to increase reliability of such assessments, future research should be targeted towards spatially-explicit field surveys and experimenting of multitrophic systems, together with modelling of ecosystem impact.

T1  - Suitability of enzymatic markers to assess the environmental condition of natural populations of Gambusia affinis and Daphnia magna--a case study
AN  - 1674448672
AB  - In recent years, the use of biochemical markers, especially in the assessment of toxic effects and modes of action, under controlled laboratory conditions has increased. However, transposing their use to in situ monitoring or risk assessment evaluations has encountered barriers, mainly related to the difficulty in interpreting the meaning of biochemical variation. In this work, we aimed at understanding if biochemical marker activities (cholinesterase, glutathione S-transferase and lactate dehydrogenase) can be used to monitor the health status of natural populations of fish (Gambusia affinis) and daphnids (Daphnia magna). For that, two ponds with different water properties were chosen as study sites, and organisms collected at four sampling periods along the year. The pattern of biochemical marker responses was not the same in the two species, showing higher integrated biochemical marker response values in the winter for G. affinis and in the autumn for D. magna, suggesting specificities that must be taken into account in biomonitoring programmes by including representative species of several trophic levels. In the case of G. affinis, the differences in key physicochemical parameters between the two ponds (especially dissolved oxygen levels) did not seem to affect biochemical marker levels as if organisms were already perfectly adapted to their environment. In general, seasonal variation of water quality seems to have an important role on biochemical marker responses. Several parameters above Environmental Quality Standards were identified such as dissolved oxygen (DO), ammonia, nitrites, sulphides and metals, but eventual responses to these stressors could not be discriminated from natural variation except for particular cases.

T1  - Freshwater bivalves rearing: a brief overview
AN  - 1677311762
AB  - Freshwater bivalves farming is principally focused on freshwater pearl production in Asia and conservation aquaculture in USA while in Europe is almost completely unknown. High larval mortality is considered the bottleneck in freshwater bivalve larval rearing and methods currently used in marine bivalve larval rearing can be transferred in freshwater mussels. It is likely that probiotics and aquatic microbiology will play a key role also in freshwater bivalves larval rearing. Alternative applications of freshwater mussel rearing should be studied in deep in the future as integrated productions, bioindication projects and utilization of freshwater mussel meal as potential source for fish feeds. The aim of this review is to give a description of potential applications for freshwater bivalve rearing and possible future perspectives.

T1  - Ecosystem impacts of the invasive bivalve Limnoperna fortunei (golden mussel) in South America
AN  - 1646554179
AB  - Issue Title: Aquatic Invasive Species

              
We summarize current knowledge on the effects of the invasive Asian bivalve Limnoperna fortunei (introduced in South America around 1990) on local biota. Limnoperna modifies nutrient concentrations and decreases concentrations of particulate organic matter in the water column (including phytoplankton and zooplankton), thus enhancing light penetration and stimulating growth of periphyton and macrophytes. Selective grazing and modification of the N:P ratio are responsible for strong enhancements of toxic cyanobacterial blooms. Limnoperna beds significantly enhance the numbers, biomass, and diversity of practically all accompanying invertebrates. The mussel's planktonic larvae represent an important food item for the larvae of 18 fish species, while juveniles and adults are consumed by at least 50 fish species. Limnoperna is the first and only abundant benthic filter-feeding animal in South American continental waters. The fact that it intercepts and retains in the freshwater lotic domain particulate organic matter that would otherwise be swept into the sea must represent an important energetic subsidy, but the ecosystem-wide consequences of this trophic shift have not yet been addressed. Comparison with the impacts of the zebra mussel in Europe and North America suggests important differences.

T1  - Ecological mechanisms of invasion success in aquatic macrophytes
AN  - 1646554149
AB  - Issue Title: Aquatic Invasive Species

              
Aquatic plants (macrophytes) are important components of freshwater ecosystems and serve numerous purposes that structure aquatic communities. Although macrophytes represent an essential component of stable aquatic communities, invasive macrophytes negatively alter ecosystem properties. Non-native, invasive species have been identified as a major cause of biodiversity loss and the increasing prevalence of invasive species has prompted studies to help understand their impacts and to conserve biodiversity. Studying mechanisms of invasion also give insight into how communities are structured and assembled. This paper examined mechanisms that contribute to macrophyte invasion through a literature review. Mechanisms identified with this review included competition, enemy release, evolution of increased competitive ability, mutualisms, invasional meltdown, novel weapons, allelopathy, phenotypic plasticity, naturalization of related species, empty niche, fluctuating resources, opportunity windows, and propagule pressure; and were then placed within the context of the invasion process. Results of this review indicated that many invasion mechanisms have been tested with fully aquatic macrophytes with varied levels of support (i.e., some mechanisms are not supported by evidence in the context of macrophyte invasions). Future research should continue the search for evidence of invasion mechanisms that allow introduced species to establish. It is likely that general principles governing these invasions do not exist, at least among comparisons across ecosystem types. However, ecologists should continue to search for general patterns within definable ecosystem units to increase understanding about factors contributing to invasibility.

T1  - Freshwater hotspots of biological invasion are a function of species-pathway interactions
AN  - 1646554108
AB  - Issue Title: Aquatic Invasive Species

              
The introduction and spread of aquatic invasive species constitutes a global epidemic that continues to homogenize the world's aquatic flora and fauna. Species invasions are occurring at an unprecedented scale, yet few centrally organized distributional databases can accurately display location information used to prioritize management efforts within a watershed, region, or political boundary. For particularly harmful groups of invaders such as some freshwater invertebrates, one consequence is that predictive power is limited because current invasion patterns are unknown. We used the Nonindigenous Aquatic Species database of the US Geological Survey to determine current hotspots of invertebrate invasion in the US and compared those patterns with better-documented fish invasions. Invasive freshwater invertebrates were densely clustered in the Laurentian Great Lakes region compared to invasive fish that were concentrated in Florida and the Southwest. However, temporal patterns of fish and invertebrate invasions did not significantly differ. Ballast water was the most important source of invertebrate introductions, whereas fish were more often introduced by stocking, aquaculture, and aquarium release. A centralized database of current species distributions, ideally at the global scale, would greatly inform prevention and mitigation efforts for harmful species invasions.

T1  - Temporal effects on host-parasite associations in four naturalized goby species living in sympatry
AN  - 1646554099
AB  - Issue Title: Aquatic Invasive Species

              
Introduced host species are often characterised by reduced parasite numbers compared to their native populations. Any such advantage gained from parasite release following introduction into a new area may often diminish over a short period as the new host gradually acquires local parasites. In this study, the metazoan parasite communities of four goby species (Proterorhinus semilunaris, Ponticola kessleri, Neogobius melanostomus, and Neogobius fluviatilis) recently introduced into the lower River Rhine were investigated. Mean parasite abundance and infracommunity richness were positively associated with time since host introduction, both parasite variables being the highest in P. semilunaris. In Ponticola and Neogobius species, parasite species richness and the dominance of larval parasites in the Lower Rhine were similar to that for non-native populations in the middle Danube. Sporadic local parasite acquisition and infection, predominantly by species commonly found in the native range, led to a relatively high qualitative similarity in parasite communities between hosts. The relationship between parasite abundance and fish size reflected size-dependant food selectivity and/or parasite accumulation throughout the host's life. Data from this study emphasise the importance of duration of co-occurrence, host habitat and foraging preference, as well as the co-introduction of suitable intermediate hosts, for parasite community composition in related species.

T1  - Experimental evaluation of preferences of an invasive Ponto-Caspian gammarid Pontogammarus robustoides (Amphipoda, Gammaroidea) for mineral and plant substrata
AN  - 1646554096
AB  - Issue Title: Aquatic Invasive Species

              
Pontogammarus robustoides has spread across Europe since the second half of the twentieth century. It is often regarded as a psammophilous and/or phytophilous species. We studied preferences of P. robustoides for 5 mineral substrata of different grain sizes, 5 plant species and 3 artificial plants differing in leaf shape. We tested 10 gammarid individuals in 24-h pairwise choice tests in darkened tanks. Adults selected stones of 27 ± 4.8-mm grain diameter, rather than smaller or larger objects, whereas juveniles preferred particles of 15 ± 3.2-mm grain diameter. Structurally complex plants (natural and artificial) were most preferred for both age groups. Juveniles, unlike adults, preferred natural plants over artificial ones and mineral substrata. Adults preferred mineral materials over macrophytes and did not differentiate between natural and artificial plants. Juveniles did not avoid areas occupied by adults, but in their presence exhibited significantly stronger preferences for substrata providing them with suitable shelters. Habitats selected by gammarids in our study somewhat differed from those commonly used in the field, indicating their high plasticity. Different preferences of adults and juveniles may help them avoid competition and/or cannibalism in the field.

T1  - Ecology of the invasive New Zealand mud snail, Potamopyrgus antipodarum (Hydrobiidae), in a mediterranean-climate stream system
AN  - 1646554094
AB  - Issue Title: Aquatic Invasive Species

              
The New Zealand mud snail, Potamopyrgus antipodarum, is a widely distributed non-native species of management concern on four continents. In a southern California stream, P. antipodarum abundance, which ranged from ca. <10 to nearly 150,000 snails m^sup -2^, was related to discharge and temperature patterns. Laboratory experiments indicated that P. antipodarum (1) survivorship decreased from 13 to 27°C, but its growth rate was higher at 13 and 20°C than 27°C; (2) grazing rates were similar to those of native algivores in short-term trials; (3) grazing impact was greater than that of a native hydrobiid snail in longer-term trials; (4) ingested different diatom sizes than some other grazers; (5) reduced the abundances of medium-sized and large diatoms, and several filamentous cyanobacteria and chlorophytes, while increasing the relative abundances of tough filamentous chlorophytes (e.g., Cladophora); (6) impact on other grazing invertebrates was species specific, ranging from competition to facilitation; (7) reduced the survivorship of Anaxyrus boreas tadpoles; and (8) was consumed by non-native Procambarus clarkii and naiads of Aeshna and Argia. Ecological effects of introduced P.antipodarum are subtle, occurring primarily at transitory high densities, but flow regulation may enhance their effects by eliminating high flows that reduce their population sizes.

T1  - Plant invaders in European and Mediterranean inland waters: profiles, distribution, and threats
AN  - 1646554067
AB  - Issue Title: Aquatic Invasive Species

              
The present brief and selective review focuses on a set of invasive alien aquatic plant species (notably the 21 listed by the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organisation, i.e., five A2 species, 11 invasive, 2 in the Observation List, 1 in the Alert List, 2 noteworthy), on definitions in use, on introduction pathways, and ecological effects, although the social and economic effects of freshwater invaders can be diverse and substantial. Legislation, literature, and scientific research dealing with plant invasions in inland waters often merge different types of invasive plant species and invaded habitats, as there are some overlappings between the concepts of macrophyte, aquatic plants, inland waters, wetlands, and riparian habitats. Freshwater ecosystems may well be the most endangered ecosystems in the world. Countless aquatic plants have been introduced in Europe and in the Mediterranean region, either deliberately because they were thought to be ornamental or otherwise desirable, or accidentally as releases from aquaria, dumping from water gardens, or contaminants. The escape of alien plants from managed environments is also frequent. Aquatic invaders have strong negative impacts on native biodiversity and many different impacts are reported in the literature for Europe and worldwide. Plant invasions in inland waters may be considered as one of a syndrome of factors that characterize degraded aquatic ecosystems. There are a number of risk analysis, impact assessment, ranking systems, decision trees, and prioritization methods available throughout Europe and the EPPO region, but the lack of a common framework for assessing the risks posed by invasive alien aquatic species is seen as a key gap. Successful management should include prevention, habitat restoration, dedicated risk assessment, prioritization, awareness raising, dedicated legislation, collaboration between different stakeholders, development of codes of conduct with the horticultural sector, and prohibiting the sale, purchase, and intentional release of some species in the wild. Actions to protect the European and Mediterranean inland waters from plants invasions are urgently needed and could provide overarching benefits.

T1  - Representing calcification in distribution models for aquatic invasive species: surrogates perform as well as CaCO3 saturation state
AN  - 1646554018
AB  - Issue Title: Aquatic Invasive Species

              
Modeling of invasive species' potential distributions is critical for preventing new invasions. Distribution models use environmental characteristics of observed distributions to determine the suite of conditions that allows invasion. Some variables are directly related to species' biological needs, while others are surrogates that do not directly influence distributions. For aquatic invasive species (AIS) with calcified shells and exoskeletons, one common limiting factor is the chemical restriction on forming calcium carbonate (CaCO3), which is usually represented by conductivity or dissolved calcium. We predicted that conductivity and calcium would not serve as accurate surrogates for CaCO3 saturation state, which is more directly linked to calcification potential. To test this prediction, we fit classification trees to field surveys of northern Wisconsin lakes for three calcifying AIS--rusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus), banded mystery snail (Viviparus georgianus), and Chinese mystery snail (Cipanguladina chinensis). Along with lake area, variables associated with calcification were the best predictors of species distributions. Even though saturation state is the most biologically mechanistic variable, it did not improve model predictions or explain more variability in species presence than its surrogates. Overall, surrogates are sufficient for species distribution modeling in these lakes that exhibit a wide range of chemical states.

T1  - Coexistence in a subtidal habitat in southern Chile: the effects of giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera overgrowth on the slipper limpet Crepipatella fecunda
AN  - 1645748533
AB  - In many coastal areas substrate is the limiting resource for benthic organisms. Some sessile species can be used as secondary substrate, reducing competition and increasing coexistence. In southern Chile, annual populations of Macrocystis pyrifera recruit and grow on the shells of Crepipatella fecunda. This study describes ecological interactions between the kelp and the slipper limpet over an annual cycle. The degree of kelp overgrowth was established by collecting sporophytes and through in situ submarine photography over a 10 month period (starting when kelp recruits became visible and ending when sporophytes were no longer present). Changes in the biochemical composition of the limpet tissue were also recorded by chemical analyses, to evaluate the potential effects (positive/neutral/negative) of kelp on C. fecunda nutritional condition. The results indicate that both species coexist, although kelp overgrowth may cause a decrease in carbohydrates in C. fecunda tissues, restricted to the period when the kelp forest reaches its maximum biomass. Individually, the short duration of the maximum overgrowth period and the size reached by C. fecunda females (up to 65 mm shell length) may enable rapid limpet recovery, avoiding competitive exclusion. On a population level, the M. pyrifera annual cycle generates the needed 'break' for C. fecunda populations, reducing the effects of kelp overgrowth. Thus, in the view of the neutral effect of kelp overgrowth, together with the positive effect of C. fecunda on M. pyrifera recruitment described somewhere else, this ecological interaction can be categorized as commensalism.

T1  - Genetic diversity, population structure, and genetic relatedness of native and non-native populations of Spartina alterniflora (Poaceae, Chloridoideae)
AN  - 1637890906
AB  - Spartina alterniflora Losiel. is a highly invasive species found on the Chinese coast. To characterize the evolutionary mechanisms underlying the success of S. alterniflora in China, we examined the distribution and structure of genetic variation among three native populations at their source locations and five non-native populations in China, at both the chloroplast and nuclear microsatellite loci. Both cpDNA and microsatellite data revealed comparable genetic diversity and population differentiation between the native and introduced regions, which is consistent with the deliberate historical planting of heterogeneous founding groups in China. Bayesian clustering analysis showed that the best two clusters in the introduced region correspond to populations from the Atlantic coast and Gulf coast, respectively, instead of the three ecotypes proposed by a previous study. Investigating genetic composition of individuals suggested that most of the non-native plants might be of Atlantic origin, while some individuals in the Hong Kong population could be genetic admixtures of Atlantic and Gulf origin. This study indicated varied genetic components among populations in China, which imply different sources for the present Chinese populations.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - The Pacific red lionfish (Pterois volitans) has been recognized as a top conservation issue in the world due to its ability as an invasive predator to greatly reduce recruitment of native reef fishes, and with potential long-term ecosystem-level effects. This study tested for territorial aggression of native three spot damselfish (Stegastes planifrons) toward invasive lionfish as a possible source of biotic resistance that may provide prey refugia for coral-reef fish recruits. Throughout July and August 2011, I conducted a field experiment in the Bahamas and the Cayman Islands using a model-bottle design specifically developed for examining three spot damselfish behavior. I compared the behavioral response of 40 damselfish to the presence of invasive lionfish and three native fishes presented individually in clear bottles, as well as to an empty bottle control. Despite lionfish having invaded these islands in different years, damselfish response did not differ between the Bahamas and the Cayman Islands. Overall, damselfish response toward invasive lionfish was not significantly different from the minimal response toward the empty bottle control. In contrast, damselfish actively responded to all native fishes, with species-specific behaviors and levels of aggression that depended on the ecological relationships between damselfish and intruding fishes. Differences in the seafloor rugosity of damselfish territories among study sites also appeared to influence damselfish response. The lack of damselfish response towards lionfish demonstrates that territories are unlikely to serve as native prey refugia, and may indicate lack of recognition of this invasive predator compared to native predators.

T1  - Non-native gobies facilitate the transmission of Bucephalus polymorphus (Trematoda)
AN  - 1782068517
AB  - Background

              
Introduced species can modify local host-parasite dynamics by amplifying parasite infection which can 'spill-back' to the native fauna, whether they are competent hosts for local parasites, or by acting as parasite sinks with 'dilution' of infection decreasing the parasite burden of native hosts. Recently infection by the trematode Bucephalus polymorphus has increased in several European rivers, being attributed to the introduction of intermediate host species from the Ponto-Caspian region. Using a combination of field and experimental data, we evaluated the competence of non-native and native fish as intermediate hosts for B. polymorphus and its role for parasite development in a definitive host.

              
Methods

              
The density of 0+ juvenile fish (the second intermediate hosts for B. polymorphus) was measured in the River Morava, Czech Republic and fish were screened for natural metacercariae infection. The stomach contents of predatory fish that are definitive hosts of B. polymorphus were examined to assess the importance of non-native gobies for parasite transmission. In semi-natural conditions, parasite establishment, initial survival, and maturity rates in experimentally infected definitive hosts pikeperch Sander lucioperca were measured in flukes recovered from native white bream Abramis bjoerkna and non-native tubenose goby Proterorhinus semilunaris and round goby Neogobius melanostomus. Adult fluke size and egg production was also measured to evaluate the potential effect of intermediate host species on parasite fitness.

              
Results

              
We detected high natural infection parameters of B. polymorphus in native cyprinids and non-native gobies compared to data from the period prior to goby establishment. Both fish groups are consumed by predatory fish and represent a major component of the littoral fish community. Parasite establishment and adult size in definitive hosts was equivalent among the second intermediate host species, despite a lower size of metacercariae recovered from round gobies. However, development in the definitive host of flukes recovered from gobies was reduced, showing higher mortality, delayed maturity and lower egg production, in comparison with parasites from native hosts.

              
Conclusions

              
Substantial 'spill-back' of B. polymorphus due to higher transmission rates after establishment of non-native gobies was partially buffered by decreased fitness of B. polymorphus that underwent development in gobies.

T1  - Trophic interaction between topmouth gudgeon (<i>Pseudorasbora parva</i>) and the co-occurring species during summer in the Dniprodzerzhynsk reservoir
AN  - 1761136058
AB  - Topmouth gudgeon, Pseudorasbora parva is the most common invasive fish in Europe, which can compete with the juveniles of valuable commercial fishes. The goal of this work is to study the diet of topmouth gudgeon and trophic relationships with some native fishes inhabiting the littoral zone of the Dniprodzerzhynsk reservoir. The obtained relatively low values of diet overlaps between topmouth gudgeon and other co-occurring cyprinids such as juvenile roach, Rutilus rutilus; silver bream, Blicca bjoerkna; rudd, Scardinius erythrophthalmus; Prussian carp, Carassius gibelio and bleak, Abramis brama, indicate that it is not a serious food competitor for them, especially commercially valuable ones. On the contrary, high diet overlaps were observed among some native cyprinids such as juvenile roach, silver bream, rudd, and bleak. The major prey items of topmouth gudgeon were Chydorus sphaericus and chironomids, whereas other cyprinids selected Bosmina spp. This peculiarity may be due to different vertical distributions of these fish in the littoral zone of the reservoir, where topmouth gudgeon inhabit near-bottom water layers, where they preyed on near-bottom and benthic zooplankters and chironomids, while juvenile roach, silver bream, rudd, and juvenile and adult bleak live in higher water layers, where they preyed on pelagic zooplankton.Alternate abstract:Le Pseudorasbora, Pseudorasbora parva, est le poisson le plus envahissant en Europe, qui peut entrer en compétition avec les juvéniles de poissons de valeur commerciale localement. Le but de ce travail est d’étudier le régime alimentaire du Pseudorasbora et ses relations trophiques avec certains poissons indigènes qui habitent la zone littorale du réservoir de Dniprodzerjynsk. Les valeurs relativement faibles des chevauchements alimentaires obtenues entre le Pseudorasbora et d’autres cyprinidés tels que les juvéniles du gardon, Rutilus rutilus; de la brème bordelière, Blicca bjoerkna; du rotengle, Scardinius erythrophthalmus, du carassin argenté, Carassius gibelio et de la brème, Abramis brama, indiquent que ce n’est pas un concurrent alimentaire important pour eux, en particulier ceux ayant une valeur commerciale. Par contre, des chevauchements de régime importants ont été observés chez certains cyprinidés indigènes comme le gardon juvénile, la brème bordelière, le rotengle, et la brème. Les principales proies du Pseudorasbora sont Chydorus sphaericus et des chironomes, alors que les autres cyprinidés sélectionnent Bosmina spp. Cette particularité peut être due à différentes distributions verticales de ces poissons dans la zone littorale du réservoir, où le Pseudorasbora habite les couches d’eau près du fond, où il se nourrit près du fond de zooplancton benthique et de chironomes tandis que le gardon juvénile, la brème bordelière, le rotengle et les juvéniles et adultes d’ablette vivent dans les couches d’eau supérieures, où ils se nourrissent de zooplancton pélagique.

T1  - Distribution and impact of the alien anemone Sagartia ornata in the West Coast National Park
AN  - 1737492936
AB  - Sagartia ornata is an alien anemone that occurs intertidally within the West Coast National Park (WCNP). The present study aimed to determine the current status and distribution of this anemone, to assess its diet so as to establish the role it may play as predator and to investigate its impact on sandy-shore communities. Sagartia ornata was found to be restricted to the WCNP, where it occurred in densities of up to 508 ± 218 individuals per m^sup 2^. Populations were recorded in Nanozostera capensis seagrass beds for the first time and this alien was absent from two areas in which it had previously occurred. It is concluded that whilst this anemone negatively affects native biota, its current dependence on restricted habitats precludes widespread impacts with the park. With regard to conservation implications, this invasion should be routinely monitored outside the WCNP as in its native range S. ornata occurs on rocky shores and kelp holdfasts, suggesting a potential for spread along the west coast of South Africa.

T1  - Predation on Florida apple snails (Pomacea paludosa) by native and non-native aquatic fauna, and predator-prey size relationships
AN  - 1661373271
AB  - Florida apple snails (Pomacea paludosa) are critical to Florida wetland food webs. Past studies emphasized that large predators consumed relatively large specimens (> 20 mm shells) of these snails. Past studies also identified crayfish, fish, and turtles as predators of hatchling ([asymptotically =]3-6 mm) and juvenile-sized apple snails, but quantitative relationships between these predators and a range of sizes of apple snails are scant. We identified predators not yet reported in the literature: the Seminole killifish (Fundulus seminolis), bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), greater siren (Siren lacertina), and non-indigenous Mayan cichlid (Cichlasoma urophthalmus). We quantified the relationship between predator size and maximum snail size consumed for the following predators: crayfish (Procambarus alleni), turtles (Kinosternon bauri and Sternotherus odoratus), and redear sunfish (Lepomis microlophus). Predator size explained 60% to 78% of the variation in prey size eaten (which ranged from 4 to 22 mm shell length). When offered multiple sizes of prey simultaneously, crayfish and turtles ate snails smaller than the maximum size they were capable of consuming. All size classes of apple snails could fall prey to a variety of predators common to Florida wetlands. Understanding apple snail population ecology requires additional studies to quantify predation impacts on juvenile snails from aquatic predators.

T1  - Investigating the genetic variation and structure of a native unionid mussel in the Laurentian Great Lakes following an invasion of dreissenid mussels
AN  - 1647025263; 21314334
AB  - Despite massive population declines in the open waters of Lake St. Clair due to invasive dreissenid mussels, the St. Clair River Delta has persisted as a refuge habitat for native unionid mussels. This study was conducted to determine how Dreissena-induced population declines might have impacted the genetic population structure of native unionid species. Nine variable microsatellite markers were used to assess the genetic population structure of the Fatmucket mussel (Lampsilis siliquoidea) across 18 sites (n = 341 individuals) within the delta and four of its tributaries. Results indicate that Fatmuckets within the various bays of the St. Clair Delta and tributaries show limited genetic differentiation by geographic distance but still represent a single population with evidence of recent gene flow, little differentiation among sampling sites, relatively high allelic richness at all sites, and little evidence supporting a recent genetic bottleneck. The Fatmucket is the most common species found in the delta and poor genetic health and connectivity of this species might have indicated a dire situation for less common and imperiled species found in the same habitats. Because this did not appear to be the case, little can be assumed about other mussel species.

T1  - 3D modelling of dreissenid mussel impacts on phytoplankton in a large lake supports the nearshore shunt hypothesis and the importance of wind-driven hydrodynamics
AN  - 1641175148
AB  - A three-dimensional hydrodynamic model (ELCOM) coupled with a biological model (CAEDYM) was calibrated with field data from Lake Simcoe (2008) and used to examine the expected impact of dreissenid mussels on the distribution of phytoplankton and nutrients, mussel energetic, and the interactions with hydrodynamic conditions. In accordance with the near-shore shunt hypothesis and the actual distribution of mussels, the model predicted a considerable impact of mussels on phytoplankton in nearshore areas (<15 m depth; -38 % phytoplankton). Horizontal advection could account for the lower (-15 % phytoplankton) offshore impact despite the absence of mussels within this region of the lake. These predictions were similar to observed long-term changes in phytoplankton biomass after the dreissenid mussel invasion. Simulated decreases in the initial mussel biomass by 50 % led to increased phytoplankton nearshore, increased mussel growth and decreased phosphorus excretion relative to ingestion. In contrast, increases in initial mussel biomass by 50 % resulted in minor changes in phytoplankton, since near-bottom depletion of phytoplankton caused growth and energy-limitation of mussels. The model, which was the first to capture metabolically-driven variations of mussel-mediated nutrient cycling, predicted a partial uncoupling of carbon and phosphorus cycling by mussels, driven by varying controls on mussel growth. A 60 % increase in the intensity of three storms during the summer had little net-effect on phytoplankton biomass, but reduced energy-limitation of mussels and increased mussel growth due to increased supply of phytoplankton. Our model demonstrates that near-bottom depletion of phytoplankton is an important process limiting the impact of mussels, and indicates that it affects the mussels' cycling of energy and nutrients. It further suggests that stronger storm events could lead to further increase of flux of organic matter from the pelagic zone to the benthos, further altering energy pathways in the lake.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Evaluating the use of side-scan sonar for detecting freshwater mussel beds in turbid river environments
AN  - 1625470287
AB  - Side-scan sonar is a valuable tool for mapping habitat features in many aquatic systems suggesting it may also be useful for locating sedentary biota. The objective of this study was to determine if side-scan sonar could be used to identify freshwater mussel (unionid) beds and the required environmental conditions. We used side-scan sonar to develop a series of mussel-bed reference images by placing mussel shells within homogenous areas of fine and coarse substrates. We then used side-scan sonar to map a 32-km river reach during spring and summer. Using our mussel-bed reference images, several river locations were identified where mussel beds appeared to exist in the scanned images and we chose a subset of sites (n = 17) for field validation. The validation confirmed that ~60% of the sites had mussel beds and ~80% had some mussels or shells present. Water depth was significantly related to our ability to predict mussel-bed locations: predictive ability was greatest at depths of 1-2 m, but decreased in water >2-m deep. We determined side-scan sonar is an effective tool for preliminary assessments of mussel presence during times when they are located at or above the substrate surface and in relatively fine substrates excluding fine silt.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Water quality effects following establishment of the invasive Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas) in a shallow eutrophic lake: implications for pollution mitigation measures
AN  - 1625469992
AB  - This study investigates whether ecosystem alteration occurred in a shallow, lowland lake following establishment of the alien zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas). Measurements of total phosphorus (TP) loads, lake TP concentrations, phytoplankton (chlorophyll a) and transparency levels for the period 1990-2008 were examined to determine the water quality effects of D. polymorpha. The period of time also included the implementation of catchment measures aimed at reducing phosphorus (P) loading to the lake. A range of loading-response models was tested to explore changes in the net sedimentation rate for P. Results show that while high TP loads from the catchment were reduced, TP concentrations in the lake remained high after D. polymorpha invasion. Decoupling of the previous chlorophyll a-TP relationship also occurred. Results from a TP loading-response model that closely simulated observed concentrations in the lake prior to establishment of D. polymorpha indicated that measured TP post establishment was statistically higher than predicted for the same conditions but without the presence of D. polymorpha. Data presented in the paper highlight the need to consider the potential impacts of invasive species in evaluations of the effectiveness of measures aimed at mitigating aquatic pollution.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Effect of the invasive bivalve Mytilopsis sallei on the macrofaunal fouling community and the environment of Yundang Lagoon, Xiamen, China
AN  - 1612826313
AB  - Issue Title: Challenges in Aquatic Sciences

              
Mytilopsis sallei is a small marine bivalve and is considered as a serious pest. We assume that the invasive bivalve M. sallei changed the community structure of fouling macrofauna and reduced the species diversity index in Yundang Lagoon, Xiamen, China. In order to verify the above hypothesis, test panels were submerged seasonally at five stations during four seasons in Yundang Lagoon, and some chemical parameters were determined. The results showed there were significant differences in density and biomass of M. sallei and other fouling macrofauna with season and with station. The species diversity of the macrofaunal fouling community at stations B and F was low in summer, because high density of M. sallei was found at two stations. There were significantly positive correlations between density and biomass of M. sallei and water temperature and COD, and significantly negative correlations with pH. The results confirmed that this invasive species changed the density and biomass compositions of fouling macrofauna, reduced the species diversity index during the summer period, and somewhat worsened the aquatic environmental quality in Yundang Lagoon, because the pH and the DO were the lowest, and the BOD and the COD were the second lowest in summer among four seasons.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Evaluation of approaches to quantify total residual oxidants in ballast water management systems employing chlorine for disinfection
AN  - 1943899159
AB  - With the maturation and certification of several ballast water management systems that employ chlorine as biocide to prevent the spread of invasive species, there is a clear need for accurate and reliable total residual oxidants (TRO) technology to monitor treatment dose and assure the environmental safety of treated water discharged from ships. In this study, instruments used to measure TRO in wastewater and drinking water applications were evaluated for their performance in scenarios mimicking a ballast water treatment application (e.g., diverse hold times, temperatures, and salinities). Parameters chosen for testing these technologies in the past do not reflect conditions expected during ballast water treatment. Salinity, temperature, and oxidant concentration all influenced the response of amperometric sensors. Oxidation reduction potential (ORP) sensors performed more consistently than amperometric sensors under different conditions but it may be difficult to correlate ORP and TRO measurements for the multitude of biogeochemical conditions found naturally in ballast water. N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine (DPD) analyzers and amperometric sensors were also tested under intermittent sampling conditions mimicking a ballasting scenario, with cyclical dosage and discharge operations. When sampling was intermittent, amperometric sensors required excessive response and conditioning times, whereas DPD analyzers provided reasonable estimates of TRO under the ballasting scenario.

T1  - Transient small boats as a long-distance coastal vector for dispersal of biofouling organisms
AN  - 1609461167
AB  - Issue Title: Special Section: Coastal Lagoons and Estuaries in Mexico: Processes and Vulnerability. Guest Editors: Victor F. Camacho-Ibar and Victor H. Rivera-Monroy

              
Alaska is at the northern end of an apparent latitudinal trend of decreasing coastal marine introductions on the West Coast of North America. Historical propagule supply may have played a role in forming this trend, but few studies have evaluated propagule supply to northern latitudes. Here, we examined the role of small boat traffic as a mechanism of long-distance spread for nonindigenous species (NIS) into coastal Alaska. We used a combination of public records, marina surveys, and boater interviews to characterize vessel traffic patterns and boater behaviors. In-water SCUBA sampling of recently arrived transient boats provided data on extent, richness, composition, and biogeography of biofouling incursions to Alaska from outside of the state. We documented a striking seasonality and directionality of vessel traffic, and most vessels were on voyages of >900 km. Most transient vessels sampled had few organisms, although one third had >100 organisms on submerged surfaces. Several NIS were recorded, including two that are not known to be established in Alaska (Watersipora subtorquata and Amphibalanus improvisus). The seasonal northward pulse of vessels and their cumulative biofouling species represent an important incursion mechanism for species yet to establish at the northern edge of a marine bioinvasion front in the northeastern Pacific. The low numbers of NIS sampled in this study coincide with the low number of marine NIS known from Alaska, which suggests that an opportunity remains to promote awareness and management of the vector to limit NIS influx to the region. This may be particularly relevant for future scenarios of increased vessel traffic and ocean warming, which are likely to interact to increase establishment success of invaders from the south.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Environmental factors affecting behavioural responses of an invasive bivalve to conspecific alarm cues
AN  - 1676358755; PQ0001393270
AB  - Antipredator defences of aquatic animals depend on various environmental parameters. We studied behavioural responses of a Ponto-Caspian invasive bivalve, the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, to conspecific alarm cues. We hypothesized that mussels would change their locomotion and aggregation in response to alarm signals. We also hypothesized that body size, light, substratum quality (suitable or unsuitable for attachment) and inclination would affect mussel defences. Changes in horizontal movement of mussels exposed to the alarm substance depended on light. In the presence of crushed conspecifics illuminated mussels (all sizes) moved longer distances than control individuals, whereas in darkness their reaction was the opposite. The response of small mussels was the strongest. Furthermore, the alarm substance reduced upward relocations of all size groups on an inclined surface but at the same time stimulated their downward movement. Large and medium mussels (but not small individuals) exposed to alarm signals formed aggregations more often than control individuals. This effect was only exhibited on sand, unsuitable for mussel attachment. Mussels were generally more clumped on sand than on hard substratum, suggesting that they did not prefer conspecific shells as attachment sites when alternative substrata were available. All responses of mussels to alarm cues tended to be stronger in light, which is an indirect indication of danger. Our study shows that the responses of the zebra mussel to conspecific alarm cues are not limited to activity reduction, as previously thought. They are adjusted to particular environmental conditions and may also involve increased locomotion when relocation to a safer site gives a better chance of survival.

T1  - Tests to evaluate the ecological impact of treated ballast water on three Chinese marine species
AN  - 1555222082
AB  - Ballast water has been a topic of concern for some time because of its potential to introduce invasive species to new habitats. To comply with the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments, members of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) must equip their ships with on-board treatment systems to eliminate organism release with ballast water. There are many challenges associated with the implementation of this IMO guideline, one of which is the selection of species for testing the ecological impacts of the treated ballast water. In the United States, ballast water toxicity test methods have been defined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. However, the test methods had not been finalized in China until the toxicity test methods for ballast water were established in 2008. The Chinese methods have been based on species from three trophic levels: Skeletonema costatum, Neomysis awatschensis, and Ctenogobius gymnauchen. All three species live in broad estuarine and open sea areas of China; they are sensitive to reference toxicants and acclimatize easily to different conditions. In this paper, the biological characteristics, test processes and statistical analysis methods are presented for the three species. Results indicate that the methods for evaluating these three organisms can be included in the ecological toxicity tests for treated ballast water in China.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Magnitude and Patterns of Change in Submerged Aquatic Vegetation of the Tidal Freshwater Hudson River
AN  - 1550485154
AB  - Three aerial photography inventories were used to examine change in submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) in the tidal freshwater Hudson River over the interval 1997 to 2007. Overall, there was about a 30 % net decline in SAV coverage although there were also many individual areas of expansion. The invasive water chestnut (Trapa natans) did not change appreciably in net cover over the interval, and there was replacement of SAV by water chestnut along with slightly fewer cases of SAV replacing the exotic. A fine-scale (100 m by 100 m quadrats) analysis showed that about 30 % of quadrats that supported vegetation changed by more than 10 % in plant cover and overall SAV was quite dynamic. SAV in the Hudson is limited by light which is in turn controlled by suspended sediment. SAV was rarely found at depths >1 m below low water, and interannual differences in clarity affected the ability of SAV beds to maintain locally supersaturated levels of dissolved oxygen. We found that location within the River channel (proximity to shore) influenced the magnitude and variability in change in SAV between census periods. The physical nature of the adjacent shoreline also affected the magnitude of change with greater declines in cover in areas next to hard-engineered shore types. SAV in the Hudson is highly dynamic, apparently quite resilient, and the control of light by suspended sediment rather than phytoplankton growth offers a contrast to eutrophication-influenced changes in other estuaries. Management and protection of SAV habitat must recognize the highly variable nature of plant cover and that absence in any particular year does not preclude future appearance of submerged plants at that location.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Phytoplankton Growth Balanced by Clam and Zooplankton Grazing and Net Transport into the Low-Salinity Zone of the San Francisco Estuary
AN  - 1550485150
AB  - We estimated the influence of planktonic and benthic grazing on phytoplankton in the strongly tidal, river-dominated northern San Francisco Estuary using data from an intensive study of the low salinity foodweb in 2006-2008 supplemented with long-term monitoring data. A drop in chlorophyll concentration in 1987 had previously been linked to grazing by the introduced clam Potamocorbula amurensis, but numerous changes in the estuary may be linked to the continued low chlorophyll. We asked whether phytoplankton continued to be suppressed by grazing and what proportion of the grazing was by benthic bivalves. A mass balance of phytoplankton biomass included estimates of primary production and grazing by microzooplankton, mesozooplankton, and clams. Grazing persistently exceeded net phytoplankton growth especially for larger cells, and grazing by microzooplankton often exceeded that by clams. A subsidy of phytoplankton from other regions roughly balanced the excess of grazing over growth. Thus, the influence of bivalve grazing on phytoplankton biomass can be understood only in the context of limits on phytoplankton growth, total grazing, and transport.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Predation and Functional Responses of Carcinus maenas and Cancer magister in the Presence of the Introduced Cephalaspidean Philine orientalis
AN  - 1550484804
AB  - An increasing number of examples suggest that interactions among introduced species are ecologically important and relevant to the management of invaded systems. We investigated the potential for the introduced cephalaspidean sea slug Philine orientalis to interfere with the feeding of the introduced European green crab (Carcinus maenas) and the native Dungeness crab (Cancer magister). We observed co-occurrence of crab species and P. orientalis at field sites in Bodega Harbor and Tomales, San Pablo, and San Francisco Bays. In laboratory and field experiments, we determined whether crab feeding was suppressed by P. orientalis and the duration of this suppression for individual crabs. We also used foraging response models to explore changes in the feeding rate of crabs with varying densities of P. orientalis and small bivalve prey. We found that P. orientalis deterred predation by green and Dungeness crabs on small clams in laboratory feeding trials, but not in field experiments with green crabs and P. orientalis. Foraging models predicted that P. orientalis would only affect crab feeding in the field under specific conditions of crab, P. orientalis, and prey densities. These foraging models bridged an important gap between lab and field experiments and allowed us to predict how changes in species abundances at two trophic levels might alter the importance of crab suppression by P. orientalis.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT] Erratum DOI: 10.1007/s12237-014-9788-3

T1  - Spatio-temporal distribution patterns of three stream-dwelling freshwater mussel species: towards a strategy for representative surveys
AN  - 1531588240
AB  - Issue Title: Biology and Conservation of Freshwater Bivalves

              
Conservation efforts for freshwater mussels (Unionoida) require a priori assessments of their populations' status quo. Unfortunately, collection of representative census and other data for most European species is currently hampered by an insufficient understanding of inter- and intra-specific variation in distribution patterns. We assessed distribution and movement in three Unio crassus populations and one sympatric population of Anodonta anatina and Unio pictorum, respectively. We surveyed vertical movement across four sediment depths, and horizontal movement by mark-recapture technique in 3-month intervals. For all the populations, movement and the proportion inhabiting surface layers increased considerably from winter to spring/summer. Spatial aggregation levels remained stable for some populations, while others became increasingly randomly distributed during the study. One U. crassus population exhibited elevated mortality and displayed movement rates exceeding twice those of conspecific populations. The visible proportion of U. crassus populations differed by up to 69% between sites. Current monitoring guidelines in Europe often insufficiently account for the extensive inter- and intra-specific differences in spatio-temporal distribution patterns observed. We suggest developing internationally standardised protocols that specify sampling season and methodology. In particular, U. crassus surveys should be restricted to summer months, and hand-sampling is crucial for some populations.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Survival and extinction of the southern populations of freshwater pearl mussel Margaritifera margaritifera in Russia (Leningradskaya and Novgorodskaya oblast)
AN  - 1531588181
AB  - Issue Title: Biology and Conservation of Freshwater Bivalves

              
Information on the southern populations of the freshwater pearl mussel in Russia (Novgorodskaya and Leningradskaya oblast) is very scarce and has never been mentioned in the international scientific literature. Pearl fishing used to be common in this area in the fifteenth to eighteenth centuries but collapsed afterwards. Long-term field survey undertaken in 2006-2012 revealed that eight populations survived and at least 22 became extinct. The total number of mussels found was about 50,000, with the largest population in one small river consisting of approximately 40,000 individuals. Juveniles were found in six populations. The data obtained are of interest for assessing the resilience and stability of pearl mussel populations in response to potentially negative environmental and particularly anthropogenic impacts. The results are expected to inform future management strategies for conservation of suitable habitats for successful pearl mussel reproduction. The decline in host fish populations in the rivers appears to be the most significant threat to the survival of the existing pearl mussel populations.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

Freshwater bivalves have been highly threatened by human activities, and recently their global decline has been causing conservational and social concern. In this paper, we review the most important research events in freshwater bivalve biology calling attention to the main scientific achievements. A great bias exists in the research effort, with much more information available for bivalve species belonging to the Unionida in comparison to other groups. The same is true for the origin of these studies, since the publishing pattern does not always correspond to the hotspots of biodiversity but is concentrated in the northern hemisphere mainly in North America, Europe and Russia, with regions such as Africa and Southeast Asia being quite understudied. We also summarize information about past, present and future perspectives concerning the most important research topics that include taxonomy, systematics, anatomy, physiology, ecology and conservation of freshwater bivalves. Finally, we introduce the articles published in this Hydrobiologia special issue related with the International Meeting on Biology and Conservation of Freshwater Bivalves held in 2012 in Bragança, Portugal.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Understanding how nutrient cycles and freshwater mussels (Unionoida) affect one another
AN  - 1531587873
AB  - Issue Title: Biology and Conservation of Freshwater Bivalves

              
Nutrient loads and nutrient cycling, especially of phosphorus and nitrogen, are among the most important controls on the character of freshwater ecosystems and have been greatly affected by human actions. Despite the widespread importance of nutrients in freshwater ecosystems, the varied linkages between nutrient cycling and freshwater mussel populations have not been thoroughly described. Here, I explore three of these linkages. First, I suggest that nutrient loads are related to the well-being of mussel populations through several mechanisms, probably producing a nonlinear and non-monotonic relationship between nutrient loads and mussel populations. Second, I discuss the ability of mussels to spatially focus nutrients from the overlying water onto the sediments, which has not been fully appreciated, perhaps because nutrient cycling has been viewed chiefly from the viewpoint of the well-mixed water column rather than the patchy sediments. Third, I discuss the ability of mussel populations to accumulate and release nutrients, introducing time lags into nutrient dynamics and stoichiometry ("nutrient capacitance"). Finally, I propose a speculative analysis of the role of freshwater mussels in the nutrient cycles of pristine river systems, which must have been much greater than in modern rivers, with their high nutrient loads and depleted mussel populations.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Alternative food sources of native and non-native bivalves in a subtropical eutrophic lake
AN  - 1531587859
AB  - Issue Title: Biology and Conservation of Freshwater Bivalves

              
The aim of this study was to evaluate the consumption of alternative food sources (water column and sediment) and the potential competition under different conditions between Diplodon parallelopipedon (native) and Corbicula fluminea (non-native). We evaluated filtration and ingestion rates of water column at 6 and 24 h, held with and without organic matter and different phytoplankton types: needle-shaped green algae (Ankistrodesmus sp.) and filamentous cyanobacteria (Planktothrix agardhii) dominated communities. Our results confirmed higher filtration and ingestion rates per biomass unit for C. fluminea in the presence of sediment without organic matter. However, when we compared the filtration of bivalves held in sediment with organic matter, D. parallelopipedon rates were not significantly different from C. fluminea values. Moreover, in the presence of filamentous cyanobacteria, only C. fluminea filtration and ingestion rates decreased significantly. Our experimental results and previous field evidence concur that C. fluminea were not able to outcompete the native bivalves in organic matter rich sediment and cyanobacteria blooms conditions. The differential responses to the eutrophication process between exotic and native bivalves, apparently favoring the later, might buffer the potential competition interactions allowing their coexistence.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Comparative study of the genotoxic response of freshwater mussels Unio tumidus and Unio pictorum to environmental stress
AN  - 1531587844
AB  - Issue Title: Biology and Conservation of Freshwater Bivalves

              
Genotoxic response of freshwater mussels U. tumidus and U. pictorum to environmental stress was studied using comet assay on hemocytes and gill cells. The mussels were acclimated to controlled laboratory conditions for 10 days, and then exposed at 4 sites in the Sava and Danube rivers in the area of the city of Belgrade. Samples of each species were taken after 7, 14, and 30 days of exposure. The mussels sampled immediately after acclimation served as controls. Genotoxic response in both species was induced earlier at sites receiving untreated wastewaters from the city's main collectors (7 days), than at the site receiving only domestic wastewaters from small settlements located upstream from the city (30 days). There was a correlation between the comet tail intensity values in tissues of exposed mussels and the concentrations of zinc, copper, iron, and arsenic at the exposure sites. The genotoxic responses in both tissues of U. pictorum and in hemocytes of U. tumidus were similar, while U. tumidus gill cells failed to exhibit significant genotoxic response at two sites. These findings, together with higher mortality of U. tumidus at the most polluted sites, promote U. pictorum as a model for genotoxicity monitoring in freshwater environments.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Biodiversity on the brink: an assessment of conservation strategies for North American freshwater mussels
AN  - 1531587837
AB  - Issue Title: Biology and Conservation of Freshwater Bivalves              The North America freshwater mussel fauna has suffered an inordinately high recent extinction rate, and the small size and isolation of many remaining populations portends a continued diminishment of this fauna. Causes of extinction and imperilment are varied but revolve around massive habitat loss, deterioration, and fragmentation. The National Strategy for the Conservation of Native Mussels, published in 1997, has guided efforts to address this crisis. Considerable progress has been made toward several of the Strategies' goals, particularly increasing our knowledge of mussel biology, promoting mussel conservation, and development of techniques for captive mussel propagation. However, mussel conservation should focus more directly on reducing fragmentation through bold and aggressive habitat restoration. In addition to dam removal, improvement in dam tailwater flows, and restoration of channelized streams, identification of factors that eliminated mussels from many otherwise intact streams is critical. Translocation and captive propagation will be key elements in reestablishing mussel assemblages in restored habitats, but these techniques should be used with caution and primarily to increase the occurrence of a species throughout its historical range. Conserving mussel diversity in an ever-changing world is dependent on promoting the natural, long-term sustainability and evolutionary potential of mussel populations.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - OFFSHORE BENTHIC FISH COMMUNITY 6
AN  - 2717890041
AB  - Lake Ontario's offshore benthic fish community includes primarily slimy sculpin, lake whitefish, rainbow smelt, lake trout, burbot, and sea lamprey. Of these, lake trout have been the focus of an international restoration effort for more than three decades. The deepwater sculpin and three species of deepwater ciscoes (Coregonus spp.) that were historically important in the offshore benthic zone became rare or were extirpated by the 1960s. Ecosystem changes continue to influence the offshore benthic fish community, including the effects of dreissenid mussels, the near disappearance of burrowing amphipods (Diporeia spp.) and the increased abundance and expanded geographic distribution of round goby.

T1  - Can differential predation of native and alien corixids explain the success of Trichocorixa verticalis verticalis (Hemiptera, Corixidae) in the Iberian Peninsula?
AN  - 1529991703
AB  - Invasive species represent an increasing fraction of aquatic biota. However, studies on the role and consequences of facilitative interactions among aliens remain scarce. Here, we investigated whether the spread of the alien water boatman Trichocorixa verticalis verticalis in the Iberian Peninsula is related to reduced mortality from predation compared with native Corixidae, especially since Trichocorixa co-occurs with the invasive fishes Gambusia holbrooki and Fundulus heteroclitus. All three invaders have a common native range in North America and are widespread in and around Doñana in SW Spain. Using laboratory experiments, we compared the predation rates by the two exotic fish and native Odonata larvae on Trichocorixa and the native Sigara lateralis. We found no evidence to suggest that Trichocorixa suffers lower predation rates. However, when both corixids were mixed together, predation of Trichocorixa by Odonata larvae was higher. Odonata larvae were size-limited predators and the proportion of corixids ingested was positively correlated with mask length. Since Trichocorixa is smaller than its native competitors, this may explain their higher susceptibility to predation by Odonata. This may be one of various factors explaining why Trichocorixa is particularly dominant in saline habitats where Odonata are rare, while it is still scarce in fresh waters.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AN  - 1564023640
AB  - The apple snail Pomacea maculata is a recent introduction to Florida from its native range in South America. The researchers measured ... values along the shell growth axis of the non-native, aquatic pulmonate gastropod, Pomacea maculata, to determine its life span and seasonal growth pattern in Florida. Age, growth rate, and season of growth of P. maculata were determined from seasonal temperature fluctuations, inferred from ... values measured on aragonite drilled along the shell whorl. Eight of the 22 P. maculata lived less than one year, ten slightly longer than one year, and one into its third year. Three snails yielded indeterminate results. Snails from lakes Tulane and Verona deposited the majority of carbonate during late fall/early winter, whereas growth in Newnans Lake was divided across the seasons. Among specimens taken alive, and for which time of death was known, there were offsets along the shell margin with respect to ... values predicted from ... and temperature.

T1  - Is habitat amount important for biodiversity in rocky shore systems? A study of South African mussel assemblages
AN  - 1539394143
AB  - Habitat-forming species on rocky shores are often subject to high levels of exploitation, but the effects of subsequent habitat loss and fragmentation on associated species and the ecosystem as a whole are poorly understood. In this study, the effects of habitat amount on the fauna associated with mussel beds were investigated, testing for the existence of threshold effects at small landscape scales. Specifically, the relationships between mussel or algal habitat amount and: associated biodiversity, associated macrofaunal abundance and density of mussel recruits were studied at three sites (Kidd's Beach, Kayser's Beach and Kini Bay) on the southern and south-eastern coasts of South Africa. Samples, including mussel-associated macrofauna, of 10 × 10 cm were taken from areas with 100 % mussel cover (Perna perna or a combination of P. perna and Mytilus galloprovincialis) at each site. The amount of habitat provided by mussels and algae surrounding the sampled areas was thereafter determined at the 4.0 m^sup 2^ scale. A number of significant positive relationships were found between the amount of surrounding mussel habitat and the abundances of several taxa (Anthozoa, Malacostraca and Nemertea). Likewise, there were positive relationships between the amount of surrounding algal habitat and total animal abundance as well as abundance of mussel recruits at one site, Kini Bay. In contrast, abundance of mussel recruits showed a significant negative relationship with the amount of mussel habitat at Kayser's Beach. Significant negative relationships were also detected between the amount of mussel habitat and species richness and total abundance at Kidd's Beach, and between amount of mussel habitat and the abundance of many taxa (Bivalvia, Gastropoda, Maxillopoda, Ophiuroidea, Polychaeta and Pycnogonida) at all three sites. No threshold effects were found, nor were significant relationships consistent across the investigated sites. The results indicate that the surrounding landscape is important in shaping the structure of communities associated with these mussel beds, with significant effects of the amount of surrounding habitat per se. The strength and the direction of habitat effects vary, however, between shores and probably with the scale of observation as well as with the studied dependent variables (e.g. diversity, abundance, mussel recruitment, species identity), indicating the complexity of the processes structuring macrofaunal communities on these shores.

T1  - Benthic respiration and stoichiometry of regenerated nutrients in lake sediments with Dreissena polymorpha
AN  - 1535190811
AB  - The effect of patchy colonies of the invasive zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) on sedimentary processes was investigated in a mesotrophic lake (Plateliai Lake, Lithuania). Benthic fluxes of O2, TCO2, CH4, Mn^sup 2+^, Fe^sup 2+^, N2, the inorganic forms of N, Si and P and dissolved organic C and N were quantified by dark incubations of sediments cores, with and without D. polymorpha. Individual mussels also were incubated for metabolic measurements. Sediments with D. polymorpha had significantly higher O2 and TCO2 fluxes and displayed higher rates of denitrification. The presence of mussels also resulted in higher regeneration of P and N (mostly as ammonium) while the effect on Si was not significant. However, likely due to the low zebra mussel biomass (57.2 ± 25.3 g^sub SFDW^ m^sup -2^), biodeposition has not changed the ratio between anaerobic and total respiration. Methane and reduced metals fluxes were in fact similar in the presence and absence of D. polymorpha. Incubations of mussels without sediments confirmed that bivalve metabolism was the main driver of benthic respiration and nutrient recycling. Nitrate production suggested the presence of nitrifiers associated with the molluscs. The main outcome of this study was that zebra mussels alter the quantity and the stoichiometry of nutrients regenerated by the benthic compartment. The enhancement of nitrogen loss via denitrification, by a factor of 1.5, was much less pronounced than the increase in ammonium recycling rate, stimulated by a factor of 33. Negligible PO^sub 4^ ^sup 3-^ fluxes in bare sediments (-3.4 ± 6.8 [mu]mol m^sup -2^h^sup -1^) increased in the presence of mussels and considerable amounts of this nutrient (69.6 ± 29.4 [mu]mol m^sup -2^h^sup -1^) were mobilized to the water column. Further research should address other nutrient sources to the lake to verify whether altered rates and stoichiometry of benthic regeneration can affect primary producer community composition and activity.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Zebra mussel [delta]^sup 13^C and [delta]^sup 15^N as a proxy for depth-specific pelagic isotope profiles and lake temperature
AN  - 1516046538
AB  - Issue Title: European Large Lakes III. Large lakes under changing environmental conditions

              
Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) can be used to provide a baseline stable isotope signature, time-integrated with primary production. However, since zebra mussels are uncommon in pelagic zones, their potential as reference species in pelagic water columns has not been fully explored. By investigating mussels growing suspended on a single vertical cable in Lake Constance, we were able to document seasonal (April, May, and August) and depth-dependent (0-22 m) variation in mussel δ ^sup 15^[Nu] and δ ^sup 13^C. We found a strong correlation between temperature and mussel δ ^sup 15^N from differing depths^sub ;^ and a strong relationship between temperature and [Delta]^sup 15^[Nu] (estimated as δ ^sup 15^[Nu]^sub mussel^ - δ ^sup 15^[Nu]^sub POM^) and [Delta]^sup 13^C (δ ^sup 13^C^sub mussel^ - δ ^sup 13^C^sub POM^). In a pattern that remained consistent over all months, [Delta]^sup 15^[Nu] decreased with temperature, to the extent that negative values were recorded at temperatures >13°C. Utilizing cable-dwelling pelagic mussels as indicators of variation in isotope and temperature for pelagic water could be used as a novel field approach, comparable to in situ experimentation. We suggest that the pelagic mussel approach can be employed in tandem with benthic or littoral mussel isotope values, to develop mussel-based lake isoscapes. Such isoscapes may be pertinent to the study of seasonal trophic limnoecology and in tracking the movements of animals.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The nearshore shunt and the decline of the phytoplankton spring bloom in the Laurentian Great Lakes: insights from a three-dimensional lake model
AN  - 1516044860
AB  - Issue Title: European Large Lakes III. Large lakes under changing environmental conditions

              
Dreissenid mussels have been hypothesized to cause selective decreases of phytoplankton in nearshore areas (nearshore shunt hypothesis) as well as the near-complete loss of the offshore phytoplankton spring bloom in some Laurentian Great Lakes. To evaluate whether mussels can reasonably be expected to mediate such changes, we extended the three-dimensional hydrodynamic-ecological model (ELCOM-CAEDYM) to include mussels as a state variable and applied it to Lake Erie (USA-Canada). Mussel-mediated decreases in mean phytoplankton biomass were highly sensitive to the assigned mussel population size in each basin. In the relatively deep east basin, mussels were predicted to decrease phytoplankton in both nearshore and offshore zones, even during periods of thermal stratification but especially during the spring phytoplankton maximum. Spatially, impacts were associated with mussel distributions but could be strong even in areas without high mussel biomass, consistent with advection from areas of higher mussel biomass. The results supported the nearshore shunt hypothesis that mussel impacts on phytoplankton should be greater in nearshore than offshore waters and also supported suggestions about the emerging importance of deep water offshore mussels. The results of this study provide an important insight into ecological role of mussels in lowering plankton productivity in some world's largest lakes.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Assemblage structure: an overlooked component of human-mediated species movements among freshwater ecosystems
AN  - 2417706719
AB  - The spread and impact of alien species among freshwater ecosystems has increased with global trade and human movement; therefore, quantifying the role of anthropogenic and ecological factors that increase the risk of invasion is an important conservation goal. Two factors considered as null models when assessing the potential for invasion are colonization pressure (i.e., the number of species introduced) and propagule pressure [i.e., the number (propagule size), and frequency (propagule number), of individuals of each species introduced]. We translate the terminology of species abundance distributions to the invasion terminology of propagule size and colonization size (PS and CS, respectively). We conduct hypothesis testing to determine the underlying statistical species abundance distribution for zooplankton assemblages transported between freshwater ecosystems; and, on the basis of a lognormal distribution, construct four hypothetical assemblages spanning assemblage structure, rank-abundance gradient (e.g., even vs uneven), total abundance (of all species combined), and relative contribution of PS vs CS. For a given CS, many combinations of PS and total abundance can occur when transported assemblages conform to a lognormal species abundance distribution; therefore, for a given transportation event, many combinations of CS and PS are possible with potentially different ecological outcomes. An assemblage exhibiting high PS but low CS (species poor, but highly abundant) may overcome demographic barriers to establishment, but with lower certainty of amenable environmental conditions in the recipient region; whereas, the opposite extreme, high CS and low PS (species rich, but low abundance per species) may provide multiple opportunities for one of n arriving species to circumvent environmental barriers, albeit with lower potential to overcome demographic constraints. Species abundance distributions and the corresponding influence of CS and PS are some of many influential factors (e.g., demographic and genetic stochasticity, environmental variability, composition of recipient ecosystems) that will help refine an understanding of establishment risk following the human-mediated movement of species.

T1  - Experimental evidence that ecological effects of an invasive fish are reduced at high densities
AN  - 1517744676; 24532212
AB  - Understanding the relationship between invasive species density and ecological impact is a pressing topic in ecology, with implications for environmental management and policy. Although it is widely assumed that invasive species impact will increase with density, theory suggests interspecific competition may diminish at high densities due to increased intraspecific interactions. To test this theory, we experimentally examined intra- and interspecific interactions between a globally invasive fish, round goby (Neogobius melanostomus), and three native species at different round goby densities in a tributary of the Laurentian Great Lakes. Eighteen 2.25 m^sup 2^ enclosures were stocked with native fish species at natural abundances, while round gobies were stocked at three different densities: 0 m^sup -2^, 2.7 m^sup -2^, and 10.7 m^sup -2^. After 52 days, native fish growth rate was significantly reduced in the low density goby treatment, while growth in the high density goby treatment mirrored the goby-free treatment for two of three native species. Invertebrate density and gut content weight of native fishes did not differ among treatments. Conversely, gut content weight and growth of round gobies were lower in the high goby density treatment, suggesting interactions between round gobies and native fishes are mediated by interference competition amongst gobies. Our experiment provides evidence that invasive species effects may diminish at high densities, possibly due to increased intraspecific interactions. This is consistent with some ecological theory, and cautions against the assumption that invasive species at moderate densities have low impact.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Waterbird-mediated passive dispersal is a viable process for crayfish (Procambarus clarkii)
AN  - 1499455137
AB  - Human transport and active dispersal of the red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) contribute to its rapid spread. However, some small aquatic organisms can be transported by birds. We made two hypotheses related to waterbird-mediated passive dispersal of juvenile crayfish. The first is that, depending on water depth, recently hatched crayfish can attach to ducks, initiating passive external transport (i.e., ectozoochory). The second is that recently hatched crayfish can survive bird flight, being affected by crayfish features, flight distance, and environmental conditions. A first experiment tested the attachment of juvenile crayfish to ducks at different water depths by using a freshly dead duck and tanks with crayfish. Another set of three experiments tested crayfish survival during air transportation. To simulate bird flight, we first used a vehicle moving at bird flight speed, and we then used trained pigeons. Several flight distances, environmental conditions, and crayfish sizes were tested. Our results showed that juvenile crayfish were capable of clinging to duck feathers and were transported when ducks were removed from the water. Furthermore, some juveniles of P. clarkii were able to survive long-distance transport when suspended outside a moving vehicle or when transported by birds. The probability of success was affected by water depth, crayfish size, distance travelled, and relative humidity. Our results support the occurrence of passive transportation of this invader by means of attachment to birds. These findings indicate that waterbird-mediated passive dispersal should be taken into account to explain P. clarkii's rapid spread and should be considered when managing its invasions.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Colonization and dispersal patterns of the invasive American brine shrimp Artemia franciscana (Branchiopoda: Anostraca) in the Mediterranean region
AN  - 1491042469
AB  - Cysts of the brine shrimp Artemia franciscana are harvested from the Great Salt Lake (GSL) and San Francisco Bay (SFB) saltworks in the USA, and marketed worldwide to provide live food for aquaculture. This species has become invasive across several countries. We investigated (1) if the introduced populations in the Mediterranean region could have originated from these USA populations, (2) how the genetic diversity of Mediterranean compares to that at GSL and SFB, and (3) if genetic patterns in the Mediterranean can shed light on colonization routes. We sequenced a fragment of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and screened microsatellites loci from Mediterranean populations and the two putative USA sources. Haplotypes from Mediterranean populations were identical or closely related to those from SFB and GSL, and not related to other available American populations. Microsatellite analyses showed a reduced population diversity for most Mediterranean populations suggesting bottleneck effects, but few populations were showing similar or higher genetic diversity than native ones, which are likely to be admixed from both GSL and SFB because of multiple introductions. Results suggest natural dispersal, potentially via flamingos, between two Spanish populations. Our analyses show that all invaded populations could have originated from those commercialized USA populations. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Dietary variability in fishes: the roles of taxonomic, spatial, temporal and ontogenetic factors
AN  - 1465139003
AB  - In spite of the general use of diet data in ecological research, still very little is known about the relative roles of spatial, temporal and biotic (e.g. taxonomic identity, size, sex) factors in dietary variability of fishes. Here, we applied canonical correspondence analysis and variation partitioning to examine the roles of taxonomic, annual, seasonal, lake basin, habitat and ontogenetic (standard length, L ^sub S^) factors in the dietary variation of fishes in large and shallow Lake Balaton, Hungary. The analyses were performed at the assemblage (15 fish species) and the individual species levels, and based on high (24 fine resource categories) and low resolution (nine broad resource categories) diet data. As hypothesised, most of the explained variation related to interspecific differences, while the roles of sampling year, season, lake area, habitat and L ^sub S^ proved to be unexpectedly low at the assemblage level. In addition, no regularity was found in how the relative roles of these factors change between fish species. The high ratio of the unexplained variation suggests that individual variations in foraging strategies and resource use of fishes and unascertained stochastic processes had a strong influence on dietary variability both at the assemblage and the individual species levels.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Drivers of change in a redeveloped urban lake: long term trends in a simplified system
AN  - 1668268537; PQ0001342911
AB  - Shallow urban lakes are inherently variable due to their unpredictable mixing regime and often rapid response to the external environment. They therefore present a number of challenges to water managers seeking to improve water quality. Salford Quays (8.14 ha, depth = 6.6 m), Greater Manchester, UK is an example of a managed artificial shallow urban water body that provides a number of ecosystem services but in the past was one of the most polluted areas of water in the UK. Here we examine the long-term dataset (1985 - 2010) associated with restoration and document changes of several orders of magnitude in both phosphorus and chlorophyll- alpha . Three distinct phases of phytoplankton community succession were identified over the restoration period: cyanobacterial dominance, an abundance of larger chlorophytes and finally a preponderance of r-selected taxa such as nanoplankters and cryptomonads. We show that these phases relate to changes in limitation from photolimitation to increased zooplankton grazing and, finally, the combined effects of low nutrients and filter feeding by the invasive bivalve Dreissena polymorpha. Owing to water column mixing and the lack of a littoral zone in the main basins, Salford Quays will be relatively unaffected by confounding variables such as stratification and therefore offers an insight into the processes of community change in similar artificial and heavily modified natural systems elsewhere. In addition the Quays offer an excellent case study of urban water management and serves as an example both of best practice and a target ecosystem to direct the restoration of other urban waterways.

T1  - A new record of Mytilopsis leucophaeata (Bivalvia: Dreissenidae) in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil)
AN  - 1644676027
AB  - Mytilopsis leucophaeata naturally occurs in oligo- to mesohaline estuaries along the Atlantic coast of the USA and Mexico. In Brazil, M. leucophaeata was first recorded in 2004 in estuaries adjacent to the Port of Recife (Pernambuco State, north-eastern Brazil). Here, we present the second record of the species in Brazil, and the first for the south-eastern region, in the Rodrigo de Freitas lagoon (Rio de Janeiro State). This lagoon, located within a major urbanized area of Rio de Janeiro City, is highly affected by coastal development, but used for various nautical sports. The imminence of the Olympic Games, to be held in Rio de Janeiro in 2016, requires specific attention to the importance of monitoring and controlling this new invasive species. Action has to be taken to prevent its dispersal to other estuarine and lagoon ecosystems of Rio de Janeiro State due to movement of boats and sport equipment.

T1  - Assessing the extent of establishment of Undaria pinnatifida in Plymouth Sound Special Area of Conservation, UK
AN  - 1644675947
AB  - The north-west Pacific kelp, Undaria pinnatifida, was first discovered in Europe on the Mediterranean coast of France (1971) and introduced to Brittany for aquaculture (1983). In the north-east Atlantic, it occurs in Spain, France, the British Isles, Belgium and Holland. The first UK record was in the Hamble estuary (1994) and it was found off Plymouth in 2003. The UK distribution is presently restricted to the south of England and the northern Irish Sea. We assessed the distribution of U. pinnatifida and native kelps and their allies in Plymouth Sound (at 0 to +1 m relative to Chart Datum). Undaria pinnatifida was widespread along rocky shores, on other hard substrata and grew in the same areas as Saccharina latissima and Saccorhiza polyschides. Undaria pinnatifida was significantly more abundant on vertical substrata than on upward-facing hard substrata. It was almost as common as all of the other kelp species combined on vertical substrata but was outnumbered by native species on upward-facing substrata. Undaria pinnatifida has become the visually dominant macroalga in marinas and has spread to surrounding natural habitats in Plymouth Sound. The extent to which it will outcompete native kelps requires monitoring, especially in conservation areas.

T1  - Trying to fit in: are patterns of orientation of a keystone grazer set by behavioural responses to ecosystem engineers or wave action?
AN  - 1475028513; 23996227
AB  - The distribution of animals varies at different temporal and spatial scales. At the smallest scale, distribution may be orientated in regard to particular environmental variables or habitat features. For animals on the rocky intertidal, the processes which set and maintain patterns of distribution and abundance in wave-exposed areas are well studied, with explanatory models focused on wave action and, more recently, the role of biogenic habitats. In contrast, patterns of orientation by intertidal animals have received less attention, although having ecological and fitness consequences. Here, we report tests of competing models to explain the observation that limpets on steeply sloped surfaces orientate downwards. A greater proportion of downwards-facing limpets was found in sheltered sites and areas without barnacles and this pattern was consistent across many shores and sampling occasions. Additionally, the frequency at which limpets were dislodged after a storm was independent of orientation. To test whether orientation is a behavioural response to habitat-forming barnacles, barnacles were removed and/or killed from patches of substrata and the change in proportion of downwards-facing limpets measured. The proportion increased with barnacle removal and this behaviour was a response to the structure of the barnacles, not a biotic effect associated with the living organism. Our study suggests that biogenic habitat not wave action sets patterns of limpet orientation and barnacle shells, regardless of whether the barnacle is alive or not, limit the ability of limpets to adopt a downward orientation.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Impacts of invasive crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) on endangered freshwater pearl mussels (Margaritifera laevis and M. togakushiensis) in Japan
AN  - 1446225562
AB  - The invasive alien crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus is considered harmful to freshwater pearl mussels Margaritifera laevis and M. togakushiensis. It also often colonises mussel habitats in Japan. In order to test the negative effects of alien crayfish on mussels, we evaluated the predation impact of signal crayfish on freshwater pearl mussels in vitro. We tested the relationship between the survival/injury rates of mussels and crayfish predation with respect to different sizes of mussels (four classes based on shell length: 10, 30, 50 and 70 mm). Crayfish selectively fed on the flesh of the 10-mm size class mussels after breaking their shells. The shell margins of mussels in all size classes were injured by crayfish. Results also showed that crayfish particularly injured the 50-mm size class of mussels. This observation could be attributed to this mussel size being the most suitable shell size (29.56-37.73 mm in carapace length) that the crayfish can effectively hold. This study shows that the presence of invasive crayfish reduces freshwater pearl mussel populations by damaging the shell margins and/or killing the mussels. This negative impact of invasive crayfish not only decreases the mussel population but could also limit mussel recruitment, growth and reproduction.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The role of Actinobacteria in taste and odour episodes involving geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol in aquatic environments
AN  - 1943101784
AB  - The secondary metabolites geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol (2-MIB) provide soil with its characteristic earthy-musty odour, being notably produced by the abundant spore-forming filamentous bacterial genus Streptomyces, among other Actinobacteria. Taste and odour (T&O) problems attributed to these compounds affect drinking water supplies worldwide, often occurring sporadically and untraced to their biological origins. A number of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms are recognised geosmin and 2-MIB producers in aquatic environments. However, the focus of this paper is to assess the potential contribution of Actinobacteria to this water quality issue. To date, the aquatic ecology of these bacteria remains poorly understood and debate surrounds whether they exist solely as dormant spores of terrestrial origin or are capable of growing and biosynthesising these odourous compounds in aquatic environments. The Actinobacteria which are known to produce geosmin and 2-MIB are identified and a critical assessment of habitats within aquatic environments in which they may be metabolically active residents and thus potential sources of T&O is provided. Current understandings of the chemical ecology and biosynthetic pathways of geosmin and 2-MIB, as well as the conditions under which these secondary metabolites are produced by Streptomyces, are reviewed.

T1  - Nuclear and mitochondrial genetic variability of an old invader, Dreissena polymorpha (Bivalvia), in French river basins
AN  - 1448222117; 18720633
AB  - Analyzing non-native species after their establishment can shed light on factors responsible for their colonization success. The zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha), a species of Ponto-Caspian origin, is a worldwide invader, and was first reported in northern France in the nineteenth century. The genetic diversity and structure of D. polymorpha from five river basins (nine locations) in France were estimated using nuclear markers (amplified fragment length polymorphisms, AFLPs; 154 loci) and sequences from a 514 bp mitochondrial DNA region (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I; COI). Results from the two types of markers were generally congruent, although COI sequences showed limited genetic polymorphism, with one predominant and cosmopolitan haplotype (84 % of the individuals). Both COI and AFLPs revealed that the most divergent and the least polymorphic sample was the one from southern France. This population was the most distant geographically from all the others and among the most recent introductions reported in France. In addition, in northern France, AFLP loci revealed a significant river basin effect, despite a common pathway of introduction. This result suggests a shift in local population dynamics, perhaps due to stochastic recruitment, and underlines the importance of local dispersal (e.g. via planktonic larvae) compared to overland transport in shaping the population structure of this naturalized freshwater mollusk.

T1  - A global assessment of freshwater fish introductions in mediterranean-climate regions
AN  - 1439196759
AB  - Issue Title: Streams in mediterranean climate regions: lessons learned from the last decade

              
Mediterranean-climate regions (med-regions) are global hotspots of endemism facing mounting environmental threats associated with human-related activities, including the ecological impacts associated with non-native species introductions. We review freshwater fish introductions across med-regions to evaluate the influences of non-native fishes on the biogeography of taxonomic and functional diversity. Our synthesis revealed that 136 freshwater fish species (26 families, 13 orders) have been introduced into med-regions globally. These introductions, and local extirpations, have increased taxonomic and functional faunal similarity among regions by an average of 7.5% (4.6-11.4%; Jaccard) and 7.2% (1.4-14.0%; Bray-Curtis), respectively. Faunal homogenisation was highest in Chile and the western Med Basin, whereas sw Cape and the Aegean Sea drainages showed slight differentiation (decrease in faunal similarity) over time. At present, fish faunas of different med-regions have widespread species in common (e.g. Gambusia holbrooki, Cyprinus carpio, Oncorhynchus mykiss, Carassius auratus, and Micropterus salmoides) which are typically large-bodied, non-migratory, have higher physiological tolerance, and display fast population growth rates. Our findings suggest that intentional and accidental introductions of freshwater fish have dissolved dispersal barriers and significantly changed the present-day biogeography of med-regions across the globe. Conservation challenges in med-regions include understanding the ecosystem consequences of non-native species introductions at macro-ecological scales.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Stable isotope compositions of recent Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas) shells: paleoenvironmental implications
AN  - 1437177450
AB  - Stable carbon and oxygen isotope studies are among the major proxies in investigations of recent and ancient freshwater environments. Mollusc shells are one the most frequently studied carbonates. In the present paper, stable carbon and oxygen isotope compositions of Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas) shells, regarded as the most aggressive freshwater invader worldwide, is compared with the stable isotope composition of ambient water. Macrophytes with modern D. polymorpha shells attached were sampled twice, in June and August 2011, from four transects established within the littoral of Lake Lednica (western Poland). The macrophytes were sampled between 0.5 and 7 m of depth at each site from the restricted area of the lake bottom. In order to avoid the influence of ontogeny on the results obtained the stable isotope compositions of shells of equal or nearly equal sizes within one population were compared. A significant spread was observed in the stable isotope signatures in the D. polymorpha shells, particularly in the δ^sup 13^C values derived from one population. The spread in δ^sup 13^C and δ^sup 18^O values was observed in both juvenile and adult shells; however, it increased with age. It is suggested that stable isotope investigations of D. polymorpha shells should not be performed on single shells, as the isotope values will not be representative of the coeval individuals within population. While the shells of D. polymorpha were close to oxygen isotope equilibrium with the ambient water, they were characterised by a 1.5-2 [per thousand] depletion in ^sup 13^C relative to δ^sup 13^C^sub DIC^. Both the spread in δ^sup 13^C values in the shells and the ^sup 13^C depletion observed in the shells are interpreted as resulting from a strong metabolic influence on shell composition. Because the offset observed between dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and shells is relatively constant, the stable carbon isotope composition of D. polymorpha shells may reflect environmental conditions and thus may be used as a palaeolimnological proxy.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Interrelations between Dreissena polymorpha colonization and autotrophic periphyton development - a field study in a temperate floodplain lake
AN  - 1512336046; 19437950
AB  - Temporal changes in autotrophic periphyton (algae and cyanobacteria) in relation to the colonization of Dreissena polymorpha, an invasive species, were investigated in situ using artificial substrata (glass slides) from April to August of 2008 in a Danubian floodplain. The colonization of cyanobacteria and planktonic diatoms firmly attached to the substrata followed by the development of apical pad forming diatoms and stalk forming diatoms, resulted in the rapid formation of a three-dimensional structure of periphyton. Increasing water temperatures, together with the well developed autotrophic periphyton, supported the colonization of Dreissena. A total of 16 size classes of Dreissena were found during the gradual mussel community development. The community most likely formed from the initially settled larvae which dominated the first period of aggregation, while adult individuals dominated the later phase, contributing to the increase in habitat complexity. High competition for space and nutri - ents on small-size substrata limited the autotrophic periphyton to achieve the "climax community" characterized by filamentous green algae. Consequently, algal abundance decreased and diatoms firmly attached to the substrata prevailed. The decrease in mussel abundance at the end of the colonization experiment enabled a gradual increase in diatom abundance and redevelopment of a three-dimensional autotrophic periphyton structure. Altogether, our re - sults showed that dense coverage of hard surfaces by mussels may have negatively influenced the algal community causing a significant decrease in algal abundance and a shift to the dominance of species resistant to the disturbance.

T1  - Diversity in riverine metacommunities: a network perspective
AN  - 1430900342
AB  - The influence of spatial processes on diversity and community dynamics is generally recognized in ecology and also applied to conservation projects involving forest and grassland ecosystems. Riverine ecosystems, however, have been for a long time viewed from a local or linear perspective, even though the treelike branching of river networks is universal. River networks (so-called dendritic networks) are not only structured in a hierarchic way, but the dendritic landscape structure and physical flows often dictate distance and directionality of dispersal. Theoretical models suggest that the specific riverine network structure directly affects diversity patterns. Recent experimental and comparative data are supporting this idea. Here, I provide an introduction on theoretical findings suggesting that genetic diversity, heterozygosity and species richness are higher in dendritic systems compared to linear or two-dimensional lattice landscapes. The characteristic diversity patterns can be explained in a network perspective, which also offers universal metrics to better understand and protect riverine diversity. I show how appropriate metrics describing network centrality and dispersal distances are superior to classic measures still applied in aquatic ecology, such as Strahler order or Euclidian distance. Finally, knowledge gaps and future directions of research are identified. The network perspective employed here may help to generalize findings on riverine biodiversity research and can be applied to conservation and river restoration projects.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The introduction of Littorina littorea to British Columbia, Canada: potential impacts and the importance of biotic resistance by native predators
AN  - 1369620568
AB  - Although the establishment and spread of non-indigenous species depends upon survival in the face of novel environmental conditions and novel biological interactions, relatively little attention has been focused on the specific role of native predators in limiting invasion success. The European common periwinkle, Littorina littorea, was recently introduced to the Pacific coast of Canada and provides a case study of an introduction into an area with an important predator guild (sea stars) that is functionally minor in the invader's native habitat. Here, we assess the likelihood of establishment, spread, and negative ecological impact of this introduced gastropod, with an emphasis on the role of native sea stars as agents of biotic resistance. Size frequency distributions and local market availability suggest that L. littorea was most likely introduced via the live seafood trade. Non-native hitchhikers (e.g., the trematode Cryptocotyle lingua) were found on/in both market and field specimens. Laboratory studies and field observations confirmed that L. littorea can survive seasonal low salinity in Vancouver, British Columbia. Periwinkles also readily consumed native Ulva, suggesting that periwinkles could impact native communities via herbivory or resource competition. Unlike native gastropods, however, L. littorea lacked behavioural avoidance responses to Northeast Pacific predatory sea stars (Pisaster ochraceus and Pycnopodia helianthoides), and sea star predation rates on L. littorea were much higher than predation rates on native turban snails (Chlorostoma funebralis) in common garden experiments. We therefore expect periwinkle establishment in British Columbia to be limited to areas with low predator density, as is seen in its field distribution to date. We caution that this conclusion may understate the importance of the L. littorea introduction if it also serves as a vector for additional non-indigenous species such as C. lingua.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Tributyltin in marine sediments and Philippine green mussels (Perna viridis) in Manila Bay
AN  - 1355876461
AB  - Tributyltin (TBT) is a pollutant, mainly introduced to the environment as insecticides, fungicides, bactericides, wood preservatives and marine antifouling agent. Concentrations of TBT and its degradation products were isolated from the bivalve Perna viridis and marine sediments collected from selected coastal areas along Manila Bay. In all samples, the extremely toxic TBT compound was detected, calculated as Sn. In sediments, measured concentration ranged from the limit of detection of 0.5 to 9.0 ng Sn g^sup -1^. Highest levels of TBT were observed at the inner and northern part of the bay, adjacent to coastal areas of varying land and water use (i.e., aquaculture, fishpond, mangrove forests, industrial establishments, and ports). However, the levels decrease near the bay entrance. Accumulation in this area can also be deduced from the movement of the prevailing wind and hydrodynamic behavior of the bay during the time of sampling, which transports suspended sediments from the eastern coast of Manila to the northern coast of Bulacan. In green mussels, the levels of TBT ranged from 2.1 to 8.9 ng Sn g^sup -1^. While these values are relatively low, concentrations as low as 0.659 ng Sn g^sup -1^ have been reported to be toxic to molluscs. The environmental levels of organotin species determined in the samples are comparatively low by global standards. Nevertheless, there is a need to estimate the levels of TBT in coastal waters and its associated uses, to evaluate the effectiveness of imposed regulation prohibiting the application of organotin compounds (OTs) as biocides in antifouling agents on ships and aquaculture facilities.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Comparative study of the reproductive biology of two congeneric and introduced goby species: implications for management strategies
AN  - 1326315651
AB  - A full understanding of life history characteristics of invasive species is a fundamental prerequisite for the development of management strategies. Two introduced goby species (Rhinogobius cliffordpopei and Rhinogobius giurinus) have established highly abundant populations in Lake Erhai (China). In the present study, we examined the reproductive biology of these two species with the aim of improving the efficiency of management strategy. The results indicated that R. cliffordpopei spawned from February to June, whereas R. giurinus spawned from April to August. Rhinogobius cliffordpopei showed higher gonado-somatic indices and had larger eggs than R. giurinus. The adult sex ratio of R. cliffordpopei was female skewed, but that of R. giurinus was equal. Rhinogobius cliffordpopei showed a male-skewed sexual size dimorphism, whereas the body size of R. giurinus varied only slightly between males and females. The different reproductive traits appear as a crucial biologic aspect for developing control programs. Specifically, control measures should be implemented and/or intensified from September to February for R. cliffordpopei and from January to April for R. giurinus. The body size of the smaller R. cliffordpopei females is the determinant for minimal mesh size of the nets used in physical removals of R. cliffordpopei.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Harmful Cyanobacterial Blooms: Causes, Consequences, and Controls
AN  - 1346496205; 23314096
AB  - Cyanobacteria are the Earth's oldest oxygenic photoautotrophs and have had major impacts on shaping its biosphere. Their long evolutionary history (3.5 by) has enabled them to adapt to geochemical and climatic changes, and more recently anthropogenic modifications of aquatic environments, including nutrient over-enrichment (eutrophication), water diversions, withdrawals, and salinization. Many cyanobacterial genera exhibit optimal growth rates and bloom potentials at relatively high water temperatures; hence global warming plays a key role in their expansion and persistence. Bloom-forming cyanobacterial taxa can be harmful from environmental, organismal, and human health perspectives by outcompeting beneficial phytoplankton, depleting oxygen upon bloom senescence, and producing a variety of toxic secondary metabolites (e.g., cyanotoxins). How environmental factors impact cyanotoxin production is the subject of ongoing research, but nutrient (N, P and trace metals) supply rates, light, temperature, oxidative stressors, interactions with other biota (bacteria, viruses and animal grazers), and most likely, the combined effects of these factors are all involved. Accordingly, strategies aimed at controlling and mitigating harmful blooms have focused on manipulating these dynamic factors. The applicability and feasibility of various controls and management approaches is discussed for natural waters and drinking water supplies. Strategies based on physical, chemical, and biological manipulations of specific factors show promise; however, a key underlying approach that should be considered in almost all instances is nutrient (both N and P) input reductions; which have been shown to effectively reduce cyanobacterial biomass, and therefore limit health risks and frequencies of hypoxic events.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Impacts of excessive dietary phosphorus on zebra mussels
AN  - 1317144475
AB  - Stoichiometric theory predicts that organisms should experience dietary imbalances not only when nutrients (e.g., phosphorus, P) are limiting relative to carbon (C), but also when nutrients are in excess (i.e., well above somatic demand). Nevertheless, few experiments have elucidated the response of consumers in such low C:P conditions. We assessed the growth, tissue stoichiometry, and nutrient excretion of the invasive primary consumer, zebra mussel (ZM), Dreissena polymorpha, under three dietary C:P conditions (C:PÂ =Â 20, 45, 380) in the laboratory. The two low C:P conditions represent increasingly common eutrophic systems, while the high C:P treatment is representative of oligotrophic systems. Growth rates and condition were lower when ZMs were fed a low C:P (20 and 45) diet, compared to the C:PÂ =Â 380 treatment, wherein ZMs grew rapidly and exhibited lower somatic C:P. Furthermore, ZMs in the C:PÂ =Â 20 and C:PÂ =Â 45 treatments excreted more ammonia indicative of protein catabolism. These results clearly show that hypereutrophic conditions invoke significant shifts in physiology, growth, and condition of ZMs. Together, these results are consistent with stoichiometric theory that predicts costs associated with the intake of excess dietary P.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Living at the edge of the front; reduced predation risk to invasive round goby in a Great Lakes tributary
AN  - 1317140095
AB  - The objective of this research was to determine if the highly invasive round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) experiences lower predation risk during early stages of invasion. We compared round goby predation rates between a recently invaded area (occupied for â[per thousand] 1Â year) and a longer established area (â[per thousand] 7Â years) of the Trent River, Ontario, Canada. Tethering trials were conducted in three habitat types, and comparable habitats in the two areas were similar in water temperature, velocity and depth. Predation rates of tethered round gobies were on average 27% lower in the recently invaded area. Reduced predation in the recently invaded area may be due to the short duration of round goby occupancy and/or differences in predator communities between the two study areas. Data before the round goby invasion suggest that predator communities were similar between the two range areas, but differences in predator abundance cannot be ruled out as a potential mechanism. Other possible mechanisms include a numerical or learned response by predators over time to a novel prey item. Reduced predation rate during the initial stages of invasion may contribute to the fitness of individuals that migrate into areas not previously occupied, and thus facilitate successful range expansion.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Evaluating the combined threat of climate change and biological invasions on endangered species
AN  - 1627952386; 20945244
AB  - Climate change and invasive species are two major biodiversity threats expected to provoke extinctions of many species in the future. This study evaluates the joint threat posed by climate change and two invasive species: the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) and the signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus), on the distribution of two endangered freshwater species: the depressed river mussel (Pseudanodonta complanata) and the white-clawed crayfish (Austropotamobius pallipes), at the scale of Europe. We expected the native species to experience a gradual contraction over time in their geographic range size, while the invasive species would maintain or increase their spread; therefore, their overlap would increase, further threatening the conservation of the native species. To test these three hypotheses, ensemble species distribution models (SDMs) were calibrated with current distributions and projected onto present and 2050 future climatic scenarios. In agreement with our expectations, the 2050 scenarios suggested D. polymorpha may strongly benefit from climate changes (increase of 15-20% in range size), while the depressed river mussel would experience a considerable loss (14-36%), the overlap between both mussels increasing up to 24%. Although both crayfishes were predicted to be negatively affected by climate changes, the contraction was more severe for the invasive P. leniusculus (up to 32% decrease in range size). Moreover, the overlap between both crayfishes decreased by 13-16%, which may reduce the pressure upon the native A. pallipes. This study illustrates how SDMs can assist in management of endangered species over large spatial and temporal scales by identifying current and future areas of shared bioclimatic suitability and potential refugia.

T1  - Paving the way for the new generations: Astarte borealis population dynamics in the White Sea
AN  - 1314063001
AB  - Issue Title: Long-term research on marine ecosystems in the White Sea, Russia

              
Populations of marine bivalves are known to be unstable but it is unclear whether this instability has internal or external causes. In this paper we summarize results from long-term (1978â[euro]"2007) monitoring of an AstarteÂ borealis (Astartidae) population in the White Sea. We sought significant long-term changes among a population of subtidal clams existing under relatively stable conditions. The studied population was initially (in 1978â[euro]"1995) formed exclusively by adult clams, with no recruitment occurring until a mass inflow of unidentified astartidâ[euro](TM)s juveniles in the late 1990s. We assessed the suitability of periostracum microsculpture for identification of astartid juveniles and identified the juveniles recruited the population as A. borealis. Thus significant changes in population structure were detected. Our study suggests that A. borealis may have a very long life span (>20Â years) and a prolonged recruitment failure could be associated with scarcity of hard substrates needed for egg attachment in a silted environment. As old clams died, their valves provided a hard substrate on the bottom surface, facilitating recruitment. We propose a new conceptual model of subtidal clamsâ[euro](TM) population dynamics predicting long-term cyclic changes driven by internal mechanisms associated with an unusual type of positive influence of adults upon recruits.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - SPECIES DIVERSITY, GENETIC DIVERSITY, AND HABITAT IN LAKE HURON
AN  - 1431403214
AB  - Progress in achieving the fish-community objectives (FCOs) during this reporting period (2005-2010) will be addressed for the major nearshore species and groups of species specified in DesJardine et al (1995). Surveys and data series dealing with nearshore fish communities in Lake Huron are generally focused on specific embayments, in particular Saginaw Bay, and relatively little is known about most of the nearshore area in the lake's main basin. Walleye yield during 2005-2010 increased substantially lakewide to 0.37-million kg, a 59% increase from 2000-2004. The increase is credited to a series of strong year-classes in Saginaw Bay and elsewhere around the lake. The increased reproductive success has been attributed to the decline of the alewife in Lake Huron. Commercial harvest of walleye from Ontario waters of Lake Huron during 2005-2010 averaged 0.92-million kg, a 7% increase compared to 2000-2004.

T1  - LAKE HURON IN 2010 AND BEYOND
AN  - 1431403202
AB  - Lake Huron has undergone a number of profound ecological changes in the last century, but particularly just before the late 1950s due to dominance of three invasive fishes (sea lamprey, alewife, and rainbow smelt), overfishing, and habitat degradation. Nutrient levels and lower-trophic communities in Lake Huron have continued to show major changes since the end of the last reporting period. Before 2005, offshore phosphorus levels and chlorophyll concentrations had declined, spring Secchi depth had increased, and zooplankton communities had exhibited marked changes, including a drastic reduction in the abundance of cladocerans. Trends in offshore prey-fish populations observed in the previous reporting period (2000-2004) have continued into this reporting period. Total estimated lakewide biomass of offshore demersal fish reached the lowest level ever observed in 2004, continued to decline through 2009, and increased modestly in 2010. The alewife population collapsed in 2004 and remains at very low levels, while abundance of rainbow smelt in this reporting period continued to decline beyond the already relatively low levels observed in 2004.

T1  - INTRODUCTION
AN  - 1431403186
AB  - Fish-community objectives (FCOs) for Lake Huron (DesJardine et al. 1995) were established by the Lake Huron Committee (LHC) in response to the 1994 modification of A Joint Strategic Plan for Management of Great Lakes Fisheries (Joint Plan) (Great Lakes Fishery Commission 2007).  A bottom-up approach is taken in this report-subsequent chapters address in order the status of lower trophic levels, the offshore demersal fish community, whitefishes and ciscoes, lake trout, sea lamprey, introduced salmonines, nearshore fish communities, habitat, and species and genetic diversity.

T1  - Changes in zooplankton community structure associated with the disappearance of invasive alewife in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron
AN  - 1315216106
AB  - We evaluated the response of the zooplankton community Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron to the disappearance of the planktivore alewife Alosa pseudoharengus using data collected in 1991â[euro]"1996 (pre alewife decline) and 2009â[euro]"2010 (post alewife decline). Bosmina longirostris, Diaptomidae, Cyclops, and Daphnia galeata contributed greatly to the separation of the two time periods with Diaptomidae and D. galeata increasing and Cyclops and B. longirostris decreasing, although B. longirostris remained the dominant species. Peak densities of zooplankton occurred in early summer (June) in the 1990s and in early fall (October) in 2009â[euro]"2010. For the analysis of environmental variables on a bay-wide, annual basis, abundance of alewife, age-0 yellow perch Perca flavescens and Bythotrephes captured much of the variation in annual zooplankton community structure. Abundances of Bythotrephes and age-0 yellow perch were both higher in 2009â[euro]"2010 than in 1991â[euro]"1996. Some changes such as increasing proportions of calanoid copepods reflect a more oligotrophic community and are potentially indicative of resource-driven changes rather than direct or indirect impacts of the alewife disappearance.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Towards the conservation of freshwater fish: Iberian Rivers as an example of threats and management practices
AN  - 1288296900
AB  - The current freshwater fish fauna crisis is such that natural resource managers urgently need to identify priorities and understand the management consequences of actions aimed at maximizing the preservation of biodiversity. Freshwater research is often poorly linked to conservation ecology; and interdisciplinary studies illustrating examples of freshwater ecosystem conservation are scarce. The Iberian Peninsula has a long history of anthropogenic disturbance that has led to the poor conservation status of its ichthyofauna, with 52 % of species now catalogued as critically endangered, endangered or vulnerable, according to UICN criteria. This paper gives an overview of the main threats (habitat degradation, hydrological alterations and exotic species) that have altered the function and connectivity of Iberian rivers. Case-study examples are provided to analyse the repercussions of these threats and the management actions planned or already performed in these systems. The interaction of many threats is responsible for native fish decline. However, freshwater managers and researchers should not let the trees prevent them from seeing the overall wood, when seeking to achieve practical solutions with the best balanced cost benefit and the collaboration of all ecosystem researchers and stakeholders. Conservation efforts should be focused on the preservation of ecological processes, in order to achieve the goals of the Water Framework Directive and guarantee the conservation of Iberian native fish species.

T1  - Nutritional ecology of the invasive freshwater mysid Limnomysis benedeni: field data and laboratory experiments on food choice and juvenile growth
AN  - 1287323933
AB  - The introduction of alien species leads to changes in species composition and therefore the trophic structure. The highly invasive freshwater mysid Limnomysis benedeni is established and abundant in Lake Constance since 2006. Our aim was to confirm the assumption that L. benedeni feds on small particles and to identify their food web position. We examined the feeding mode and food preference of adult L. benedeni collected from the field and from laboratory feeding experiments by analysing their stomach contents. Stable isotope analyses (SIA) confirm an omnivorous feeding of L. benedeni. In laboratory growth experiments, we determined the growth of juveniles by feeding juveniles with different natural food sources. Growth was supported by natural biofilm, dreissenid biodeposited material and an algal suspension. Stomach analyses showed clearly that L. benedeni fed on small particles of both benthic and pelagic origin and fed by both filtering and grazing. Absence of high numbers of animal structures in the stomachs and SIA supported the lack of predatory impact in the field, but the mysid probably affects the nutrient cycles in the littoral. L. benedeni seems to play an important role in the trophic relations in Lake Constance and all other water bodies they invaded.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The development of robust morphometric indices from accurate and precise measurements of free-swimming whale sharks using laser photogrammetry
AN  - 1284604031
AB  - To enable the study of population dynamics of wild animals the determination of the age, growth rate and maturity status of a sample of the individuals present is required; consequently, obtaining repeated accurate and precise total length (TL) measurements for individuals over time can be especially valuable. However, there are limited easily applied methods to ascertain the TL of large free-swimming fish, especially the largest extant species of fish, the whale shark (Rhincodon typus). This study expands on previous work and presents the results of a robust laser photogrammetry system developed to achieve accurate TL, pre-caudal length (PCL) and further morphometric measurements of whale sharks observed between 2009 and 2011 in seasonal feeding aggregations located in the Seychelles and Djibouti. Calculations for repeatability (r) indicated a high level of precision for the system with r approaching 1 for both TL and PCL, increasing further with the use of morphometric measurements. TL measurements of 'straight sample sharks' also provided geometric mean linear regression equations to enable the prediction of TL from defined morphological indices. Continuous validation of the system against objects of a fixed length also indicated a high level of accuracy for the method of measurement. We concluded that the laser photogrammetry system can be confidently employed to obtain accurate in-water TL, PCL and morphometric measurements for R. typus, with wide ranging implications and applications for the study of R. typus, and other large marine fauna.

T1  - Comparative feeding ecology of invasive Ponto-Caspian gobies
AN  - 1266639919
AB  - Invasions of Ponto-Caspian gobiid fishes are suspected to cause regime shifts in freshwater ecosystems. This study compared the trophic niche differentiations of Neogobius melanostomus and Ponticola kessleri in the upper Danube River using stable isotope analyses (δ^sup 13^C and δ^sup 15^N), gut content analyses and morphometric analyses of the digestive tract. Both species were identified as predacious omnivores with high dietary overlap and a generalistic feeding strategy. Amphipods (especially invasive Dikerogammarus spp.) contributed 2/3 to the index of food importance. δ^sup 15^N-signatures of N. melanostomus revealed an ontogenetic diet shift and significantly exceeded those in P. kessleri by ~1.5[per thousand], indicating a niche separation of half a trophic level. P. kessleri had shorter uncoiled intestinal tracts than N. melanostomus, indicating a narrower niche and adaptation to animal food. Trophic niches in both species expanded during the growth period with increasing intraguild predation and cannibalism in P. kessleri and increasing molluscivory in N. melanostomus. P. kessleri showed a higher degree of specialization and more stable feeding patterns across seasons, whereas N. melanostomus adapted its diet according to the natural prey availability. The feeding patterns of both species observed in the upper Danube River strongly differ from those in their native ranges, underlining their great plasticity. Both goby species consumed mainly other non-native species (~92% of gut contents) and seemed to benefit from previous invasions of prey species like Dikerogammarus villosus. The invasive success of gobies and their prey mirror fundamental ecological changes in large European freshwater ecosystems.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - DNA-based species detection capabilities using laser transmission spectroscopy
AN  - 1551641912; 20367118
AB  - Early detection of invasive species is critical for effective biocontrol to mitigate potential ecological and economic damage. Laser transmission spectroscopy (LTS) is a powerful solution offering real-time, DNA-based species detection in the field. LTS can measure the size, shape and number of nanoparticles in a solution and was used here to detect size shifts resulting from hybridization of the polymerase chain reaction product to nanoparticles functionalized with species-specific oligonucleotide probes or with the species-specific oligonucleotide probes alone. We carried out a series of DNA detection experiments using the invasive freshwater quagga mussel (Dreissena bugensis) to evaluate the capability of the LTS platform for invasive species detection. Specifically, we tested LTS sensitivity to (i) DNA concentrations of a single target species, (ii) the presence of a target species within a mixed sample of other closely related species, (iii) species-specific functionalized nanoparticles versus species-specific oligonucleotide probes alone, and (iv) amplified DNA fragments versus unamplified genomic DNA. We demonstrate that LTS is a highly sensitive technique for rapid target species detection, with detection limits in the picomolar range, capable of successful identification in multispecies samples containing target and non-target species DNA. These results indicate that the LTS DNA detection platform will be useful for field application of target species. Additionally, we find that LTS detection is effective with species-specific oligonucleotide tags alone or when they are attached to polystyrene nanobeads and with both amplified and unamplified DNA, indicating that the technique may also have versatility for broader applications.

T1  - Information in support of a recovery potential assessment of Hickorynut (Obovaria olivaria) in Canada.
TT  - Information a l'appui de l'evaluation du potentiel de retablissement de l'obovarie olivatre (Obovaria olivaria) au Canada.
AN  - 1642628421; 21202156
AB  - In May 2011, the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) assessed the status of Hickorynut (Obovaria olivaria) and determined the designation to be Endangered. The reason provided for this designation is that, "This freshwater mussel lives in mid-sized to large rivers in southern Ontario and Quebec. There has been an historical decline in the species' distribution with losses of the populations in the Detroit and Niagara rivers. Other locations are threatened by the continuing invasion of dreissenid mussels. In addition, the one known host of this mussel, the Lake Sturgeon, is at risk and may be declining in some locations where the mussel is known to still occur. The species is also affected by degraded water quality in many freshwater systems in southern Ontario and Quebec". Hickorynut is currently not listed under the Species at Risk Act (SARA). The Recovery Potential Assessment (RPA) provides information and scientific advice needed to fulfill various requirements of SARA, including informing both scientific and socio-economic elements of the listing decision and permitting activities that would otherwise violate SARA prohibitions and the development of recovery strategies. This Research Document describes the current state of knowledge of the biology, ecology, distribution, population trends, habitat requirements, and threats to Hickorynut. Mitigation measures and alternative activities related to the identified threats, which can be used to protect the species, are also presented. The information contained in the RPA and this document may be used to inform the development of recovery documents and for assessing permits, agreements and related conditions, as per section 73, 74, 75, 77 and 78 of SARA. The scientific information also serves as advice to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) regarding the listing of the species under SARA and is used when analyzing the socio-economic impacts of adding the species to the list as well as during subsequent consultations, where applicable. This assessment considers the available scientific data with which to assess the recovery potential of Hickorynut in Canada.Original Abstract: En mai 2011, le Comite sur la situation des especes en peril au Canada (COSEPAC) a evalue la situation de l'obovarie olivatre (Obovaria olivaria) et lui a attribue le statut d'espece en voie de disparition. La raison invoquee pour cette designation etait la suivante : 'Cette moule d'eau douce vit dans les moyennes et les grandes rivieres du sud de l'Ontario et du Quebec. Il y a eu un declin historique de la repartition de l'espece incluant la perte des populations dans les rivieres Detroit et Niagara. D'autres localites sont menacees par l'invasion continue des dreissenides. De plus, l'hote connu de cette moule, l'esturgeon jaune, est en peril et pourrait etre en declin dans certaines localites que l'on sait encore frequentees par la moule. L'espece est egalement touchee par la degradation de la qualite de l'eau dans bon nombre de reseaux dulcicoles du sud de l'Ontario et du Quebec.' A l'heure actuelle, l'obovarie olivatre n'est pas inscrite sur la liste de la Loi sur les especes en peril (LEP). L'evaluation du potentiel de retablissement (EPR) fournit les renseignements et les avis scientifiques necessaires pour satisfaire a diverses exigences de la LEP; notamment, cette evaluation permet d'eclairer les aspects scientifiques et socioeconomiques de la decision relative a l'inscription sur la liste, de realiser des activites qui autrement enfreindraient les interdictions de la LEP et d'elaborer des strategies de retablissement. Le present document de recherche fournit une description de l'etat actuel des connaissances de la biologie, de l'ecologie, de la repartition, des tendances demographiques, des besoins en matiere d'habitat et des menaces relatives a l'obovarie olivatre. Des mesures d'attenuation et d'autres activites associees aux menaces identifiees, qui peuvent etre utilisees dans le but de proteger l'espece, sont egalement presentees. Les renseignements que renferment l'EPR et ce document peuvent servir de base a l'elaboration de documents relatifs au retablissement et a l'evaluation des permis, des ententes et des conditions connexes, conformement aux articles 73, 74, 75, 77 et 78 de la LEP. On se sert egalement de ces renseignements scientifiques pour conseiller le ministre de Peches et Oceans Canada (MPO) au sujet de l'inscription de l'espece en vertu de la LEP, analyser les repercussions socioeconomiques de l'inscription de l'espece sur la liste ainsi que pour les consultations subsequentes, le cas echeant. Cette evaluation tient compte de toutes les donnees scientifiques existantes permettant d'evaluer le potentiel de retablissement de l'obovarie olivatre au Canada.

T1  - Tracking the distribution of non-native marine invertebrates (Mytella charruana, Perna viridis and Megabalanus coccopoma) along the south-eastern USA
AN  - 1477192755
AB  - Our study tracked three non-native, marine, sessile, invertebrate species which have recently colonized the south-eastern United States Atlantic coastlines and estuaries: Mytella charruana, the charru mussel; Perna viridis, the Asian green mussel; and Megabalanus coccopoma, the titan acorn barnacle. Along the eastern Floridian coast, Mytella charruana was discovered in the Indian River Lagoon, Florida (FL) in 2004. Perna viridis was found in Ponce de Leon Inlet, FL in 2002, after being introduced to Tampa Bay, FL in 1989. Megabalanus coccopoma was documented in St Augustine, FL and Brunswick, Georgia in 2006. From 2006 through to 2011, a biannual survey of the south-eastern Atlantic coastlines and estuaries was conducted from Jupiter, Florida to Charleston, South Carolina (894 km) to document the distribution and range expansion of M. charruana, P. viridis and M. coccopoma. Field surveys were conducted in June and December each year at 82 sites (e.g. docks, boat ramps, jetties and mangrove roots). The ranges of the three invertebrates have expanded and retracted along the Atlantic coast since the survey began. Mytella charruana had spread as far north as Savannah, Georgia in 2007, but the species was absent from northern Georgia in 2010 and 2011. Perna viridis and M. coccopoma were present in Georgia in 2007, but were absent in the 2010 and 2011 surveys. These range fluctuations may be explained by extreme cold temperatures, which occurred during the 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 winters. The patterns observed with these three sessile invertebrates provide information regarding how non-native species disperse and establish in new locations. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Retrospective Analyses of Inputs of Municipal Wastewater Effluent and Coupled Impacts on an Urban Lake
AN  - 1427000218; 18350680
AB  - A retrospective review and analysis are presented of the evolution of treatment, point of discharge considerations, and constituent loading from the Metropolitan Syracuse Wastewater Treatment Plant (Metro), and the coupled water quality effects on the receiving urban lake (Onondaga Lake, New York) from the early 1970s to 2010. The analysis is based on long-term monitoring of the discharge, Onondaga Lake, and a nearby river system considered as a potential alternate to receive the effluent. The Metro discharge is extraordinarily large relative to the lake's hydrologic budget, representing approximately 25% of the total inflow, greater than for any other lake in the United States. The large loads of nitrogen and phosphorus received from the facility resulted in severe water quality effects in the lake during the early portion of record, including (1) violations of standards to protect against toxic effects of ammonia and nitrite, (2) violations of the water clarity standard for swimming safety, (3) exceedances of a limit for the summer average concentration of total phosphorus in the upper waters, and (4) lakewide violations of the oxygen standard during fall turnover. The effects of Metro were compounded by effects of discharges from soda ash/chlor-alkali and pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities. The sedimentary record of the lake indicates that even greater levels of cultural eutrophication prevailed before the monitoring commenced. Dramatic improvements in the water quality of the lake were achieved in recent years by implementing advanced treatment technologies. Exceedances of receiving water limits in the lake were eliminated, with the exception of the total phosphorus limit. A zebra mussel invasion compromised the oxygen resources and assimilative capacity of the nearby river for more than 15 years. This eliminated an option, previously supported by managers, of full diversion of the Metro effluent to the river.

T1  - Effects of flow restoration on mussel growth in a Wild and Scenic North American River
AN  - 1317994011
AB  - Doc number: 6

              
Abstract

              
Background: Freshwater mussels remain among the most imperiled species in North America due primarily to habitat loss or degradation. Understanding how mussels respond to habitat changes can improve conservation efforts. Mussels deposit rings in their shell in which age and growth information can be read, and thus used to evaluate how mussels respond to changes in habitat. However, discrepancies between methodological approaches to obtain life history information from growth rings has led to considerable uncertainty regarding the life history characteristics of many mussel species. In this study we compared two processing methods, internal and external ring examination, to obtain age and growth information of two populations of mussels in the St. Croix River, MN, and evaluated how mussel growth responded to changes in the operation of a hydroelectric dam.

              
Results: External ring counts consistently underestimated internal ring counts by 4 years. Despite this difference, internal and external growth patterns were consistent. In 2000, the hydroelectric dam switched from operating on a peaking schedule to run-of-the-river/partial peaking. Growth patterns between an upstream and downstream site of the dam were similar both before and after the change in operation. At the downstream site, however, older mussels had higher growth rates after the change in operation than the same sized mussels collected before the change.

              
Conclusions: Because growth patterns between internal and external processing methods were consistent, we suggest that external processing is an effective method to obtain growth information despite providing inaccurate age information. External processing is advantageous over internal processing due to its non-destructive nature. Applying this information to analyze the influence of the operation change in the hydroelectric dam, we suggest that changing to run-of-the-river/partial peaking operation has benefited the growth of older mussels below the dam.

T1  - Retrospective Analyses of Inputs of Municipal Wastewater Effluent and Coupled Impacts on an Urban Lake
AN  - 1268165480; 23409450
AB  - A retrospective review and analysis are presented of the evolution of treatment, point of discharge considerations, and constituent loading from the Metropolitan Syracuse Wastewater Treatment Plant (Metro), and the coupled water quality effects on the receiving urban lake (Onondaga Lake, New York) from the early 1970s to 2010. The analysis is based on long-term monitoring of the discharge, Onondaga Lake, and a nearby river system considered as a potential alternate to receive the effluent. The Metro discharge is extraordinarily large relative to the lake's hydrologic budget, representing approximately 25% of the total inflow, greater than for any other lake in the United States. The large loads of nitrogen and phosphorus received from the facility resulted in severe water quality effects in the lake during the early portion of record, including (1) violations of standards to protect against toxic effects of ammonia and nitrite, (2) violations of the water clarity standard for swimming safety, (3) exceedances of a limit for the summer average concentration of total phosphorus in the upper waters, and (4) lakewide violations of the oxygen standard during fall turnover. The effects of Metro were compounded by effects of discharges from soda ash/chlor-alkali and pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities. The sedimentary record of the lake indicates that even greater levels of cultural eutrophication prevailed before the monitoring commenced. Dramatic improvements in the water quality of the lake were achieved in recent years by implementing advanced treatment technologies. Exceedances of receiving water limits in the lake were eliminated, with the exception of the total phosphorus limit. A zebra mussel invasion compromised the oxygen resources and assimilative capacity of the nearby river for more than 15 years. This eliminated an option, previously supported by managers, of full diversion of the Metro effluent to the river. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - North Atlantic coastal lagoons: conservation, management and research challenges in the twenty-first century
AN  - 1266473386
AB  - Coastal lagoons provide socio-economically valuable ecosystem services and are important habitats for conservation. Rare around North Atlantic coastlines, they are increasingly threatened by climatic and anthropogenic stressors. Despite repeated calls at the end of the twentieth century for further research to be urgently undertaken to underpin management of these habitats and the rare, specialist species they support, progress on North Atlantic lagoons has apparently lagged behind other European lagoon types. In the context of increasing pressure on coastal resources, we summarise current ecological knowledge and consider contemporary issues, concepts and techniques to identify the conservation, management and research challenges that need to be addressed if North Atlantic lagoons are to be safeguarded and sustainably managed in the twenty-first century. Priority issues relate to the lack of scientific understanding of lagoon functioning and variability, and include the need for reliable identification and classification of the resource, assessing responses to anthropogenic impacts (notably climate change) and applying ecosystem-specific management and monitoring. Key recommendations are (i) specialised surveys that recognise the inherent dynamism of the environment and facilitate a more accurate description of the lagoonal resource and its ecology, and (ii) an ecocomplex approach for conservation and management that addresses coastal habitat connectivity.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Effect of substratum drying on the survival and migrations of Ponto-Caspian and native gammarids (Crustacea: Amphipoda)
AN  - 1266433764
AB  - Organisms inhabiting shallow near-shore waters are at risk of desiccation during water level fluctuations. Using laboratory experiments, we investigated the survival and behavioural defences of four freshwater amphipod species during substratum drying: three Ponto-Caspian invaders (Pontogammarus robustoides, Dikerogammarus haemobaphes and Dikerogammarus villosus) and the native Gammarus fossarum. We hypothesized that they would be able to survive air exposure events as well as to adjust their behaviour by following the decreasing water level and/or burying in the sediments. To test these hypotheses, we examined survival of each species on gradually drying sandy substratum as well as their horizontal and vertical migration behaviours. P. robustoides was most resistant to substratum drying and was the only species burying into the substratum. On the other hand, G. fossarum exhibited distinct horizontal migrations following the retreating waterline. These two species seem to be particularly well adapted to the drying environment. Defence mechanisms of D. haemobaphes and D. villosus were less efficient, though the former species also followed the retreating waterline to some extent. Our study demonstrates that exotic and native gammarids have several adaptations that enable them to invade and persist in habitats experiencing common water level fluctuations.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - CONCLUSIONS
AN  - 1312307712
AB  - When evaluating the status of Lake Michigan's fish-community objectives (FCOs) and the progress made toward achieving a desired state, the entirety of the FCOs, as described in Eshenroder et al. (1995), should be considered. In particular, Eshenroder et al. (1995), before describing specific objectives for the most important fishes (which have received the most attention), provided an overarching goal of maintaining the biological integrity of the system. In this concluding chapter, researchers, the Lake Michigan Committee, evaluate what has transpired during this reporting period, 2005-2010, in relation to specific objectives, as well as to the maintenance of biological integrity, all within the context of the ten guiding principles. Researchers also include three recommendations endorsed by the Lake Michigan Technical Committee, which may provide guidance for the achievement or maintenance of the specific objectives. Lastly, researchers offer their own considerations regarding the biological integrity of the Lake Michigan ecosystem and the impediments to the ultimate achievement of the FCOs.

AN  - 1312307703
AB  - Achieving those Inshore and Benthivore Objectives that were unmet may require modifying the management approach. For example, implementation of the previously developed DA model would formalize and improve management of yellow perch. For other fishes, adopting improved indicators that trigger management action would be beneficial. Inclusion of pre-recruit indexes in lake whitefish stock assessment models would improve management of this species, and management of most nearshore and benthivore species would be improved by adoption of comprehensive fish-health monitoring, including management triggers for emerging fish-health issues. By improving habitat (in combination with temporary supplementation of recruitment through techniques, such as streamside rearing) where degradation has depressed recruitment of inshore and benthivore fishes, good progress can be made towards achieving objectives. Improvement of fish passage for lake sturgeon would provide the greatest immediate dividends for this species as well as others. Additionally, wetland and river restoration activities would benefit a wide variety of species, including northern pike, muskellunge, and walleye.

AN  - 1312307636
AB  - This state of the lake (SOL) report for Lake Michigan provides nominal background information and focuses on changes and progress toward meeting the fish-community objectives (FCOs) during the years 2005-2010. Chapters were prepared by individuals with an intimate knowledge of assessment data, food-web dynamics, and management actions (e.g., sea lamprey treatments). Views presented in the chapters are those of the authors and not necessarily those of the Lake Michigan Committee. For further information on historical trends or broader background on the physical characteristics of Lake Michigan or its fish community, interested readers are encouraged to review the previous SOL reports for Lake Michigan (Holey and Trudeau 2005; Clapp and Horns 2008).

T1  - Invasion process of Limnoperna fortunei (Bivalvia: Mytilidae): the case of Uruguay River and emissaries of the Esteros del Ibera Wetland, Argentina
AN  - 1287988019
AB  - Limnoperna fortunei (Dunker, 1857), during its invasion process in South America, has caused severe impacts both on natural environments altering native biodiversity, ecosystem structure and function-, and on man-made structures causing economic looses. Twenty-one samples were taken from the right bank of the Uruguay River, from tributaries of the Uruguay and Paraná Rivers, the drainage of the Esteros del Ibera Wetland. Based on this fieldwork, the presence of larvae and adults of L. fortunei was determined. Also, through the comparison of environmental characteristic with the known tolerance limits for the species, the possibility of its establishment in environments not yet invaded was determined. Most of the sampling stations have features that allow the development of stable populations L. fortunei, including the rivers that drain the Esteros del Ibera, allowing access of this invasive species to this important wetland.

T1  - Drivers of change in estuarine-coastal ecosystems: Discoveries from four decades of study in San Francisco Bay
AN  - 1115668953
AB  - Poised at the interface of rivers, ocean, atmosphere and dense human settlement, estuaries are driven by a large array of natural and anthropogenic forces. San Francisco Bay exemplifies the fast-paced change occurring in many of the world's estuaries, bays, and inland seas in response to these diverse forces. We use observations from this particularly well-studied estuary to illustrate responses to six drivers that are common agents of change where land and sea meet: water consumption and diversion, human modification of sediment supply, introduction of nonnative species, sewage input, environmental policy, and climate shifts. In San Francisco Bay, responses to these drivers include, respectively, shifts in the timing and extent of freshwater inflow and salinity intrusion, decreasing turbidity, restructuring of plankton communities, nutrient enrichment, elimination of hypoxia and reduced metal contamination of biota, and food web changes that decrease resistance of the estuary to nutrient pollution. Detection of these changes and discovery of their causes through environmental monitoring have been essential for establishing and measuring outcomes of environmental policies that aim to maintain high water quality and sustain services provided by estuarine-coastal ecosystems. The many time scales of variability and the multiplicity of interacting drivers place heavy demands on estuarine monitoring programs, but the San Francisco Bay case study illustrates why the imperative for monitoring has never been greater.

T1  - Absence of sterols constrains food quality of cyanobacteria for an invasive freshwater bivalve
AN  - 1037312932; 22398861
AB  - The accumulation of cyanobacterial biomass may severely affect the performance of aquatic consumers. Here, we investigated the role of sterols in determining the food quality of cyanobacteria for the invasive clam Corbicula fluminea, which has become a common benthic invertebrate in many freshwater ecosystems throughout the world. In standardized growth experiments, juvenile clams were fed mixtures of different cyanobacteria (Anabaena variabilis, Aphanothece clathrata, Synechococcus elongatus) or sterol-containing eukaryotic algae (Cryptomonas sp., Nannochloropsis limnetica, Scenedesmus obliquus). In addition, the cyanobacterial food was supplemented with different sterols. We provide evidence that somatic growth of C. fluminea on cyanobacterial diets is constrained by the absence of sterols, as indicated by a growth-enhancing effect of sterol supplementation. Thus, our findings contribute to our understanding of the consequences of cyanobacterial mass developments for benthic consumers and highlight the importance of considering sterols as potentially limiting nutrients in aquatic food webs.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The fate of an immigrant: Ensis directus in the eastern German Bight
AN  - 1037275505
AB  - We studied Ensis directus in the subtidal (7-16 m depth) of the eastern German Bight. The jack-knife clam that invaded in the German Bight in 1978 has all characteristics of a successful immigrant: Ensis directus has a high reproductive capacity (juveniles, July 2001: Amrumbank 1,914 m^sup -2^, Eiderstedt/Vogelsand: 11,638 m^sup -2^), short generation times and growths rapidly: maximum growth rates were higher than in former studies (mean: 3 mm month^sup -1^, 2nd year: up to 14 mm month^sup -1^). Ensis directus uses natural mechanisms for rapid dispersal, occurs gregariously and exhibits a wide environmental tolerance. However, optimal growth and population-structure annual gaps might be influenced by reduced salinity: at Vogelsand (transition area of Elbe river), maximum growth was lower (164 mm) than at the Eiderstedt site (outer range of Elbe river, L ^sub ∞^ = 174 mm). Mass mortalities of the clams are probably caused by washout (video inspections), low winter temperature and strong storms. Ensis directus immigrated into the community finding its own habitat on mobile sands with strong tidal currents. Recent studies on E. directus found that the species neither suppresses native species nor takes over the position of an established one which backs up our study findings over rather short time scales. On the contrary, E. directus seems to favour the settlement of some deposit feeders. Dense clam mats might stabilise the sediment and function as a sediment-trap for organic matter. Ensis directus has neither become a nuisance to other species nor developed according to the 'boom-and-bust' theory. The fate of the immigrant E. directus rather is a story of a successful trans-ocean invasion which still holds on 23 years after the first findings in the outer elbe estuary off Vogelsand.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Lake charr Salvelinus namaycush spawning behaviour: new field observations and a review of current knowledge
AN  - 1037267755
AB  - In this paper, we (1) describe field observations of lake charr (trout) reproductive behaviour, focusing on two morphs from Great Bear Lake, N.T; (2) review and synthesize observations from the literature; and (3) summarize uncertainties and pose hypotheses regarding lake trout spawning behaviour. Our description is set within the context of an existing conceptual model that included three sequential stages to spawning behaviour--traveling, sinking, and gamete release. Spawning morphs did not overlap in time and space. Strong onshore winds seemed to trigger lake trout movement toward shoals in mid- to late-August where males outnumbered and seemed to precede female arrival at the shoals. A new behaviour termed finning was observed and interpreted as display courtship. Finning was observed at all spawning sites in Great Bear Lake and involved two or more fish that were either stationary or moving slowly just beneath the water surface with a partially erect dorsal fin, adipose fin, and only occasionally the dorsal lobe of the caudal fin breaking the water surface. On the basis of our observations and review of the literature, we propose to modify the Esteve et al. model to add (1) pre-courtship and spawning behaviour and (2) display courtship behaviour as occurring prior to traveling, sinking, and gamete release. Potential future research questions are described to address uncertainties regarding how spawning lake trout relate to their physical habitat, environmental cues to spawning, factors driving assortative mating among morphs, and the role of olfactory cues in spawning.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Does functional redundancy of communities provide insurance against human disturbances? An analysis using regional-scale stream invertebrate data
AN  - 1023286137
AB  - Human-induced reductions in species richness might alter the quality of ecosystem services when the remaining species are not able to substitute the functions provided by extirpated species. We examined how human disturbances (nutrient enrichment, land use intensification, instream habitat degradation and the presence of alien species) influence the species richness of stream invertebrates. Stream invertebrates (425 native species) were collected by kick and sweep sampling technique at 274 stream sites covering the entire area of Hungary. We measured the species richness, functional richness (i.e. number of unique functional roles provided by community members) and functional redundancy (i.e. the functional insurance of the community) using information on the feeding habits of each species. To remove the effect of natural variability, we tested the effect of stressors on the residuals of models relating species richness, functional richness and functional redundancy with natural environmental gradients. Our results showed that species richness was negatively influenced by instream habitat degradation and nutrient enrichment. Independent of the way of quantifying functional richness and functional redundancy, we found that functional richness is more sensitive to human impact than functional redundancy of stream invertebrates. The finding that a reduction of species richness is associated with a loss of unique functional roles (functional richness) is important for conservation issues, because the number of unique functional roles is usually regarded as driver of ecosystem functioning.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Feeding patterns and population structure of an invasive cyprinid, the rudd Scardinius erythrophthalmus (Cypriniformes, Cyprinidae), in Buffalo Harbor (Lake Erie) and the upper Niagara River
AN  - 1023286136
AB  - Feeding patterns and population structure of the non-native rudd Scardinius erythrophthalmus (Linnaeus) were examined to understand their ecology in Buffalo Harbor and the Niagara River. We hypothesized that (1) the diet of rudds would be omnivorous, but contain greater proportions of macrophytes in summer months, (2) feeding intensity would increase with water temperature, and (3) condition and growth would be similar to other populations. We collected rudds with a variety of gears in 2009 to test these hypotheses, and used data from 2007 to 2010 seining surveys to determine if the relative abundance of young-of-the-year rudd differed among sites with different flow conditions. Rudds were mostly herbivorous; they consumed aquatic macrophytes in summer and supplemented their diet with algae and fish in spring and fall. Feeding intensity was positively correlated with water temperature, but significantly reduced during spawning. Rudd condition and growth were greater than estimates from other populations, suggesting increases in abundance and range expansion are possible. Furthermore, reproduction was successful at lotic sites but very poor at sites without measureable flow, contrary to the paradigm of optimal rudd habitat. Research is needed to understand how herbivory by abundant rudd populations affects native aquatic communities.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The exotic aquatic mud snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum (Hydrobiidae, Mollusca): state of the art of a worldwide invasion
AN  - 1022246616
AB  - Biological invasions represent a relevant ecological and economic problem of our globalized world. While a few species have been classified as invasive due to their ecological and economic impacts on the invaded ecosystems (e.g., zebra mussel), others show contrasting invasive potential, depending on the invaded ecosystem and/or the traits of the exotic species. This paper reviews the worldwide distribution, ecological impacts and the reasons that explain the invasive success of the aquatic mud snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum Gray (Hydrobiidae, Mollusca), which is native to New Zealand. This review shows that most studies on P. antipodarum distribution have been conducted in Europe, North America and Australia, and few studies in Asia. The distribution of this snail is still unknown in other parts of the world (e.g., Africa, South and Central America). The range of invaded aquatic ecosystems varies from fresh to salt water and from lentic to lotic ecosystems. The ecological impact of this species is due to the fast population growth rate and to the extremely high densities that it can reach, leading to altered C and N cycles in invaded ecosystems. However, at low densities mud snails have been shown to enhance secondary production. Additionally, P. antipodarum has been found to overcome the negative effects of predators and parasites (e.g., it survives the pass through the digestive tracts of fish). This review contributes to assess the magnitude and ecological risk of P. antipodarum invasion throughout the world.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Oligotrophication from wetland epuration alters the riverine trophic network and carrying capacity for fish
AN  - 1022246591
AB  - Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) constitutes a major component of fish habitat, providing support for epiphytes and invertebrates as well as shelter from predators. The effects of wetland epuration from a mesotrophic to a nearly oligotrophic state were examined over a 15 km long reach of the St. Lawrence River under the direct influence of major farmland tributaries. We hypothesized that the nutrient-enriched zone would support a higher biomass of SAV, epiphytes, macroinvertebrates and fish than the nitrogen-deficient epurated zone located downstream of the wetland. Predictions included that the enriched habitat would support a richer fish assemblage, with higher biomass and growth of juvenile yellow perch than found in the epurated zone. Results supported these hypotheses, demonstrating the chain of effects of nutrient reduction on the biomass of SAV (fourfold drop), invertebrate prey (ninefold), small (threefold) and large (1.5-fold) fish between the two zones. In addition to the reduction in SAV biomass, the replacement of filamentous chlorophytes by benthic mats of filamentous cyanobacteria in the epurated zone resulted in a less complex 3-D habitat structure and a low invertebrate availability for fish. Oligotrophication by wetland epuration exerted negative effects on fish habitat quality, food quantity and availability, with an impairment of juvenile perch growth and recruitment. A generalized model of the changes in habitat carrying capacity occurring with epuration (oligotrophication) or eutrophication is presented, with examples of other aquatic systems in which strong linkages between trophic status, SAV, invertebrates and fish productivity were also demonstrated.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Variation of Antioxidant Activity in Dreissena polymorpha Specimens Exposed to 2,2',4,4',5,6'-Hexa BDE (BDE-154)
AN  - 1018636234
AB  - We evaluated the imbalance of the oxidative status in zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) specimens exposed for 96 h to environmentally relevant concentrations (0.1, 0.5, and 1 μg/L) of the 2,2',4,4',5,6'-hexa BDE (BDE-154). The activities of three antioxidant enzymes, catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and the phase II detoxifying enzyme glutathione S-transferase (GST), were measured in the cytosolic fraction from a pool of zebra mussels. Significant variations in the activity of each single enzyme were noticed at each treatment, indicating that exposure to BDE-154 was able to impair the oxidative status of treated bivalves through the increase of reactive oxygen species. In detail, SOD and GPx were significantly induced, while CAT and GST were depressed with respect to the baseline levels. These data have confirmed that the raise of oxidative stress is the main cause of the BDE-154-induced genetic damage observed in a previous study on the zebra mussel. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - A review on the "in vitro" culture of freshwater mussels (Unionoida)
AN  - 1016441764
AB  - Many Unionoida are considered to be extinct, endangered, or of special concern. These bivalves have complex life cycle stages that limit successful culture. In nature, the larvae (glochidia) of these bivalves must successfully parasitize a host (mainly fish) in order to metamorphose into juveniles. The two artificial methods used to obtain juvenile freshwater mussels in laboratory are either by induced attachment to host fish or by in vitro culture of glochidia. This article is focused on the in vitro method that represents a novel and alternative process to fish infestation, offering the ability to obtain larger numbers of juveniles without the need for host fishes and reducing the overall costs of propagation. In vitro culture requires a medium which fulfills the nutritional needs of each glochidia species and avoids microbial contamination. Recently, this methodology has presented excellent results with survival and transformation rates up to 94% using host fish plasma. High efficiencies on growth, and survival rates (84%) of juvenile freshwater bivalve Hyriopsis myersiana (Lea, 1856) up to 120 days were obtained when reared in adequate recirculating aquacultural systems using a very specific diet. More research is still needed to demonstrate successful propagation, mainly concerning the media nutritional composition to increase glochidia transformation and juvenile quality.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Range expansion dynamics of the invasive round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) in a river system
AN  - 1017931382
AB  - The rates of upstream and downstream range expansion of the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) were examined in the Trent-Severn Waterway in 2009 and 2010. Relative abundance, demographics, and habitat use were also compared between areas of range expansion and a longer established area to determine how these characteristics varied along the invasion pathway. Round gobies were sampled using an angling removal method in May and August of 2009 and 2010 at 75 sites at each area of range expansion and 25 sites near the center of their range where they first became established in the waterway. Areas of range expansion had initially low abundance and low site occupancy in May 2009 relative to the longer established area. Large increases in abundance and site occupancy were observed over the first summer of occupation, but with limited range expansion. Rapid range expansion was observed during the non-reproductive season at the upstream edge of range. Individuals sampled in the expanded upstream range were small and female biased relative to other range locations. Round gobies also exhibited higher habitat selectivity for rocky substrates at range edges than in the longer established area. These characteristics of seasonal dispersal, biased demographics of dispersers, and high habitat selectivity may be important components of successful range expansion of the round goby in invaded ecosystems.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Biological invasions and climatic warming: implications for south-eastern Aegean ecosystem functioning
AN  - 1011623800
AB  - The Aegean Sea, due to the complexity and variety of morphological features, bathymetry, hydrological, hydrodynamic features and climatic characteristics, offers a unique opportunity for monitoring the spreading and/or invasion of alien biota. It is known that the establishment of warm/tropical marine alien species is related mainly to the increase in sea temperature. A significant increase in aliens' number along the southern Aegean (Dodecanese) coasts has been documented in the last twenty years, while their arrival has produced evident changes in coastal ecosystem composition and function. Although the study area acts as a crossroad for tropical alien species introduction in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, a direct attempt to link temperature alterations with new alien species arrivals has not been performed. Satellite and in situ derived marine temperature data showed that the study area has gone through a remarkable warming, while the link between global temperatures and regional ones revealed that this warming is not a local phenomenon but part of global climate trends. Examining relationships between new alien species arrivals data since 1929 against global temperatures, it is shown that their introduction rate parallels the significant increase of marine temperatures. The association of alien introductions with marine water warming, as well as potential effects on ecosystem functioning of selected species is discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Genetic structure and differentiation at a short-time scale of the introduced calcarean sponge Paraleucilla magna to the western Mediterranean
AN  - 953496832
AB  - Issue Title: Ancient animals, new challenges: developments in sponge research

              
The allochthonous calcarean sponge Paraleucilla magna has proliferated in the western Mediterranean during the last decade, where it currently shows a highly patchy distribution with dense populations in the neighboring of sea farms and slightly eutrophised marinas, and more sparse populations in well-preserved habitats. To gain knowledge about the species invasive capacity, we studied spatial genetic differentiation and structure, clonality, and temporal differentiation, in three close populations of P. magna at the NE of the Iberian Peninsula, in three successive years. The study hypothesis was that the species is able to proliferate under favorable conditions in newly colonized habitats but populations can easily disappear where perturbations occur with some frequency. Samples were genotyped for nine polymorphic microsatellites. Spatial genetic structure was found in the three populations of 2006. One population disappeared in 2007, and the other two remained slightly differentiated, while the three populations were in place again in 2008, and showed very low (but significant) F ^sub ST^ values, and non-significant D values. Low but statistically significant differentiation also occurred for the three populations between years. Results showed high-allele diversity, but heterozygote deficit and changes in allele frequencies in the populations over the 3 years, which are consistent with some genetic drift. The whole population descriptors pointed to the species as a good opportunistic colonizer as it has been hypothesized, but highly sensitive to stochastic events affecting recruitment. This suggests a high impact of the species in favorable habitats (sea culture and sheltered zones) and a low-medium influence in native communities.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - One-year monitoring of core biomarker and digestive enzyme responses in transplanted zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha)
AN  - 929916727; 22252290
AB  - A 12-month active biomonitoring study was performed in 2008-2009 on the Vesle river basin (Champagne-Ardenne, France) using the freshwater mussel Dreissena polymorpha as a sentinel species; allochthonous mussels originating from a reference site (Commercy) were exposed at four sites (Bouy, Sept-Saulx, Fismes, Ardre) within the Vesle river basin. Selected core biomarkers (acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, glutathione-S transferase (GST) activity, metallothionein concentration), along with digestive enzyme activities (amylase, endocellulase) and energy reserve concentrations (glycogen, lipids), were monitored throughout the study in exposed mussels. At the Fismes and Ardre sites (downstream basin), metallic and organic contamination levels were low but still high enough to elicit AChE and GST activity induction in exposed mussels (chemical stress); besides, chemical pollutants had no apparent deleterious effects on mussel condition. At the Bouy and Sept-Saulx sites (upstream basin), mussels obviously suffered from adverse food conditions which seriously impaired individual physiological state and survival (nutritional stress); food scarcity had however no apparent effects on core biomarker responses. Digestive enzyme activities responded to both chemical and nutritional stresses, the increase in energy outputs (general adaptation syndrome--downstream sites) or the decrease in energy inputs (food scarcity--upstream sites) leading to mid- or long-term induction of digestive carbohydrase activities in exposed mussels (energy optimizing strategy). Complex regulation patterns of these activities require nevertheless the use of a multi-marker approach to allow data interpretation. Besides, their sensitivity to natural confounding environmental factors remains to be precised.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Habitat complexity: approaches and future directions
AN  - 922789830
AB  - Issue Title: The importance of habitat complexity in waterscapes              Habitat complexity is one of the most important factors structuring biotic assemblages, yet we still lack basic understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Although it is one of the primary targets in conservation management, no methods are available for comparing complexity across ecosystems, and system-specific qualitative assessment predominates. Despite its overwhelming importance for faunal diversity and abundance, there has been surprisingly little interest in examining its effects on other community and ecosystem attributes. We discuss possibilities of such effects, outlining potentially fruitful areas for future research, and argue that complexity may be implicated in community persistence and ecosystem stability by acting as a decoupling mechanism in predator-prey interactions. We provide a brief overview of methods used to quantify complexity in different ecosystems, highlighting contributions of the current issue of Hydrobiologia, and discuss potential application of these approaches for cross-ecosystem comparisons. Better understanding of the role of habitat complexity resulting from such comparisons is critically important for preservation of biodiversity and ecosystem function in an era of unprecedented habitat loss.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Dietary effects on fatty acid composition in muscle tissue of juvenile European eel, Anguilla anguilla (L.)
AN  - 921725958
AB  - The role of intracontinental migration patterns of European eel (Anguilla anguilla) receives more and more recognition in both ecological studies of the European eel and possible management measures, but small-scale patterns proved to be challenging to study. We experimentally investigated the suitability of fatty acid trophic markers to elucidate the utilization of feeding habitats. Eight groups of juvenile European eels were fed on eight different diets in a freshwater recirculation system at 20°C for 56 days. Three groups were fed on freshwater diets (Rutilus rutilus, Chironomidae larvae, and Gammarus pulex) and four groups were reared on diets of a marine origin (Clupea harengus, Crangon crangon, Mysis spec., and Euphausia superba) and one on commercial pellets used in eel aquaculture. Fatty acid composition (FAC) of diets differed significantly with habitat. FAC of eel muscle tissue seemed to be rather insensitive to fatty acids supplied with diet, but the general pattern of lower n3:n6 and EPA:ARA ratios in freshwater prey organisms could be traced in the respective eels. Multivariate statistics of the fatty acid composition of the eels resulted in two distinct groups representing freshwater and marine treatments. Results further indicate the capability of selectively restraining certain fatty acids in eel, as e.g. the n3:n6 ratio in all treatments was <4, regardless of dietary n3:n6. In future studies on wild eel, these measures can be used to elucidate the utilization of feeding habitats of individual European eel.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Sub-lethal effects induced by a mixture of three non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on the freshwater bivalve Dreissena polymorpha
AN  - 920995831; 21971971
AB  - Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the sixth top-selling drugs worldwide and are commonly found in freshwater ecosystems in the high ng/l to low μg/l range. Recent studies have investigated both the acute and the chronic toxicity of single NSAIDs on different biological models, but these studies have completely neglected the fact that, in the environment, non-target organisms are exposed to mixtures of drugs that have unforeseeable toxicological behavior. This work investigated the sub-lethal effects induced by a mixture of three common NSAIDs, namely, diclofenac, ibuprofen and paracetamol, on the freshwater bivalve, the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha). The mussels were exposed to three different environmental concentrations of the mixture (Low, Mid and High). A multi-biomarker approach was used to highlight cyto-genotoxic effects and the imbalance of the oxidative status of the treated specimens. The Neutral Red Retention Assay (NRRA) was used as a biomarker of cytotoxicity, whereas the activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione S-transferase were measured to assess the role played by the oxidative stress enzymes. In addition, the single cell gel electrophoresis assay, the DNA Diffusion assay and the micronucleus test were used to investigate possible genotoxic effects. According to our NRRA results, each treatment was able to induce a significant cellular stress in bivalves, probably due to the raise of oxidative stress, as indicated by the alteration of enzyme activities measured in treated specimens. Moreover, the mixture induced significant enhancements of DNA fragmentation, which preluded fixed genetic damage, as highlighted by the increase of both apoptotic and micronucleated cells.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Cross-effects of nickel contamination and parasitism on zebra mussel physiology
AN  - 920995633; 22076027
AB  - Aquatic organisms are exposed to pollution which may make them more susceptible to infections and diseases. The present investigation evaluated effects of nickel contamination and parasitism (ciliates Ophryoglena spp. and intracellular bacteria Rickettsiales-like organisms), alone and in combination, on biological responses of the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha, and also the infestation abilities of parasites, under laboratory controlled conditions. Results showed that after 48 h, more organisms were infected in nickel-exposed groups, which could be related to weakening of their immune system. Acting separately, nickel contamination and infections were already stressful conditions; however, their combined action caused stronger biological responses in zebra mussels. Our data, therefore, confirm that the parasitism in D. polymorpha represents a potential confounding factor in ecotoxicological studies that involve this bivalve.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AN  - 915064095; 21735200
AB  - Increased biological diversity due to invasion by non-indigenous species (NIS) is a global phenomenon with potential effects on trophic interactions and ecosystem processes in the invaded habitat. We assessed the effects of resource availability and invasion of three non-indigenous invertebrate grazers (two crustaceans and a snail) on secondary production, relative dominance of NIS grazers and resource depletion in experimental freshwater mesocosms. The relative dominance of NIS grazers increased with increasing initial resource availability, although the effect was largest for one of the three species. The effect was due to the fact that all the included non-indigenous grazers were able to expand their populations quickly in response to resource addition. For the most dominating species, the increased grazer diversity due to invasion in turn resulted in higher production of grazer biomass and a more efficient depletion of the periphyton resource. The effect was largest at high initial resource availability, where NIS dominance was most pronounced. Our results show that an invasion-induced increase in species diversity can increase resource depletion and consequently production, but that the effect depends on identity of the introduced species. The results also suggest that properties of the recipient system, such as resource availability, can modulate ecosystem effects of NIS by affecting invader success and dominance.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Slow, but steady: dispersal of freshwater molluscs
AN  - 913318771
AB  - Molluscs are the proverbial examples of slow movement. In this review, dispersal distances and speed were assessed from literature data. Active upstream movement can occur both individually and in groups; and depends on traits such as size, sex and reproductive status, and on external factors such as flow velocity, temperature, sediment structure, and food availability. The potential for active dispersal follows the sequence Pulmonata ≥ Prosobranchia > Bivalvia, although data for Pulmonata originated from short-term experiments that likely overestimated dispersal capabilities. Active upstream movement may be 0.3 to 1.0 km per year for most snails and is probably well below 0.1 km per year for bivalves. Natural passive upstream dispersal increases the range 10-fold (snails) to 100-fold (bivalves), and anthropogenic vectors can increase upstream dispersal more than 100-fold (snails) to 1000-fold (bivalves). Three km seems to be the maximal within-stream distance at which many species display regular population mixing, and at which re-colonisation or successful restoration can be expected within 3-10 years. Lateral dispersal between unconnected water bodies is passive and mostly known from observational reports, but potential distances depend on vectors, climate and geomorphology. In general, active dispersal seems insufficient to furnish a compensatory mechanism, e.g., for the rate of projected climate change. We provide an overview on dispersal strategies in the light of applied issues. More rigorous field surveys and an integration of different approaches (such as mark-recapture, genetic) to quantify distances and probabilities of lateral dispersal are needed to predict species distributions across space and time.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Alien molluscs affect the composition and diversity of native macroinvertebrates in a sandy flat of Lake Neuchatel, Switzerland
AN  - 906335445
AB  - The spread of alien molluscs is a serious threat to native biodiversity in fresh waters. Alien freshwater molluscs may deplete the resources of native species and alter the physical structure of the habitat through their shell mass. These changes might have both positive and negative effects on native community members. We investigated the native macroinvertebrate community in relation to the densities of four alien mollusc species (Corbicula fluminea, Dreissena polymorpha, Potamopyrgus antipodarum and Lithoglyphus naticoides) in a sandy flat of Lake Neuchâtel, Switzerland. The habitat examined was dominated by these alien mollusc species. The abundance of the alien molluscs did not directly impact the native community assembly. However, C. fluminea and D. polymorpha influenced the composition and diversity of native macroinvertebrates by transforming the sandy substratum into a partly hard substratum habitat. Substantial differences in community composition between shallow (<3.5 m) and (≥5 m) deep sites were recorded. At shallow sites, the abundance of D. polymorpha was significantly reduced as a result of depth-selective feeding of ducks. A controlled shell decay study revealed that shells of alien molluscs (C. fluminea, D. polymorpha) persist for a longer period in the sediment than those of native molluscs. Consequently, shells of alien molluscs have a long-lasting impact by modifying the sandy habitat. This form of ecosystem engineering favours the occurrence of several native taxa, but is disadvantageous for other taxa with specific habitat requirements, and thus can be regarded as an indirect impact of competition.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Ecological effects of multiple stressors on a deep lake (Lago Maggiore, Italy) integrating neo and palaeolimnological approaches
AN  - 2417740845
AB  - To understand interactions of lake physical characteristics, trophic dynamics and climate in Lago Maggiore, we compare longterm limnological and meteorological monitoring data and results from sediment cores. We include analyses of nutrients, pigments, diatoms and cladoceran microfossils. Over the past decades, caloric content increased. Eutrophication from the 1960s to early 1980s was followed by oligotrophication. DDTs, PCBs and Hg showed high contamination in the ‘60s, compared to point source inputs in the ‘90s. Algal biomass was predicted by total pigments and some algal specific carotenoids. Following nutrient enrichment, Chydorus sphaericus, and total abundance of cladocerans changed inversely with trophic status. Fewer large Daphnia since the late ‘80s matched an increase in with subfossil Eubosmina mucro lengths. Both were explained by the 10-fold increase in Bythotrephes longimanus from 1987 to 1993, when an increase of its mean annual population density occurred during warmer winter and springs. Bythotrephes remained abundant and further increased during the following 10 years as water temperature increased. We conclude that warmer water affects food chains indirectly by changing habitat use and predator-prey interactions. Relative abundances of Daphnia and its peak population density in the warm year of the oligotrophic period (2003) were close to the record from the mesotrophic period in 1982, supporting the hypothesis that warming can produce a eutrophication-like signal. The study illustrates the complexity of biological responses to synchronous changes in multiple drivers (e.g., eutrophication, fish introduction, ban of fish harvesting, chemical pollution, and climate) and, despite this complexity, how Lago Maggiore responded to multiple stressors.

T1  - Benthic communities on hard substrates covered by Limnoperna fortunei Dunker (Bivalvia, Mytilidae) at an estuarine beach (Río de la Plata, Argentina)
AN  - 2417740622
AB  - The structure and composition of benthic communities on hard substrates covered by the nonindigenous bivalve Limnoperna fortunei Dunker, the golden mussel, were quantified in the middle zone of the Río de la Plata Estuary (Argentina) from April 2001 through March 2002. A total of 26 taxa were recorded. L. fortunei and Nematoda were the central and dominant groups, with a prodigious abundance of over 80%. The prevalence of L. fortunei, rather than the environmental variables, regulated the dynamics of the associated invertebrate fauna. The golden mussel alters both the structure and function of benthic native communities on hard substrates, allows a higher surface available for colonization and refuge, and provides food source to deposit-feeding organisms in the form of organic or residual material. The mussel also increases the abundance and diversity of taxa on hard substrata - such as Oligochaeta, Hirudinea, Tardigrada, Chironomidae, Copepoda, Tanaidacea, and Hydrachnidia. Similarities and nonparametric multidimensional-scaling analyses indicated that the benthic composition had a seasonal variation. L. fortunei has an environmental impact, an ability to invade new freshwater ambiences worldwide and ecological characteristic comparable to those of Dreissena polymorpha Pallas (the zebra mussel) of North America and Europe.

AN  - 1024664745; 16859448
AB  - The Rocky Mountain ridged mussel (Gonidea angulata) is a freshwater bivalve mollusc that reaches the northern extent of its global distribution in southern British Columbia. Gonidea angulata is restricted to the Okanagan Basin with small aggregations present in the northeast and southwest areas of Okanagan Lake in addition to a few individuals encountered in Vaseaux Lake and the Okanagan River. Recent broad-brush surveys indicate that their range and distribution is decreasing and their numbers are in decline. The preponderance of large adult mussels and the apparent absence of small and/or young juveniles could indicate a relict or ageing population with limited reproductive potential. Potential or known threats and their impacts to habitat such as channelization of the Okanagan River, dams and weirs, development of shoreline and littoral zones, pollutants, introduced species such as Eurasian watermilfoil and dreissenid mussels, are evaluated and mitigation measures are discussed. Recommendations for future research are provided in an attempt to fill knowledge gaps and to meet recovery objectives to sustain viable populations and prevent the extirpation of the Rocky Mountain ridged mussel in Canada.Original Abstract: La gonidee des Rocheuses (Gonidea angulata) est un mollusque bivalve d'eau douce. Le sud de la Colombie-Britannique correspond a la limite septentrionale de sa repartition mondiale. L'aire de repartition de la Gonidea angulata se limite au bassin de l'Okanagan; de petites concentrations sont presentes dans les zones nord-est et sud-ouest du lac Okanagan. En outre, on en retrouve quelques specimens dans le lac Vaseux et la riviere Okanagan. De recentes etudes globales indiquent que leur aire de repartition et leur distribution connaissent un retrecissement et que leur nombre est en declin. La preponderance des gonidees adultes de grande taille et l'absence apparente de petits et de jeunes gonidees pourraient etre le signe d'une population relique ou vieillissante dont le potentiel reproductif est limite. Les menaces potentielles ou connues pour l'habitat de cette espece, a savoir la canalisation de la riviere Okanagan, la construction de barrages et de deversoirs, l'amenagement des rives et des zones littorales, la presence de polluants et l'introduction d'especes comme le myriophylle en epi et les moules de la famille des dreissenides ainsi que des mesures d'attenuations sont a l'etude. On fournit des recommandations quant aux recherches a effectuer dans le but de combler les lacunes en matiere de connaissances et d'atteindre les objectifs de retablissement, c'est-a-dire le maintien des populations viables et la prevention de la disparition de la gonidee des Rocheuses au Canada.

T1  - Strategic Vision of the Great Lakes Fishery Commission 2011–2020
AN  - 1935794285
AB  - The Great Lakes Fishery Commission (commission) has published two strategic visions to explain and clarify its role in fishery management and research. The first vision, A Strategic Vision of the Great Lakes Fishery Commission for the Decade of the 1990s, consisted of a statement of purpose, a fundamental concept, and three vision statements, each with milestones and supporting rationales. This vision reflected the ecological challenges of the time and a desire to move forward on objectives commonly held by the commission and various government and non-government stakeholders. Non-native species began to appear in the Great Lakes in the 1800s. Completion of the Erie Canal in 1825 opened the way west for settlement, but also opened a more southerly connection from the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes. The alewife and the sea lamprey were among the first and most successful invaders to use this connection.

T1  - Effect of water velocity on growth and retention of cultured Greenshell(TM) mussel spat, Perna canaliculus (Gmelin, 1791)
AN  - 887939240
AB  - The Greenshell^sup TM^ mussel, Perna canaliculus, is a commercially important species forming New Zealand's largest aquaculture export product. Losses of P. canaliculus spat from culture ropes between larval settlement and the time mussels reach initial reseeding size (c. 10 mm) are common. To test whether water velocity affects growth and retention of post-settlement P. canaliculus spat, and whether there is a threshold effect of increasing velocities on spat migration, a laboratory-based experiment was conducted. Spat were grown for 8 weeks in experimental tanks on culture ropes at four velocities typical of velocities within mussel farms (40, 10, 4, and 1 cm s^sup -1^). Spat migration was observed at all the velocities tested, but the number of spat migrating decreased as water velocity increased. Spat retention was highest at the 40 cm s^sup -1^ velocity. Mean spat size increased significantly with increasing water velocity. At the highest velocity tested (40 cm s^sup -1^), migration increased as the spat grew suggesting that migration was density-driven. The results of this experiment indicate the potential for mussel farmers to reduce seeded spat loss and to increase the growth rate of spat by modification of the water flow within their farms, or placement of seeded ropes in locations of certain existing water velocities, and indicate that velocities in the range 15-40 cm s^sup -1^ promote higher spat growth and spat retention for P. canaliculus.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Spatial and temporal variabilities of [delta]^sup 13^C and [delta]^sup 15^N within lower trophic levels of a large lake: implications for estimating trophic relationships of consumers
AN  - 883909933
AB  - Stable isotopes of carbon (δ^sup 13^C) and nitrogen (δ^sup 15^N) often have unique values among lake habitats (e.g. benthic, littoral, pelagic), providing a widely used tool for measuring the structure and energy flow in aquatic food webs. However, there has been little recognition of the spatial and temporal variabilities of these isotopes within habitats of aquatic ecosystems. To address this, δ^sup 13^C and δ^sup 15^N were measured in seston, zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) and young-of-year (YOY) yellow (Perca flavescens), and white perch (Morone americana) collected from four sites across the offshore habitat of the western basin of Lake Erie during June-September 2009. Values of δ^sup 13^C and δ^sup 15^N showed significant spatial and temporal variations, with month accounting for >50% of the variation, for both stable isotopes and all the species except seston. Such variation in isotope values has the potential to significantly influence or confound interpretation of stable isotopes in measures, such as trophic position (TP) which use lower trophic level organisms as their baseline. For example, TP was found to vary up to 0.7 for yellow and white perch (TP = δ^sup 15^N^sub fish^ - δ^sup 15^N^sub zebra mussel^/diet-tissue fractionation factor) depending on the zebra mussel data used (e.g., from a different location or a different collection month). As the use of stable isotopes continues to move from qualitative to more quantitative measures of trophic structure, food web research must recognize the importance of stable isotopes' variability in lower trophic level organisms, especially in large lake systems.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Effects of desiccation on two life stages of an invasive snail and its native cohabitant
AN  - 883902400
AB  - Invasive species are of critical concern as they have the potential to rapidly alter biotic systems around the globe. The upper Mississippi River (UMR) system has been recently invaded by the aquatic snail, Bithynia tentaculata, which spread from the Great Lakes region. In addition to potentially impacting native aquatic snails, B. tentaculata also carries three parasites which kill thousands of migrating waterfowl annually. Although this invader is having detrimental impacts on a number of species in the UMR region, little is known regarding (1) the tolerances of B. tentaculata to abiotic stresses in this area, and (2) how stress thresholds in this species compare to native species across developmental stages. To help fill in these informational gaps, we conducted a series of laboratory experiments aimed at assessing the tolerances of B. tentaculata and a native snail (Physa gyrina) to desiccation at two stages of ontogeny (eggs and adults). Results showed that P. gyrina egg masses were more tolerant to a transient desiccation period (9 h) than B. tentaculata egg masses as evidenced by their higher hatching success. Conversely, adult survival in B. tentaculata was much greater than that of P. gyrina after a longer desiccation period (1 week). Although superior tolerance to drying varies between the developmental stages of each species, B. tentaculata may have an overall advantage due to its ability to endure prolonged drying at maturity. These results suggest that hydrologic fluctuations in the UMR may contribute to reductions in P. gyrina numbers, potentially facilitating B. tentaculata colonization and the spread of waterfowl infections.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Population Dynamics of Lake Ontario Lake Trout during 1985-2007
AN  - 1125238353; 17308316
AB  - Lake trout Salvelinus namaycush were extirpated from Lake Ontario circa 1950 owing to commercial and recreational fishing, predation by sea lampreys Petromyzon marinus, and habitat degradation. Since the 1970s, substantial efforts have been devoted to reestablishing a self-sustaining population through stocking, sea lamprey control, and harvest reduction. Although a stocking-supported population has been established, only limited natural reproduction has been detected. Since the 1990s, surveys have indicated a continuing decline in overall abundance despite fairly static stocking levels. We constructed a statistical catch-at-age model to describe the dynamics of Lake Ontario lake trout from 1985 to 2007 and explore what factor(s) could be causing the declines in abundance. Model estimates indicated that abundance had declined by approximately 76% since 1985. The factor that appeared most responsible for this was an increase in age-1 natural mortality rates from approximately 0.9 to 2.5 between 1985 and 2002. The largest source of mortality for age-2 and older fish was sea lamprey predation, followed by natural and recreational fishing mortality. Exploitation was low, harvest levels being uncertain and categorized by length rather than age. Accurate predictions of fishery harvest and survey catch per unit effort were obtained despite low harvest levels by using atypical data (e.g., numbers stocked as an absolute measure of recruitment) and a flexible modeling approach. Flexible approaches such as this might allow similar assessments for a wide range of lightly exploited stocks. The mechanisms responsible for declining age-1 lake trout survival are unknown, but the declines were coincident with an increase in the proportion of stocked fish that were of the Seneca strain and a decrease in the overall stocking rate. It is possible that earlier studies suggesting that Seneca strain lake trout would be successful in Lake Ontario are no longer applicable given the large ecosystem changes that have occurred subsequent to invasion by dreissenid mussels.

T1  - The effectiveness of the induced anti-predator behaviour of zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha in the presence of molluscivorous roach Rutilus rutilus
AN  - 878928676
AB  - We checked whether the induced anti-predator defences of zebra mussels are able to affect the predation success of roach, being one of the most efficient zebra mussel predators in Europe. Previously, several anti-predator defences of mussels have been observed in the presence of roach, including stronger attachment, aggregation forming and inhibition of upward movement. However, the actual efficiency of these responses to reduce the mussel vulnerability to predation was unknown. To check the effectiveness of attachment strength, we exposed mussels for 6 (strong attachment), 1 (weak attachment) or 0 (unattached) days in ceramic trays and then presented the trays to fish in an experimental tank. To test the effectiveness of aggregation, we glued mussels to the trays in groups of three (touching one another) or singly using denture glue and exposed them to fish. To check the effect of the vertical position, we glued mussels with denture glue to the bottom and 10, 20 and 30 cm above the bottom of the tank with fish. After 1-h exposure, we determined the percentages of consumed mussels. Roach predation rate was lowest on strongly attached mussels, intermediate on weakly attached mussels and highest on unattached mussels. Aggregated mussels were less frequently consumed than singletons. Conversely, the vertical position of mussels did not affect the roach predation success. Our study demonstrates that the behavioural defences exhibited by zebra mussels can increase their survival in the presence of predators and thus emphasizes the importance of the anti-predator behaviour of this species.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Polychaete invader enhances resource utilization in a species-poor system
AN  - 876785206; 21344257
AB  - Ecosystem consequences of biodiversity change are often studied from a species loss perspective, while the effects of invasive species on ecosystem functions are rarely quantified. In this experimental study, we used isotope tracers to measure the incorporation and burial of carbon and nitrogen from a simulated spring phytoplankton bloom by communities of one to four species of deposit-feeding macrofauna found in the species-poor Baltic Sea. The recently invading polychaete Marenzelleria arctia, which has spread throughout the Baltic Sea, grows more rapidly than the native species Monoporeia affinis, Pontoporeia femorata (both amphipods) and Macoma balthica (a bivalve), resulting in higher biomass increase (biomass production) in treatments including the polychaete. Marenzelleria incorporated and buried bloom material at rates similar to the native species. Multi-species treatments generally had higher isotope incorporation, indicative of utilization of bloom material, than expected from monoculture yields of the respective species. The mechanism behind this observed over-yielding was mainly niche complementarity in utilization of the bloom input, and was more evident in communities including the invader. In contrast, multi-species treatments had generally lower biomass increase than expected. This contrasting pattern suggests that there is little overlap in resource use of freshly deposited bloom material between Marenzelleria and the native species but it is likely that interference competition acts to dampen resulting community biomass. In conclusion, an invasive species can enhance incorporation and burial of organic matter from settled phytoplankton blooms, two processes fundamental for marine productivity.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Sympatric variability of isotopic baselines influences modeling of fish trophic patterns
AN  - 874026820
AB  - Stable isotope signatures of freshwater snails and mussels have been established as a convenient baseline measurement at the primary consumer level for food-web coupling studies. We measured δ^sup 15^N and δ^sup 13^C of primary consumers, including mussels (Anodonta woodiana, Cristaria plicata, and Unio douglasiae), snails (Bellamya aeruginosa and Hippeutis sp.), and zooplankton from the same habitat within a shallow eutrophic lake. Primary consumers showed positive relationship between δ^sup 15^N and δ^sup 13^C, indicating a linkage between planktonic and benthic habitats in this system. The variation in isotope ratios was higher in short-lived primary consumers (zooplankton) compared with the long-lived primary consumers (mussels and snails), suggesting limited availability of short-lived primary consumers as isotopic baselines in aquatic food-web assessment. Significant differences in isotope ratios were also found among three species of mussels, and when using these mussels separately as pelagic baselines to calculate trophic position and contribution of planktonic and benthic sources of fishes, bias and even misestimates were observed. This finding suggests that caution is needed when multiple primary consumers coexist in the same habitat, and it is important to assess potential effects of different baselines used.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Investigation of the genetic diversity of an invasive whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) in China using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA markers
AN  - 873570520; 21320364
AB  - Abstract

              
It is often considered that reduced genetic variation due to bottlenecks and founder effects limits the capacity for species to establish in new environments and subsequently spread. The recent invasion (during the past five years) of an alien whitefly, one member of Bemisia tabaci cryptic species complex, referred to as Mediterranean (herein referred to as Q-type) in Shandong Province, China, provides an ideal opportunity to study the changes in genetic variation between its home range in the Mediterranean region and its invasion range. Using both the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (mtCOI) and nuclear (microsatellite) DNA, we show that Q in Shandong likely originated in the western Mediterranean. We also found that the haplotype diversity was low compared with its presumed geographic origin, whereas microsatellite allele diversity showed no such decline. A key factor in invasions is the establishment of females and so bottleneck and founder events can lead to a very rapid and considerable loss of mitochondrial diversity. The lack of haplotype diversity in Shandong supports the interpretation that, at one or more points between the western Mediterranean and China, the invading Q lost haplotype diversity, most probably through the serial process of establishment and redistribution through trade in ornamental plants. However, the loss in haplotype diversity does not necessarily mean that nuclear allelic diversity should also decline. Provided females can mate freely with whichever males are available, allelic diversity can be maintained or even increased relative to the origin of the invader. Our findings may offer some explanation to the apparent paradox between the concept of reduced genetic variation limiting adaptation to new environments and the observed low diversity in successful invaders.

T1  - Occupation, body size and sex ratio of round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) in established and newly invaded areas of an Ontario river
AN  - 872238062
AB  - Invasive species represent a challenge because the particular characteristics of a species' invasion are often unknown before the invasion. To provide some clarity as to how invasive species demographic structure might change as a population advances its range, we compared the proportion of occupied sites, size structure and sex ratio of round gobies in the area where they first invaded with more recently invaded areas at the extent of their range in a river in south-eastern Ontario. We used a standardized angling technique to sample gobies larger than 45-mm total length in the summer and early autumn of 2007. Round goby at the upstream and downstream extent of their range occupied a lower proportion of randomly selected sites, and contained a wider distribution of sizes as well as significantly larger individuals. Sex ratios in all areas were male-biased and the male-to-female ratio was significantly higher in the upstream segment of the river (2.2:1) compared to the area of first introduction (1.4:1). The difference between the newly invaded and the established sites suggests that round goby population structure may be affected by density. The results of this study help us further describe the demographic characteristics of biological invasions whilst examples of population structure and behaviour in gobies and other species provide a basis for generating hypotheses for range expansion.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Survey and management of mussel Mytilus species in Scotland
AN  - 869904180
AB  - The important ecological role of Mytilus mussels in marine ecosystems, their high abundance in coastal waters and the demand for human consumption has made them a target species for aquaculture. Mussel cultivation is the most important and rapidly growing sector of the Scottish shellfish aquaculture industry and until recently production was considered to be based exclusively on the native species Mytilus edulis. However, the sympatric occurrence of M. edulis, M. trossulus, M. galloprovincialis and their hybrids in cultivation has recently been reported and significant production losses (over 50% at some sites) have been attributed to the presence of fragile-shelled M. trossulus. Given the ecological and economical importance of these species, an urgent need arose for a wider understanding of Mytilus species distribution on Scottish coasts and its implication for the sustainability of the Scottish shellfish industry. Here we present a summary of a 3-year project established within the "ECOsystem approach to SUstainable Management of the Marine Environment and its living Resources" (ECOSUMMER) Marie Curie network to address this need. We developed DNA-based molecular assays for the detection and surveillance of the different Mytilus species in Scotland. Several potential management strategies have been explored, aimed at favouring M. edulis production at mixed-species sites, but these have so far not been found to provide the reliable efficacy necessary for adoption by the industry. Complete eradication of M. trossulus from economically affected areas in Scotland may be unrealistic, especially considering that its introduction and distribution mechanisms in the environment remain uncertain. Area-specific solutions to managing the problem may thus be required, which may or may not involve eradication and fallowing (clearance of mussels from production sites for a given period of time). Nevertheless, the current distribution of M. trossulus is limited and its spread outside its existing range is clearly undesirable. Any management solutions must also be accompanied by an industry wide strategy and awareness, for example, through the development of an industry supported code of good practice.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Methods for sampling and analysis of marine microalgae in ship ballast tanks: a case study from Tampa Bay, Florida, USA
AN  - 928928084
AB  - Ballasting and deballasting of shipping vessels in foreign ports have been reported worldwide as a vector of introduction of non-native aquatic plants and animals. Recently, attention has turned to ballast water as a factor in the global increase of harmful algal blooms (HABs). Many species of microalgae, including harmful dinoflagellate species, can remain viable for months in dormant benthic stages (cysts) in ballast sediments. Over a period of four years, we surveyed ballast water and sediment of ships docked in two ports of Tampa Bay, Florida, USA. Sampling conditions encountered while sampling ballast water and sediments were vastly different between vessels. Since no single sample collection protocol could be applied, existing methods for sampling ballast were modified and new methods created to reduce time and labor necessary for the collection of high-quality, qualitative samples. Five methods were refined or developed, including one that allowed for a directed intake of water and sediments. From 63 samples, 1,633 dinoflagellate cysts and cyst-like cells were recovered. A native, cyst-forming, harmful dinoflagellate, Alexandrium balechii (Steidinger) F. J. R. Taylor, was collected, isolated, and cultured from the same vessel six months apart, indicating that ships exchanging ballast water in Tampa Bay have the potential to transport HAB species to other ports with similar ecologies, exposing them to non-native, potentially toxic blooms.

T1  - Suspended material availability and filtration-biodeposition processes performed by a native and invasive bivalve species in streams
AN  - 860203144
AB  - Unionid mussels are among the most threatened group of freshwater organisms globally. They are known for their ability to filter food particles from flowing and standing waters. However, invasive bivalve species, such as the Asian clam (Corbicula fluminea) in North America, have the potential to overlap in feeding and potentially out-compete the native species. Yet, the feeding preferences of unionid mussels and C. fluminea are incompletely understood. We hypothesized that Elliptio crassidens (native) and C. fluminea (invasive) would select for specific organic components present within seston. We examined changes in seston (dry mass and ash-free dry mass) resulting from bivalve feeding activity for three size classes of material that were isolated using gravimetric filtration. The treatments were also sub-sampled for flow cytometry (FC) which separated the suspended materials in the stream water into five categories: detritus, heterotrophic bacteria, picoautotrophs, nanoautotrophs, and heterotrophic nanoeukaryotes. Our results indicated that both species of bivalve showed preferences for organic and living materials. E. crassidens preferentially filtered nanoeukaryotes, whose decreases were associated with an increase in bacteria. In contrast, C. fluminea preferred smaller materials through selective filtration of picoautotrophs. In addition, both species increased the concentration of large materials toward the end of the experiment because of the suspension of their pseudofeces biodeposits. To our knowledge, this study is the first to examine grazing by bivalve species on natural stream particulate matter using FC. Our results suggest that native and non-native mussels have different functional roles, which has important implications for organic matter processing and food webs in streams.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Assessment of the Potential Cyto-Genotoxicity of the Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID) Diclofenac on the Zebra Mussel (Dreissena polymorpha)
AN  - 862018212
AB  - A battery of eight biomarkers was used on the freshwater bivalve Dreissena polymorpha in order to evaluate potential sub-lethal effects of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac (DCF; 2-[(2,6-dichlorophenyl)amino]phenylacetic acid). By an in vivo approach, mussels were exposed for 96 h to increasing concentrations (0.3, 1, and 2 nM) of DCF perfectly comparable with current surface water levels. We determined the single cell gel electrophoresis assay, the apoptotic frequency (DNA Diffusion assay), the micronucleus test (MN test), and the lysosomal membrane stability (Neutral Red Retention Assay) in mussel hemocytes. Moreover, the activity of catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and the phase II detoxifying enzyme glutathione S-transferase was measured in the cytosolic fraction extracted from a pool of entire bivalves to reveal possible alterations of the oxidative status of exposed specimens. The biomarker battery pointed out a negligible cyto- and genotoxicity on zebra mussel hemocytes since only a slight decrease of lysosomal membrane stability from baseline levels was measured at the end of exposures at the highest concentration (2 nM). In addition, environmental concentrations of DCF seem to have a negligible effect on the activities of antioxidant and detoxifying enzymes. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Use of Anguilla anguilla for Biomonitoring Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) in Brackish and Riverine Waters in Central and Southern Italy
AN  - 862018085
AB  - One of the aims of the Water Framework Directive 2000/60/CE is to assess the ecological status of water bodies in Europe in relation to priority contaminants, including some persistent organic pollutants (POP). Recognizing the benefits of measuring hydrophobic compounds in biota tissues rather than in water, we used the European eel Anguilla anguilla in the present study as a bioindicator species for monitoring POPs in freshwater/brackish environments. We present the results of a contamination analysis of eels carried out in three Italian sites representative of different pollution levels: the last part of Tevere River, which flows through a very urbanized and industrialized area, Caprolace Lake and Lesina Lagoon, inside two different protected national parks. A very high pollution variability was recorded within each group of eels, in particular for those caught at Caprolace Lake. Due to this high variability, inter-population comparisons were carried out only between eels collected in Tevere River and Lesina Lagoon. PCBs values in Lesina Lagoon were two orders of magnitude lower than those measured in Tevere River, while no significant differences were found for levels of DDT compounds. Our results confirm the suitability of the eel as an indicator of persistent bioaccumulative pollutants in brackish environments and rivers where it can be easily caught, but we are sceptical of its use in deep lakes where its capture might be problematic considering standard operation procedures for fish sampling.

T1  - Differences in Relative Predation Vulnerability Between Native and Non-native Oyster Larvae and the Influence on Restoration Planning in an Estuarine Ecosystem
AN  - 858918324
AB  - The costs and benefits of non-native introductions as a restoration tool should be estimated prior to any action to prevent both undesirable consequences and waste of restoration resources. The suggested introduction of non-native oyster species, Crassostrea ariakensis, into Chesapeake Bay, USA, provides a good example in which the survival of non-native oysters may differ from that of native oysters, Crassostrea virginica, during the larval stage. Experiments were conducted to compare the predation vulnerability of native and non-native oyster larvae to different predator types (visual vs. non-visual, benthic vs. pelagic). The results suggest that the non-native larvae are more vulnerable to visual and non-visual pelagic predators. Although vulnerability was similar for larvae exposed to benthic non-visual predators, the consumption of one non-native strain was higher than the consumption of native C. virginica larvae. When vulnerability data are combined with predator feeding rates, the predation mortality for non-native larvae in the wild can be much higher than for native larvae. Small changes in larval mortality rates can yield large changes in total larval delivery to the reef for settlement, so these differences among species may contribute to differences in settlement success. These results provide an example of how a comprehensive examination of the perceived benefits of non-native introductions into complex ecosystems can provide important information to inform management decisions.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Biofouling by bryozoans, Cordylophora and sponges in UK water treatment works
AN  - 1943588636
AB  - In recent years biofouling from native (bryozoans, sponges) and non-native (Cordylophora) animals has increased in UK water treatment works (WTW). A survey of six UK water companies and eight WTWs revealed that these taxa were more widespread and abundant than previously recognised. Primary problems related to the occlusion of underfloor nozzles and tailpipes in rapid gravity filter beds (RGFs). These cost the UK water industry £1.49 m between 2005 and 2009. Additional impacts came from skin irritation to operatives from sponge spicules and the potential for elevated bacterial pathogen levels. Sponges penetrated the furthest through the water treatment process, reaching the point of final chlorination at one WTW. A monitoring plate study showed pronounced seasonality in fouling, with most taxa peaking in mid to late summer before a winter die-off. Control options, including the use of chlorine, and the importance of resistant stages for each taxon are discussed.

T1  - The direct physical, chemical and biotic impacts on Australian coastal waters due to recreational boating
AN  - 857757599
AB  - In economically developed countries it is projected that by around 2015 over 50% of a person's lifetime will become available for leisure. Demand for leisure needs, already strong, will continue to increase. One segment of the market, outdoor nature-based recreation (including tourism), is growing strongly worldwide. A substantial proportion of these activities are water-based. The associated demand for recreational vessels has increased rapidly in recent years and is projected to continue to trend upwards. Australian trends mirror those internationally. Using Australia as a case study, we review the direct physical, chemical and biotic impacts associated with recreational boating in coastal water environments. Major physical impacts include disturbance due to movement of craft in shallow waters (e.g., turbulence) and the effects of anchoring/drag, noise/interference/collision that impacts on wildlife. The most critical chemical impacts result from pollution due to fuels and oils, defouling treatments (even those not legislated in-country), and human waste (e.g., sewage effluent). Important biotic impacts are the potential continued introduction and secondary spread of non-native species. We conclude that while greater research effort will provide more environmentally benign products, with the increasing popularity of recreation vessels, it will be beyond the resources of Australian governments to police legislation effectively. However, based on Australian's demonstrated engagement with government in terrestrial environmental management, with their deliberate engagement with the boating fraternity, the impacts of recreational boating would be lessened.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Resistance of the invasive pest mussel Limnoperna fortunei to anoxia: Implications for biofouling control
AN  - 861635995
AB  - As expected from previous studies on mollusk metabolic rates, oxygen consumption for L. fortunei is higher (and thus oxygen deprivation is more critical) at higher temperatures (Johnson & McMahon, 1998). Freshwater bivalve oxygen consumption rates are directly related to ambient water temperatures, with summer oxygen consumption rates being as much as more than 30 times the winter rates (Johnson & McMahon, 1998; Sprung, 1995a; [Burky, A.J.], 1983; Hornback et al, 1983).

T1  - Using long-term monitoring to investigate the changes in species composition in the harbour of Ghent (Belgium)
AN  - 852549559
AB  - The macroinvertebrate community of the harbour of Ghent was studied by analysing 135 samples taken at different sampling locations from 1990 until 2008. The results showed that the current Crustacea and Mollusca communities are mainly represented, in terms of abundances, by alien species. In total, seven alien and four indigenous crustacean species were found. Mollusc diversity was higher, with a total of 14 species, four of which were alien. Macroinvertebrate diversity was very low at the beginning of the 1990s, but increased due to the improvement of the chemical water quality achieved by sanitation and stricter environmental laws. This is reflected by the dissolved oxygen concentration, which increased from an average of 2 mg/l to an average of 9 mg/l, allowing more sensitive species to establish. Since 1993, the number of alien taxa has augmented, whereas the number of native taxa has remained stable. The improvement of the chemical water quality and the simultaneous increase in total number of species were also reflected in an increase of the Multimetric Macroinvertebrate Index Flanders, which is used to assess the ecological water quality in Flanders. Due to intensive international boat traffic and the low species diversity, the harbour of Ghent is highly vulnerable for invasions. Stronger regulations and a better understanding about the contribution of shipping, shortcuts via artificial water ways, habitat degradation and environmental pollution are required to reduce the further spread of alien species.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Population genetic structure of the round goby in Lake Michigan: implications for dispersal of invasive species
AN  - 852549543
AB  - Understanding subsequent dispersal of non-native species following introduction is important for predicting the extent and speed of range expansion and is critical for effective management and risk assessment. Post-introduction dispersal may occur naturally or via human transport, but assessing the relative contribution of each is difficult for many organisms. Here, we use data from seven microsatellite markers to study patterns of dispersal and gene flow among 12 pierhead populations of the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) in Lake Michigan. We find significant population structure among sampling sites within this single Great Lake: (1) numerous populations exhibited significant pairwise F ^sub ST^ and (2) a Bayesian assignment analysis revealed three distinct genetic clusters, corresponding to different pierhead locations, and genetic admixture between these clusters in the remaining populations. Genetic differentiation (F ^sub ST^) is generally related to geographic distance (i.e., isolation by distance), but is periodically interrupted at the scale of Lake Michigan due to gene flow among geographically distant sites. Moreover, average genetic differentiation among populations exhibit a significant, negative correlation with the amount of shipping cargo at ports. Our results, therefore, provide evidence that genetic structure of the round goby in Lake Michigan results from limited natural dispersal with frequent long-distance dispersal through anthropogenic activities such as commercial shipping. Our study suggests that while round gobies can undoubtedly disperse and found new populations through natural dispersal mechanisms, their spread within and among the Great Lakes is likely aided by transport via ships. We, therefore, recommend that ballast-water treatment and management may limit the spread of non-native species within the Great Lakes after the initial introduction in addition to preventing the introduction of non-native species to the Great Lakes.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Impacts of a Habitat-Forming Exotic Species on Estuarine Structure and Function: An Experimental Assessment of Eurasian Milfoil
AN  - 850433984
AB  - It is widely believed that successful colonization of ecosystems by non-native species will have catastrophic consequences for the recipient system. Within the Mobile-Tensaw Delta, AL, exotic Eurasian milfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum) has been reported to trigger degradation of ecosystem structure and function. We evaluated the impacts of structurally complex milfoil on food web structure and predator-prey interactions via comparisons with two native grasses, structurally simple wild celery (Vallisneria americana) and the more complex water stargrass (Heteranthera dubia). While significant differences were not detected in the faunal compositions of milfoil and stargrass habitats, significant differences between milfoil and wild celery were found. Laboratory experiments showed that rainwater killifish, a key contributor to these differences, preferred milfoil over wild celery, but did not occupy milfoil more than stargrass. Subsequent experiments indicated that survivorship was drastically lower in wild celery. Though many of the documented impacts of Eurasian milfoil have been cast as detrimental, shelter-seeking organisms may perceive milfoil in the same way as other complex native species.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The contribution of man-made ditches to the regional stream biodiversity of the new river watershed in the Florida panhandle
AN  - 816195619
AB  - Issue Title: Lake Restoration: An Experimental Ecosystem Approach for Eutrophication Control / Guest Editors: D.P. Hamilton, M.J. Landman // QuickBird Satellite Imagery as a Tool for Restoration and Rehabilitation of Lake Sevan, Armenia / Guest Editor: Martin A. Stapanian              The role of ditches as reservoirs for or contributors to regional diversity has rarely been assessed. In this study, we aimed (1) to assess the effect of ditches on aquatic faunal assemblages of first order streams and (2) to assess the extent to which the animal communities in altered streams that are crossed by ditches resembled those found in nearby natural streams. We examined the fauna of four different aquatic habitats of the New River watershed in the Florida Panhandle: (1) natural streams, (2) altered streams, (3) ditches that cross the altered streams, and (4) ditches that do not cross the altered streams, sampling these habitats in three geographically distinct sites and visiting each location three times during a summer. Ditches did not have the same environmental features as streams and as a result their faunal community did not completely mimic those of natural streams. Streams contained 50% less aquatic vegetation and more canopy cover, while natural streams were more acidic than any other habitat. The connected altered stream and ditch habitats contained the highest biodiversity, while natural streams contained the lowest. Our ordination of taxonomic composition did not reveal any significant differences between habitats. However, natural streams were more likely to contain Hyalella spp., Oligochaetes, and Palaemonetes spp. than other sites, yet did not contain Baetidae spp., Naucorida spp., Trepobate spp., Dolomedes                         okefinokensis, Leptolucania ommata, or any Centrarcids. These results indicate the importance of ditches within this system as a reservoir for and contributor to regional stream biodiversity and this finding should be taken into consideration by managers for the conservation of the regional freshwater biodiversity.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Differential toxicological effects induced by mercury in gills from three pedigrees of Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum by NMR-based metabolomics
AN  - 822712150; 21080220
AB  - Mercury is a hazardous pollutant in the Bohai marine environments due to its high toxicity to the marine organisms and subsequent ecological risk. Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum is one of important sentinel organisms in 'Mussel Watch Program' launched in China and therefore used as a bioindicator in marine and coastal ecotoxicology. There are dominantly distributed three pedigrees of clam (White, Liangdao Red and Zebra) in Yantai population endowed with different tolerances to environmental stressors. In this study, gill tissues were collected from both untreated and mercury exposed White, Liangdao Red and Zebra clams, and the extracts were analyzed by NMR-based metabolomics to compare the original metabolomes and the toxicological effects induced by mercury exposure in three pedigrees. The major abundant metabolites in White clam sample were branched-chain amino acids, lactate, alanine, arginine, acetoacetate, glutamate, succinate, citrate, malonate and taurine, while the metabolite profile of Liangdao Red clam sample comprises relative high levels of alanine, arginine, glutamate, succinate and glycogen. For Zebra clam sample, the metabolite profile exhibited relatively high amount of aspartate, acetylcholine and homarine. After 48 h exposure of 20 μg l^sup -1^ Hg^sup 2+^, the metabolic profiles from all the three pedigrees of clams commonly showed significant increases in alanine, arginine, glutamate, aspartate, α-ketoglutarate, glycine and ATP/ADP, and decreases in citrate, taurine and homarine. The unique metabolic differences between the metabolomes of gill tissues from Hg^sup 2+^-exposed White, Liangdao Red and Zebra clams were found, including elevated acetylcholine and branched-chain amino acids in White clams, and the declined succinate in both White and Liangdao Red samples as well as the declined betaine in Zebra and White clams. Overall, our findings showed the differential toxicological responses to mercury exposure and that White clams could be a preferable bioindicator for the metal pollution monitoring based on the metabolic changes from gill compared with other two (Liangdao Red and Zebra) pedigrees of clams.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AN  - 2059277197
AB  - The Rocky Mountain ridged mussel (RMRM, Gonidea angulata) is a freshwater bivalve mollusc that reaches the northern extent of its global distribution in southern British Columbia. In May 2010 the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) assessed this species as Endangered.  Current Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) practice is to undertake a recovery potential assessment when a species is assessed as Endangered or Threatened.  RMRM is presently restricted to the Okanagan Basin with small aggregations present in the northeast and southwest areas of Okanagan Lake, in addition to a few individuals encountered in Vaseaux Lake and the Okanagan River. Potential or known threats and their impacts to habitat such as channelization of the Okanagan River, dams and weirs, development of shoreline and littoral zones, pollutants, introduced species such as Eurasian watermilfoil and dreissenid mussels, are evaluated and mitigation measures were recommended. Recommendations for future research are provided in an attempt to fill knowledge gaps and to meet recovery objectives to sustain viable populations and prevent extirpation of the Rocky Mountain ridged mussel in Canada.     This Science Advisory Report has resulted from a Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat regional advisory meeting of February 25, 2011 on Recovery Potential Assessment (RPA) of Rocky Mountain Ridged Mussel (Gonidea Angulata) in British Columbia.  Additional publications from this process will be posted as they become available on the DFO Science Advisory Schedule at http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/csas-sccs/index-eng.htm.Alternate abstract:La gonidée des Rocheuses (Gonidea angulata) est un mollusque bivalve qui se trouve, dans le sud de la Colombie-Britannique, à l’extrémité nord de sa répartition mondiale. En mai 2010, le Comité sur la situation des espèces en péril au Canada (COSEPAC) a désigné la gonidée des Rocheuses en tant qu’espèce en voie de disparition. L’approche adoptée présentement par Pêches et Océans Canada (MPO) consiste à élaborer une évaluation du potentiel de rétablissement lorsqu’une espèce est désignée en voie de disparition ou menacée. La répartition de la gonidée des Rocheuses est, à l’heure actuelle, limitée au bassin de l’Okanagan; de petites concentrations sont présentes dans les zones du nord-est et du sud-ouest du lac Okanagan et quelques individus sont observés dans le lac Vaseux et dans la rivière Okanagan. Les menaces potentielles ou connues, à savoir la canalisation de la rivière Okanagan, la construction de barrages et de déversoirs, l’aménagement des rives et des zones littorales, la présence de polluants et l’introduction d’espèces comme le myriophylle en épi et les moules de la famille des dreissénidés, ainsi que leurs impacts sur l’habitat font l’objet d’une évaluation, et la prise de mesures d’atténuation est recommandée. On formule des recommandations quant aux études à effectuer dans le but de combler les lacunes dans les connaissances et d’atteindre les objectifs de rétablissement, c’est-à-dire maintenir des populations viables et éviter la disparition de la gonidée des Rocheuses au Canada.    Le présent avis scientifique fait suite à une réunion de consultation scientifique régionale du Secrétariat canadien de consultation scientifique de Pêches et Océans Canada qui a eu lieu le 25 février 2011 et qui portait sur l’évaluation du potentiel de rétablissement (EPR) de la gonidée des Rocheuses (Gonidea Angulata) en Colombie-Britannique. D’autres documents découlant de ce processus seront publiés, dès qu’ils seront disponibles, dans le calendrier des avis scientifiques du MPO à : http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/csas-sccs/index-fra.htm

T1  - Spatial Ecology and Population Genetics of Northern Map Turtles (Graptemys geographica) in Fragmented and Continuous Habitats in Canada
AN  - 840753198
AB  - In riverine systems, the construction of locks and dams may present barriers to movement for aquatic organisms and effectively fragment otherwise continuous populations. We examined the spatial ecology and population genetics of northern map turtles (Graptemys geographica) in the Trent-Severn Waterway (TSW), Ontario, Canada. We hypothesized that the locks and dams on the TSW are fragmenting map turtle habitats and creating barriers to movement, and predicted that turtles from fragmented habitats have significantly reduced home range sizes and daily movements compared to turtles from unfragmented habitats, and that populations on either side of a lock and dam would be genetically distinct. Home ranges and average daily movements were smaller for turtles from fragmented habitats compared with continuous habitats, indicating that locks and dams are restricting mobility. However, populations in fragmented habitats showed none of the predicted genetic consequences of fragmentation (e.g., reduced heterozygosity and allelic richness, differentiation across a barrier). Genetic data may be reflecting historic population structure because only a few turtle generations have passed since the construction of the locks and dams about 100 years ago. Additionally, our genetic data may not be sufficiently robust to detect differentiation at this relatively small geographic scale. Our study highlights the conservation importance of examining multiple facets of a single potential threat, especially for long-lived species that may show differences in short- and long-term effects of fragmentation.

AB  - We investigated the predation and depth effects on abundance and size distribution of an invasive freshwater bivalve, Limnoperna fortunei, post-larvae using screened (5-, 25-, and 50-mm mesh openings) and unscreened cages at three depths (6, 12, and 1 m above the bottom) in a dam reservoir, Lake Ohshio of Japan. The densities of L. fortunei on the unscreened cages were much lower than those of the 5-mm mesh screened cages at any depth. The predation rates estimated by dividing the density of the unscreened cage by that of the 5-mm mesh screened cage were 97.3% at 6 m depth, 96.6% at 12 m depth, and 95.8% at the bottom. Shell lengths of L. fortunei post-larvae were small on bottom cages, and their size distribution was significantly different from those at other depths. These results suggest that predation and depth affected the abundance and size distribution of L. fortunei in the lentic environment. The impact of L. fortunei invasion on the food web and the possibility of regulating their population by predation pressures are also discussed.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Preferences of juveniles and adults of the invasive Ponto-Caspian amphipod Pontogammarus robustoides for various species of macrophytes and artificial substrata
AN  - 755546450
AB  - We studied preferences of invasive Ponto-Caspian amphipod P. robustoides for various macrophyte species (Myriophyllum spicatum, Ceratophyllum demersum, Potamogeton perfoliatus, Elodea canadensis) and artificial plant-like objects (artificial Christmas tree branches) in laboratory pairwise-choice tests. Juvenile (<7 mm) and adult gammarids exhibited different habitat preferences. Adults did not discriminate between artificial and natural substrata, or among most of the tested species of plants. In contrast, juveniles clearly preferred all tested macrophytes over artificial substrata. Moreover, they particularly preferred plants with the finest leaf elements: M. spicatum and C. demersum over the others and E. canadensis over P. perfoliatus. We found no influence of chironomid larvae, a potential food source for adult gammarids, on their distribution, nor any effect of adults on the habitat choice by juveniles. The habitat partitioning between juvenile and adult P. robustoides may help them survive in a new environment and increase their invasive potential by reducing the intraspecific competition and cannibalism.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Native Dreissena freshwater mussels in the Balkans: in and out of ancient lakes
AN  - 817609823; 13970855
AB  - The Balkans is a biogeographically highly diverse region and a worldwide hotspot of endemic freshwater diversity. A substantial part of this diversity is attributed to well recognized and potential ancient lakes in its southwestern part. However, despite considerable research efforts, faunal relationships among those lakes are not well understood. Therefore, genetic information from native representatives of the mussel genus Dreissena is here used to test the biogeographical zonation of the southwestern Balkans, to relate demographic changes to environmental changes, to assess the degree of eco-insularity, to reconstruct their evolutionary history, and to explore the potential of native taxa for becoming invasive. Phylogeographical and population genetic analyses indicate that most studied populations belong to two native species: D. presbensis (including the distinct genetic subgroup from Lake Ohrid, "D. stankovici") and D. blanci. In addition, the first confirmed record of invasive D. polymorpha in the southwestern Balkan is presented. The distribution of native Dreissena spp. generally coincides with the biogeographical zonations previously suggested based on fish data. However, there is disagreement on the assignment of the ancient lakes in the area to respective biogeographical regions. The data for Lake Ohrid are not conclusive. A closer biogeographical connection to lakes of the Vardar region and possibly the northern Ionian region is, however, suggested for Lake Prespa. The reconstruction of the evolutionary history of Dreissena spp. suggests that populations underwent demographic and spatial expansions in the recent past. Expansions started around 320 000-300 000 years ago in "D. stankovici", 160 000-140 000 years ago in D. blanci, and 110 000-70 000 years ago in D. presbensis. These time frames are discussed within the context of available paleogeological data for lakes Ohrid and Prespa. It is suggested that regional environmental changes may have had pronounced effects on the population histories of native Dreissena spp., though the high buffer capacity of Lake Ohrid may have lessened these effects in "D. stankovici". In addition, local events influencing individual lakes had very likely considerable effects on the demographic histories of Dreissena spp. as well. The observed patterns of immigration and emigration in and out of ancient lakes may suggest that limited gene flow enabled the survival of few isolated subpopulations and that later on eco-insularity (selective advantages of locally adopted groups) may have prevented excessive hybridization and sympatry of closely related taxa. As for the potential invasiveness of native Dreissena spp., the inferred spatial expansions are not human-mediated and all taxa still appear to be restricted to their native ranges. A concern, however, is that today D. presbensis and D. blanci also occur in artificial water bodies, and that invasive D. polymorpha has reached the area.

T1  - Impacts of invasion by Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas, 1771) on the performance of macroinvertebrate assessment tools for eutrophication pressure in lakes
AN  - 851775939
AB  - Aquatic ecosystems are experiencing increasing disturbance from multiple stressors caused by anthropogenic activities. The potential for multiple stressors to modify each others' impacts is not well understood. Legislation such as the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) requires the development of tools to assess human impacts in aquatic systems that incorporate ecological elements, such as macroinvertebrates. Nutrient enrichment and invasive species are major threats to freshwater systems. The invasive zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha is a conspicuous invader in freshwater aquatic systems in Europe and North America, and has been linked to drastic changes in macroinvertebrate communities and lake ecology. In 31 lake sites varying in nutrient pressure and in the presence or absence of D. polymorpha we tested three ecological quality assessment tools based on macroinvertebrate assemblages (% Sensitive Taxa to Total Phosphorus (TP), TP Score and Indicator Taxa Metric) and two basic ecological metrics. There were highly significant changes in macroinvertebrate diversity, structure, and composition associated with the invasion by D. polymorpha. While the three metrics performed consistently well in non-invaded systems, they lost explanatory power for eutrophication pressure in invaded systems. Our results suggest that metrics may need to be developed separately for invaded and non-invaded systems, and that the interaction between alien species and nutrient enrichment requires further investigation.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Diet composition and consumption rate in round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) in its expansion phase in the Trent River, Ontario
AN  - 751418434
AB  - We assessed density, gut fullness and prey composition of round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) from three areas in the Trent River (Ontario) representing areas of initial introduction and subsequent expansion. Round goby had been present at the area of original introduction since 2003, and by 2007/2008, their range had expanded upstream and downstream into the outermost reaches sampled in the study. Catch per unit angling effort in nearshore sites indicated that round goby density in the area of original introduction was more than double their density in the upstream expansion area and nearly three times the density in the downstream expansion area. Gut fullness index was lower in gobies from the area of original introduction than for those at the upstream and downstream edges of their expanded range. The most dramatic difference in diet composition was with dreissenids, where large gobies ([greater than or equal to] 70 mm) occupying the area of original introduction had almost no dreissenid biomass in their guts, whereas dreissenids were the predominant prey type in gobies occupying the two expansion areas. Post-hoc zebra mussel density in the area of original introduction was an order of magnitude lower than in the two expansion areas which, combined with the differences in stomach fullness and prey composition, suggest that local, density-related reduction of this prey type was occurring in the river.

T1  - Phosphorus-mediated changes in life history traits of the invasive New Zealand mudsnail (Potamopyrgus antipodarum)
AN  - 501348242; 20033217
AB  - Understanding the mechanisms that species use to succeed in new environments is vital to predicting the extent of invasive species impacts. Food quality is potentially important because it can affect population dynamics by affecting life history traits. The New Zealand mudsnail, Potamopyrgus antipodarum, is a worldwide invader. We examined how mudsnail growth rate and fecundity responded to the C:P ratio of algal food in laboratory conditions. Mudsnails fed low-P algae (C:P 1,119) grew more slowly, matured later, produced smaller offspring, and grew to a smaller adult size than snails reared on algae with high levels of P. A relatively small increase in algal C:P (203-270) significantly increased mudsnail age at maturity. We suggest that the relatively high body P requirements of mudsnails make them susceptible to allocation trade-offs between growth and reproduction under P-limited conditions. The elemental composition of algae varies greatly in nature, and over half of the rock biofilms in streams surveyed within the introduced range of mudsnails in the Greater Yellowstone Area had C:P ratios above which could potentially pose P limitation of life history traits. High growth rate and fecundity are common traits of many species that become invasive and are also associated with high-P demands. Therefore, fast-growing consumers with high P demands, such as mudsnails, are potentially more sensitive to P limitation suggesting that limitation of growth and reproduction by food quality is an important factor in understanding the resource demands of invasive species.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The Case of Pollution of Lake Maggiore: a 12-Year Study with the Bioindicator Mussel Dreissena polymorpha
AN  - 375397528
AB  - In 1996, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) pollution of industrial origin was discovered in Lake Maggiore. It was caused by industrial effluents on a tributary of the River Toce, one of the major affluents of the lake in correspondence of Pallanza Bay. This event is the worst case of environmental pollution that has occurred in Western countries in the last 25 years, not due to agricultural use of DDT, but because of an accidental industrial discharge. Heavy polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) pollution was also noticed in 2002, with concentration levels three to seven times higher than those measured in other Italian subalpine lakes. In this study, the current DDT and PCBs contamination levels were assessed according to their presence in zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) specimens sampled in the last 5 years (2003-2008) in eight sampling stations of Lake Maggiore, chosen to cover the entire perimeter of the basin. Moreover, for two stations (Baveno and Pallanza-Villa Taranto) located inside and outside Pallanza Bay, respectively, it is possible to make comparisons starting from 1996. The results obtained show how Lake Maggiore is still an ecosystem with a severe environmental risk, more than 10 years after the original insecticide discharge. DDT contamination continues to evolve, and natural events, like lake overturn, floods, and heavy rains, can have a great influence on the insecticide levels in the lake. By contrast, PCB contamination is absolutely negligible, even if the peak of pollution revealed in 2002 seems to indicate that these pollutants are still present in large quantities in the Lake Maggiore watershed.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Native Dreissena freshwater mussels in the Balkans: in and out of ancient lakes
AN  - 745937635; 13187300
AB  - The Balkans is a biogeographically highly diverse region and a worldwide hotspot of endemic freshwater diversity. A substantial part of this diversity is attributed to well recognized and potential ancient lakes in its southwestern part. Despite considerable research efforts, faunal relationships among those lakes are, however, not well understood. Therefore, genetic information from native representatives of the mussel genus Dreissena is used here to test the biogeographical zonation of the Southwestern Balkans, to relate demographic changes to environmental changes, to assess the degree of eco-insularity, to reconstruct their evolutionary history, and to explore the potential of native taxa for becoming invasive. Phylogeographical and population genetic analyses indicate that most populations studied belong to two native species: D. presbensis (incl. the distinct genetic subgroup from Lake Ohrid, D. ''stankovici'') and D. blanci. In addition, the first confirmed record of invasive D. polymorpha in the Southwestern Balkan is presented. The distribution of native Dreissena spp. is largely in concordance with the biogeographical zonations previously proposed based on fish data. Disagreement, however, consists regarding the assignment of the ancient lakes in the area to biogeographical regions. The data for Lake Ohrid are not conclusive. For Lake Prespa, however, a closer biogeographical connection to lakes of the Vardar region and possibly the Northern Ionian region is suggested. While reconstructing the evolutionary histories of Dreissena spp., signs of major demographic and spatial expansions were found. They started some 320 000-300 000 years ago in D. ''stankovici'', some 160 000-140 000 years ago in D. blanci, and some 110 000-70 000 years ago in D. presbensis. These time frames are discussed within the context of available paleogeological data for lakes Ohrid and Prespa. It is suggested that regional environmental changes may have had pronounced effects on the population histories of native Dreissena spp., though the high buffer capacity of Lake Ohrid may have mitigated these effects in D. ''stankovici''. In addition, local events acting upon individual lakes very likely had considerable effects on the demographic histories of Dreissena spp. as well. The observed patterns of immigration and emigration in and out of ancient lakes may suggest that limited gene flow supported the survival of small isolated subpopulations, while eco-insularity may have prevented excessive hybridization and sympatry of closely related taxa. As for the potential invasiveness of native Dreissena spp., the significant spatial expansions inferred are not human-mediated and all taxa still appear to be restricted to their native ranges. Of concern, however, is that D. presbensis and D. blanci today also occur in artificial water bodies, and that invasive D. polymorpha has reached the area.

T1  - Feeding in Syntopy: Diet of Hydromedusa tectifera and Phrynops hilarii (Chelidae)
AN  - 612783702
AB  - Stomach contents were obtained from 25 Hydromedusa tectifera and 47 Phrynops hilarii that live in syntopy in a pampasic stream in Buenos Aires province, Argentina. Both species are arthropod consumers. Copepods, ostracods, and hemipterans are the preferred items for P. hilarii, and H. tectifera prefers copepods, ostracods, immature dipterans (mainly chironomids), and ephemeropteran larvae. Items that most contribute to the diet of both species are immature chironomids, corixids, and belostomatids. Available food varies little among seasons, being slightly lower in winter months and part of the summer. Diet diversity changes by seasonal variation of prey item abundance in the diet of both species. Diet diversity is higher for P. hilarii (more generalist and broader trophic niche) than in H. tectifera, but there is no niche overlap between them. No significant correlation between the size of turtles and length of prey items was found. There is no evidence that the long neck of H. tectifera relates to piscivorous habits, because fish are a small fraction of its diet and arthropods constitute the bulk of the ingested items.

T1  - Correlates of vulnerability among arthropod species threatened by invasive ants
AN  - 356637364
AB  - Invasive species are causing population declines and extinctions of native species worldwide. Correlates of species vulnerability, which help identify at-risk taxa, are not well developed for arthropods, particularly with respect to threats from invasive species. At five sites undergoing invasion by ants in the Hawaiian Islands, we assessed body size, population density, trophic role and provenance (introduced or endemic to the Hawaiian Islands) as potential correlates of vulnerability for 300 arthropod species. Among rare species, provenance was the most important factor associated with absence from invaded plots, with endemic species much more commonly absent. Trophic role was also important, but only when interacting with provenance: endemic carnivores were by far the most vulnerable group, followed by endemic detritivores. For non-rare species, Hawaii endemics were significantly more reduced in invaded plots compared to introduced species. In addition, species that occurred at lower population densities were more vulnerable than those occurring at higher densities. Body size did not correlate with vulnerability for either rare or non-rare species. Despite these trends, there was relatively high variability in responses to invasion among species in many taxonomic orders, as well as among populations of particular species at different sites. While the consideration of additional intrinsic traits might increase predictive ability to some degree (e.g., intrinsic traits only explained 21% of the variation in impact among non-rare species), community-specific extrinsic factors appear to play a large role in influencing outcomes for many species, making prediction substantially more difficult.

T1  - Recent ecological trends in lower trophic levels of the international section of the St. Lawrence River: a comparison of the 1970s to the 2000s
AN  - 304764410
AB  - Changes from the 1970s to 2000s in phosphorus and chlorophyll levels, water transparency, zooplankton, and benthic communities in the upper, International Section of the St. Lawrence River were evaluated using trend data from limnological surveys. The influence of Lake Ontario as a source for riverine production was evident in the upper river. Total phosphorus levels from 1976 to 1978 (average ~20 mcg/l) sampled during a period of nutrient pollution declined (to 6-7 mcg/l) following abatement. As expected, water transparency indicated by summer Secchi depths showed an opposite response increasing from ~3.5 m in the 1970s to >10 m by 2003 but declined to 6-7 m in more recent years. Zooplankton communities have experienced declines in overall densities, and the community has changed but its primary components, Bosmina and Diacyclops remain. Ceriodaphnia lacustris abundance declined substantially from the 1970s to the recent time period while Chydorus sphaericus increased and Eurytemora affinis and Cercopagis pengoi had first appearances. In contrast, benthic invertebrate biomass increased substantially between time periods. Increases in families and occurrence of gastropods were observed, but the primary components--chironomids, amphipods, and oligochaetes--were consistent between the periods with the exception of dreissenid mussels. Dreissena was dominated by D. bugensis, and both D. bugensis and D. polymorpha show evidence of recent declines. Conversely, high abundance of round goby (Apollonia melanostomus) has promoted new trophic pathways. Downstream attenuation in nutrients and chlorophyll, and increased transparency suggest continued strong effects of Lake Ontario on the downstream river environment, but increased energy in the benthos has likely promoted greater in situ production.

T1  - Changes in attachment strength and aggregation of zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha in the presence of potential fish predators of various species and size
AN  - 195896146
AB  - We studied the attachment strength and aggregation behaviour of Dreissena polymorpha in the presence of large roach Rutilus rutilus (>180 mm total length) (efficient molluscivore), small roach (<110 mm) (unable to feed on zebra mussels) and perch Perca fluviatilis (not feeding on mussels). The intention was to check whether small (<10 mm) and large (>10 mm) mussels would respond specifically to fish capable of consuming them (i.e. large roach). After 1 day of exposure, we found no significant differences in mussel attachment strength. After 6 days in the presence of large roach, mussels were attached more strongly than in the other treatments. After a 1-day exposure to all kinds of fish, mussels were more aggregated than in the control treatment. After 6 days, the largest percentage of aggregated mussels was found in the presence of large roach, while the aggregation levels in the other treatments were lower and did not differ from one another. Perhaps, an initial response was a non-specific reaction to the presence of any fish, while a specific response to large roach appeared later. Thus, zebra mussels were able to recognize their potential predators. The observed behaviour of mussels may enhance their resistance to molluscivores in the field by limiting the access of predators to their potential prey (due to the increased aggregation of prey) and by increasing predator handling costs (due to the stronger attachment of prey).

T1  - Heavy metal concentrations in the soft tissues of swan mussel (Anodonta cygnea) and surficial sediments from Anzali wetland, Iran
AN  - 222006187; 19266295
AB  - Concentrations of cadmium, copper, and lead were determined in surficial sediments and the soft tissues (foot and gills) of swan mussel Anodonta cygnea from two sampling sites in Anzali wetland, which is an internationally important wetland registered in the Ramsar Convention. The metal contents in the mussel species from the studied region were comparable to other world areas. In most cases, the levels of the metals either fell within the range for other areas or were lower. There were significant differences between the tissues for the accumulation of Cd and Pb. Only in the case of Pb accumulation in gills significant differences between the specimens from the selected sampling sites could be observed. Age-related correlations were found in the case of Cu accumulation in foot and Cd levels in gills. No weight-dependent trend could be observed for the accumulation of the three elements. There was significant negative width-dependent relationship in the case of Cu. A significant negative correlation was also found between the maximum shell height and Cu accumulation in the gills. The only association among the elements in the selected soft tissues was found between Cd and Pb. Highly significant differences could be found between the sampling sites from the concentration of the elements in sediments point of view. The pattern of metal occurrence in the selected tissues and sediments exhibited the following descending order: Pb, Cu>Cd for gills, Cu>Pb, Cd for foot, and Cu>Pb>Cd for sediments. The mean concentrations of Cd and Pb in the sediments from the study area were higher than the global baseline values and world average shale. In the case of Cu, our results were somewhat higher than the baseline values but well below the world average shale.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Ecology of freshwater shore zones
AN  - 199873459
AB  - Freshwater shore zones are among the most ecologically valuable parts of the planet, but have been heavily damaged by human activities. Because the management and rehabilitation of freshwater shore zones could be improved by better use of ecological knowledge, we summarize here what is known about their ecological functioning. Shore zones are complexes of habitats that support high biodiversity, which is enhanced by high physical complexity and connectivity. Shore zones dissipate large amounts of physical energy, can receive and process extraordinarily high inputs of autochthonous and allochthonous organic matter, and are sites of intensive nutrient cycling. Interactions between organic matter inputs (including wood), physical energy, and the biota are especially important. In general, the ecological character of shore zone ecosystems is set by inputs of physical energy, geologic (or anthropogenic) structure, the hydrologic regime, nutrient inputs, the biota, and climate. Humans have affected freshwater shore zones by laterally compressing and stabilizing the shore zone, changing hydrologic regimes, shortening and simplifying shorelines, hardening shorelines, tidying shore zones, increasing inputs of physical energy that impinge on shore zones, pollution, recreational activities, resource extraction, introducing alien species, changing climate, and intensive development in the shore zone. Systems to guide management and restoration by quantifying ecological services provided by shore zones and balancing multiple (and sometimes conflicting) values are relatively recent and imperfect. We close by identifying leading challenges for shore zone ecology and management.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Food webs and the Upper Mississippi River: contributions to our understanding of ecosystem function in large rivers
AN  - 195903386
AB  - Issue Title: Upper Mississippi River Research Synthesis:  Forty Years of Ecological Research / Guest Editors: S.P. Romano & B. Ickes

              
Studies on the Upper Mississippi River, particularly over the last 15 years, have contributed to our understanding of trophic processes in large rivers. The framework established by earlier population-specific studies, however, cannot be overlooked. Examination of the feeding habits of fish ranging from planktivores to piscivores gave the first indication that trophic processes were influenced by the spatial complexity and annual hydrological patterns of river-floodplain ecosystems. Experimental studies, which have often been considered impossible or impractical in large rivers, demonstrated the potential for biotic controls of system dynamics through predator-prey and competitive interactions. Such studies have been particularly helpful in understanding the potential impact of non-native species, including zebra mussels and Asian carp, to biodiversity and secondary production. Our understanding of riverine ecosystem function expanded greatly as food web studies began the application of a new tool--natural stable isotopes. Studies employing stable isotopes illustrated how food webs in a number of large rivers throughout the world are supported by the autochthonous production of microalgae. This study, coupled with other studies testing the prevailing models of riverine ecosystem function, has brought us to a point of better understanding the nature of river ecosystem functions. It is through looking back at the earlier studies of fish diet that we should realize that the temporal and spatial complexities of river ecosystem function must still be addressed more fully. This and a better grasp of the significance of the arrangement of patches within the riverine landscape will prove beneficial, as we assess the appropriate scale of river rehabilitation with an eye on how rehabilitation promotes productivity within complex ecosystems, including the Upper Mississippi River.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Forty years of science and management on the Upper Mississippi River: an analysis of the past and a view of the future
AN  - 195896919
AB  - Issue Title: Upper Mississippi River Research Synthesis:  Forty Years of Ecological Research / Guest Editors: S.P. Romano & B. Ickes              The articles in this volume of Hydrobiologia commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Mississippi River Research Consortium by synthesizing research and monitoring conducted on the river over the past 40 years. This article briefly describes the recent history of development (since 1866) of the river and the programs that currently support monitoring, research, and rehabilitation of the river. These programs have generated much of the information reported in the articles, which cover hydrology and geomorphology, contaminants, nutrients, plants, reptiles and amphibians, food webs, and concepts of river ecology. The Upper Mississippi River is still responding to changes that occurred 70 or more years ago (construction of navigation dams, leveeing of the floodplains, and intensification of agriculture in the catchment) and to new stressors (climate change, invasive species, hormone-disrupting chemicals). Nevertheless, the river continues to attract 12 million visitors per year along the scenic Great River Road, hosts 36% of all the migrating ducks in the contiguous United States, and is home to 129 native species of freshwater fishes. The biological productivity and diversity of the river are likely to be maintained and even enhanced if the following occur: (1) planned rehabilitation efforts are coupled with hypothesis testing (adaptive environmental assessment and management); (2) sampling is extended beyond the six river reaches that are currently monitored intensively; (3) new sensor networks are developed and deployed; (4) water quality is protected by better controls on nonpoint sources and better testing of new chemicals before they are widely introduced; and (5) ways are found to engage multidisciplinary teams of academic scientists around the world, as well as agency scientists and managers, in cooperative efforts to better understand and manage large, complex, dynamic floodplain-river ecosystems.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Significant ecosystem-wide effects of the swiftly spreading invasive freshwater bivalve Limnoperna fortunei
AN  - 860387318; 14393347
AB  - Since its introduction in South America around 1990, the freshwater Asian mussel Limnopernafortunei has been shown to strongly interact with several components of the local biota. However, investigation of its ecosystem-wide effects was hindered by (1) difficulties associated with evaluation of its densities over large spatial scales and (2) scarcity of pre-invasion environmental data. The present survey overcomes these shortcomings and addresses the question whether Limnoperna's impact on the ecosystem-wide scale is measurable and significant. On the basis of diver-collected bottom samples, we estimated the overall density of this mussel in a reservoir (Embalse de Rio Tercero, Argentina), where Limnoperna is present since 1998 and analyzed changes in several water-column properties before and after the invasion. The 47km super(2) reservoir hosts around 45billion mussels; at these densities, a volume equivalent to that of this water body can potentially be filtered by the bivalves every 2-3days. Data collected regularly since 1996 indicate that after the invasion water transparency increased, and suspended matter, chlorophyll a, and primary production decreased significantly, with strong changes occurring in the area with highest mussel densities. Our results indicate that the ecosystem-wide impacts of Limnoperna are generally comparable to those described in Europe and North America for another invasive mussel--Dreissena polymorpha. However, given Limnoperna's wider tolerance limits, its influence on newly invaded water bodies, potentially including Europe and North America, will probably be stronger.

T1  - Home-field advantage: native signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) out consume newly introduced crayfishes for invasive Chinese mystery snail (Bellamya chinensis)
AN  - 217972589
AB  - The introduction of non-indigenous plants, animals and pathogens is one of today's most pressing environmental challenges. Freshwater ecologists are challenged to predict the potential consequences of species invasions because many ecosystems increasingly support novel assemblages of native and non-native species that are likely to interact in complex ways. In this study we evaluated how native signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) and non-native red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) and northern crayfish (Orconectes virilis) utilize a novel prey resource: the non-native Chinese mystery snail (Bellamya chinensis). All species are widespread in the United States, as well as globally, and recent surveys have discovered them co-occurring in lakes of Washington State. A series of mesocosm experiments revealed that crayfish are able to consume B. chinensis, despite the snail's large size, thick outer shell and trapdoor defense behaviour. Crayfish exhibited size-selective predation whereby consumption levels decreased with increasing snail size; a common pattern among decapod predators. Comparison of prey profitability curves--defined as the yield of food (weight of snail tissue) per second of feeding time (the time taken to crack the shell and consume the contents)--suggests that small and very large snails may represent the most profitable prey choice. By contrast, previous studies have reported the opposite pattern for crayfish consumption on thin-shelled snails. For all snail size classes, we found that native P. leniusculus and invasive O. virilis consumed greater numbers of snails than invasive P. clarkii. Moreover, P. leniusculus consistently handled and consumed snails at a faster pace compared to both invasive crayfishes across the range of snail sizes examined in our study. These results suggest not only that B. chinensis is a suitable food source for crayfish, but also that native P. leniusculus may ultimately out-consume invasive crayfishes for this new prey resource.

T1  - Influence of substrate preference and complexity on co-existence of two non-native gammarideans (Crustacea: Amphipoda)
AN  - 217972499
AB  - Substrate choice, swimming activity and risk to predation by burbot (Lota lota) of the well established Gammarus roeselii and the invader Dikerogammarus villosus were studied in mixed and single-species aquarium experiments. We used stones, gravel and aquatic weeds (Elodea, Chara) as substrates. We hypothesized that both species have different substrate preferences and that substrate affects the predation risk. We also assumed that presence of D. villosus influences substrate preference and predation risk of G. roeselii since the invader is known to affect the behavior of other gammarids. Adults of D. villosus in single species experiments and juveniles in mixed and single species experiments were evenly distributed over the different substrates but adults in mixed species experiments were more likely to prefer stone substrate. In contrast, adults and juveniles of G. roeselii clearly preferred aquatic weeds independent of the presence/absence of the invader. Both species preferred substrates with fissured surface over substrates with smooth surface. Gammarus roeselii was observed swimming more often than D. villosus in the open water but its swimming activity was lower when its preferred substrate was present compared with its swimming activity if non-preferred substrates were present. Predation rate of burbot on D. villosus was comparatively low and independent of the substrate. Burbot consumed many more G. roeselii than D. villosus, both in mixed and single species experiments. But when the preferred substrate of G. roeselii (weeds) was used in the experiments, predation rate of burbot on G. roeselii was somewhat lower than that when non-preferred substrates were present. The results of the experiments support our hypothesis that the gammarids studied here have different substrate preferences and that presence of the preferred substrate can affect predation risk. However, there is no evidence that presence of D. villosus affected substrate choice or predation risk in G. roeselii. We consider that differences in use of spatial niches permit co-existence of G. roeselii and D. villosus in the wild when substrates are diverse. The fact that G. roeselii than D. villosus is more often observed swimming in the open water may explain its higher risk of being captured by fish. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Effects of conspecifics on settling juveniles of the invasive golden mussel, Limnoperna fortunei
AN  - 199926305
AB  - We conducted a field experiment to assess the influence of conspecific adults on recruitment success of the golden mussel Limnoperna fortunei. Tiles, 225 cm^sup 2^ surface area, were used as artificial substrates in four treatments: control (blank tiles), low (800 mussels m^sup -2^), medium (4,000 mussels m^sup -2^) and high (12,000 mussels m^sup -2^) density treatments. Results indicated that recruitment was strongly affected by the presence and density of conspecifics. After one and 3 months of exposure, numbers of recruits were significantly higher on tiles with conspecific adults than on blank tiles, and there was a positive and significant relationship between the number of recruits and the number of adults in the three treatments assayed. Also, after 3 months of exposure, recruits in all treatments with adults present were larger than recruits in the control treatment. Our results suggest that conspecific adults have a positive effect on recruitment success and growth of newly settled juveniles through factors that enhance larval settling or that contribute to the survival of settlers in areas colonized by adult conspecifics.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Temperature and food interact to influence gamete development in freshwater mussels
AN  - 195895005
AB  - Freshwater mussels are one of the most threatened faunas in North America and worldwide, but little research has examined factors leading to successful reproduction (gamete development and fertilization success) in these species. We combined field and laboratory studies to determine the environmental factors influencing successful reproduction in three closely related species of freshwater mussels in a south central U.S. river. Successful gamete development in the field was linked to temperature, specifically the number of accumulated degree days. Laboratory studies confirmed this finding, but also suggested that temperature and food availability interact to regulate gamete development. Our data indicate that successful reproduction may be inhibited by altered temperature regimes found below impoundments. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Identifying conservation priority ponds of an endangered minnow, Pseudorasbora pumila, in the area invaded by Pseudorasbora parva
AN  - 230001596
AB  - We investigated the occurrence pattern of the pond-living endangered cyprinid, Pseudorasbora pumila, and also compared its habitat characteristics with those of the congeneric invasive species, Pseudorasbora parva, in the contact zone. Comparison of 16 environmental variables among the P. pumila habitats, P. parva habitats, and unoccupied ponds revealed that conductivity was a common limitation factor of distribution of both species. We found that emergent vegetation occupancy along the pond bank was the most important factor determining P. pumila occurrence and that ponds with steep banks may have a low probability of containing P. parva. We constructed a logistic regression model to predict the establishment risk of P. parva in ponds occupied by P. pumila. The model demonstrated that more than half of the ponds exhibited a high establishment risk of P. parva. Principal component analysis using six parameters selected from stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that seven unoccupied ponds had the potential to sustain P. pumila, suggesting that our study site is capable of supporting more P. pumila populations and expanding the current range.

T1  - Long-term ecosystem monitoring and assessment of the Detroit River and Western Lake Erie
AN  - 222003783; 18850284
AB  - Over 35 years of US and Canadian pollution prevention and control efforts have led to substantial improvements in environmental quality of the Detroit River and western Lake Erie. However, the available information also shows that much remains to be done. Improvements in environmental quality have resulted in significant ecological recovery, including increasing populations of bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), peregrine falcons (Falco columbarius), lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens), lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis), walleye (Sander vitreus), and burrowing mayflies (Hexagenia spp.). Although this recovery is remarkable, many challenges remain, including population growth, transportation expansion, and land use changes; nonpoint source pollution; toxic substances contamination; habitat loss and degradation; introduction of exotic species; and greenhouse gases and global warming. Research/monitoring must be sustained for effective management. Priority research and monitoring needs include: demonstrating and quantifying cause-effect relationships; establishing quantitative endpoints and desired future states; determining cumulative impacts and how indicators relate; improving modeling and prediction; prioritizing geographic areas for protection and restoration; and fostering long-term monitoring for adaptive management. Key management agencies, universities, and environmental and conservation organizations should pool resources and undertake comprehensive and integrative assessments of the health of the Detroit River and western Lake Erie at least every 5 years to practice adaptive management for long-term sustainability.

T1  - The role of solid waste materials as habitats for macroinvertebrates in a lowland dam reservoir
AN  - 195889389
AB  - Because of  the increasing anthropogenic pressure, the amount of solid waste discarded in water is growing considerably. It can affect aquatic organisms, modifying their distribution and abundance. This study was designed to investigate the effect of several types of solid waste (bottles, textiles, bundles of string, pieces of polythene and rubber) upon the taxonomic composition and biodiversity of macroinvertebrates inhabiting the near-shore zone (up to 1-m depth) of the Wocawek Reservoir (the River Vistula, central Poland). The epifauna developing on these materials was compared with organisms living on natural substrata: bare sandy bottom (from which the waste was collected), macrophytes and sandy bottom overgrown by plants. The communities inhabiting the artificial substrata (except strings) were much more diverse (in terms of taxon richness, Shannon-Wiener index and evenness) than the surrounding bare sandy bottom. The biodiversity on the waste was similar to that found on the macrophytes and bottom among them, located nearby. The most suitable materials appeared to be bottles, providing shelters in their interiors. The artificial substrata differed considerably from all natural habitats with respect to taxonomic composition, though they were more similar to the macrophytes than to the bottom sediments. Furthermore, the variability among the assemblages developing on the particular waste objects, even of the same type, was much larger than that observed on the macrophytes, indicating the patchy nature of the former habitat. Thus, discarded waste can constitute alternative habitats for invertebrates, especially when natural substrata are unsuitable (e.g. sandy bottom), but they cannot fully replace natural substrata, such as plants, in their habitat-forming role in ecosystems.

T1  - Contaminant concentrations in Asian carps, invasive species in the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers
AN  - 222038557; 18850294
AB  - Populations of invasive fishes quickly reach extremely high biomass. Before control methods can be applied, however, an understanding of the contaminant loads of these invaders carry is needed. We investigated differences in concentrations of selected elements in two invasive carp species as a function of sampling site, fish species, length and trophic differences using stable isotopes (δ                         15N, δ                         13C). Fish were collected from three different sites, the Illinois River near Havana, Illinois, and two sites in the Mississippi River, upstream and downstream of the Illinois River confluence. Five bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) and five silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) from each site were collected for muscle tissue analyses. Freshwater mussels (Amblema plicata) previously collected in the same areas were used as an isotopic baseline to standardize fish results among sites. Total fish length, trophic position, and corrected 13C, were significantly related to concentrations of metals in muscle. Fish length explained the most variation in metal concentrations, with most of that variation related to mercury levels. This result was not unexpected because larger fish are older, giving them a higher probability of exposure and accumulation of contaminants. There was a significant difference in stable isotope profiles between the two species. Bighead carp occupied a higher trophic position and had higher levels of corrected 13C than silver carp. Additionally bighead carp had significantly lower concentrations of arsenic and selenium than silver carp. Stable isotope ratios of nitrogen in Asian carp were at levels that are more commonly associated with higher-level predators, or from organisms in areas containing high loads of wastewater effluent.

T1  - Principal response curves technique for the analysis of multivariate biomonitoring time series
AN  - 222021196; 18484186
AB  - Although chemical and biological monitoring is often used to evaluate the quality of surface waters for regulatory purposes and/or to evaluate environmental status and trends, the resulting biological and chemical data sets are large and difficult to evaluate. Multivariate techniques have long been used to analyse complex data sets. This paper discusses the methods currently in use and introduces the principal response curves method, which overcomes the problem of cluttered graphical results representation that is a great drawback of most conventional methods. To illustrate this, two example data sets are analysed using two ordination techniques, principal component analysis and principal response curves. Whereas PCA results in a difficult-to-interpret diagram, principal response curves related methods are able to show changes in community composition in a diagram that is easy to read. The principal response curves method is used to show trends over time with an internal reference (overall mean or reference year) or external reference (e.g. preferred water quality or reference site). Advantages and disadvantages of both methods are discussed and illustrated. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Assessment of genotoxicity in polluted freshwaters using caged painter's mussel, Unio pictorum
AN  - 214673504; 19199111
AB  - This study was undertaken to evaluate the applicability of caged painter's mussel, Unio pictorum for freshwater environmental genotoxicity assessment. Mussels in cages were exposed for 3 weeks in 2002-2004 to polluted sites in two large rivers in the Croatia, the Sava and Drava, and on the respective reference sites. DNA damage was assessed in haemocytes of the exposed mussels by the comet and micronucleus assays. Both assays provided good discriminative power between polluted and control sites and showed the same gradation of sites according to their genotoxic properties, with high concordance between investigated years. Background levels of the DNA damage in haemocytes of painter's mussels are defined for both assays for easier detection of contamination-related genotoxicity. U. pictorum is found to be a very suitable sentinel species, sufficiently sensitive to the impact of pollution but at the same time unsusceptible to stress caused by translocation or cage exposure.

T1  - Effect of attachment status and aggregation on the behaviour of the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha
AN  - 195502885
AB  - The zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha lives attached to a hard substratum, often in dense aggregations. It can thus be expected that both its attachment status and conspecifics may greatly affect its responses to various environmental stimuli. We studied whether the attachment status influenced mussel relocation frequency and responses to light and gravity in laboratory conditions. We also tested the impact of conspecifics upon mussel attachment strength and relocation frequency. Small (<10 mm) and large (>10 mm) mussels attached for 1 or 6 days relocated from their initial positions less frequently than unattached individuals. Large mussels crawled less often than small individuals, but neither attachment status nor size modified their responses to light: illuminated (100 lx) mussels always moved towards dark areas and changed their initial sites less often than those kept in darkness. On a slope inclined at 8°, unattached small mussels preferred upward movement in darkness whereas large mussels moved similarly in both directions and were less mobile than small individuals. The behaviour of mussels attached for 6 days was reversed: negative geotaxis disappeared in small mussels, while large mussels preferred to crawl upwards and moved more often than small individuals. Aggregated mussels of both size groups were more strongly attached to the substratum and stayed at their initial sites more often than singletons. Our study shows that attachment status and conspecifics can modify responses of zebra mussels to environmental stimuli and should be taken into account in behavioural studies on this species.

T1  - Mechanisms of habitat segregation between an invasive and an indigenous mussel: settlement, post-settlement mortality and recruitment
AN  - 208062816
AB  - The mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis is highly invasive worldwide, but displays varying degrees of local and regional coexistence with indigenous mussels through spatial habitat segregation. We investigated the roles of settlement, post-settlement mortality, juvenile growth and recruitment in partial habitat segregation between the invasive M. galloprovincialis and the indigenous mussel Perna perna on the south coast of South Africa. We used two study locations, Plettenberg Bay and Tsitsikamma, 70 km apart, with two sites (separated by 300-400 m) per location, each divided into three vertical zones. There were no significant effects in Tsitsikamma, where daily settlement and monthly recruitment were significantly lower than in Plettenberg Bay. In Plettenberg Bay, settlement (primary and secondary) and recruitment of both species decreased upshore. Post-settlement mortality was measured over two consecutive 6-day periods during a spring tide and a neap tide. For both species mortality was low on the low-shore. High-shore mortality was consistently low for M. galloprovincialis, but increased dramatically for P. perna during spring tide. No data were obtained for growth of P. perna, but juvenile M. galloprovincialis grew more slowly farther upshore. P. perna recruited mainly in spring and summer, with a peak in summer far greater than for M. galloprovincialis. Recruitment of M. galloprovincialis was more protracted, continuing through autumn and winter. Thus local coexistence is due to a combination of pre- and post-recruitment factors differing in importance for each species. P. perna is excluded from the high-shore by recruitment failure (low settlement, high mortality). High survival and slow growth in juveniles may allow large densities of M. galloprovincialis to accumulate there, despite low settlement rates. With no differences between species in settlement or mortality on the low-shore, exclusion of M. galloprovincialis from that zone is likely to be by post-recruitment processes, possibly strengthened by periodic heavy recruitments of P. perna. At larger scales, larval retention and protracted recruitment contribute to the success of M. galloprovincialis at Plettenberg Bay, while recruitment limitation may explain why M. galloprovincialis is less successful at other sites.

T1  - Resource switching in fish following a major food web disruption
AN  - 199301442; 19214590
AB  - Dreissenid mussels (Dreissena polymorpha and D. bugensis) have re-engineered Great Lakes ecosystems since their introduction in the late 1980s. Dreissenids can have major indirect impacts on profundal habitats by redirecting nutrients and energy away from pelagic production (which supplies profundal production) and depositing nutrients and energy in the nearshore zones that they occupy. However, strong empirical evidence for the effects of this redirection of resources on fish populations is currently lacking. Here, we report significant shifts in isotopic signatures, depth distribution and diets of a coldwater profundal fish population that are all consistent with a greater reliance on nearshore resources after the establishment of dreissenid mussels in South Bay, Lake Huron. Isotopic signatures of scales collected from 5-year-old lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) demonstrated remarkable stability over the 50-year period prior to the establishment of dreissenids (1947-1997) and a sudden and significant change in isotopic signatures (3[per thousand] enrichment in δ13C and 1[per thousand] depletion in δ15N) after their establishment (2001-2005). These dramatic shifts in isotopic signatures were accompanied by a coincident shift in the mean depth of capture of lake whitefish towards the nearshore. A comparison of previously unpublished pre-invasion diets of lake whitefish from South Bay with contemporary diets collected between 2002 and 2005 also indicate a greater reliance on nearshore prey after the invasion of dreissenid mussels. This study is the first to report changes in the carbon source available to lake whitefish associated with restructured benthic communities after the appearance of dreissenid mussels. Further, this study contributes to a growing body of work that demonstrates the ecological insights that can be gained through isotopic analysis of archived fish bony tissues in ecosystems that have experienced significant levels of disturbance.

T1  - Ecosystem engineering and biodiversity in coastal sediments: posing hypotheses
AN  - 205297093
AB  - Coastal sediments in sheltered temperate locations are strongly modified by ecosystem engineering species such as marsh plants, seagrass, and algae as well as by epibenthic and endobenthic invertebrates. These ecosystem engineers are shaping the coastal sea and landscape, control particulate and dissolved material fluxes between the land and sea, and between the benthos and the passing water or air. Above all, habitat engineering exerts facilitating and inhibiting effects on biodiversity. Despite a strongly growing interest in the functional role of ecosystem engineering over the recent years, compared to food web analyses, the conceptual understanding of engineering-mediated species interactions is still in its infancy. In the present paper, we provide a concise overview on current insights and propose two hypotheses on the general mechanisms by which ecosystem engineering may affect biodiversity in coastal sediments. We hypothesise that autogenic and allogenic ecosystem engineers have inverse effects on epibenthic and endobenthic biodiversity in coastal sediments. The primarily autogenic structures of the epibenthos achieve high diversity at the expense of endobenthos, whilst allogenic sediment reworking by infauna may facilitate other infauna and inhibits epibenthos. On a larger scale, these antagonistic processes generate patchiness and habitat diversity. Due to such interaction, anthropogenic influences can strongly modify the engineering community by removing autogenic ecosystem engineers through coastal engineering or bottom trawling. Another source of anthropogenic influences comes from introducing invasive engineers, from which the impact is often hard to predict. We hypothesise that the local biodiversity effects of invasive ecosystem engineers will depend on the engineering strength of the invasive species, with engineering strength defined as the number of habitats it can invade and the extent of modification. At a larger scale of an entire shore, biodiversity need not be decreased by invasive engineers and may even increase. On a global scale, invasive engineers may cause shore biota to converge, especially visually due to the presence of epibenthic structures.

T1  - Overcrowding, food and phosphorus limitation effects on ephipphia production and population dynamics in the invasive species Daphnia lumholtzi
AN  - 195893718
AB  - Daphnia lumholtzi has been very successful in colonizing North America since its appearance in Texas in 1990. Although previous studies have sought to link its success as an invasive species with various aspects of its population biology, there is little experimental data linking the invasion success of D. lumholtzi with its autecology, specifically its reproduction strategy. In this study we sought to link food quality and quantity to diapause in D. lumholtzi through a variation in phosphorus (P) content of algae, food quantity, and light level. We also assessed the effect of Daphnia peak population densities on reproductive rates and production of resting eggs. We found that when food is abundant, per capita ephippia production may be limited by P, but under food limitation conditions, there is no significant effect of food quality on ephippia production. Our results suggest that a combination of food quality/quantity and population density may work together to induce the production of resting eggs in this invasive species. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Reforming Watershed Restoration: Science in Need of Application and Applications in Need of Science
AN  - 229995689
AB  - Coastal and inland waters are continuing to decline in many parts of the world despite major efforts made to restore them. This is due in part to the inadequate role that ecological science has played in shaping restoration efforts. A significant amount of fundamental ecological knowledge dealing with issues such as system dynamics, state changes, context-dependency of ecological response, and diversity is both under-used by managers and practitioners and under-developed by ecologists for use in real-world applications. Some of the science that is being 'used' has not been adequately tested. Thus, restoration ecology as a science and ecological restoration as a practice are in need of reform. I identify five ways in which our ecological knowledge should be influencing restoration to a far greater extent than at present including a need to: shift the focus to restoration of process and identification of the limiting factors instead of structures and single species, add ecological insurance to all projects, identify a probabilistic range of possible outcomes instead of a reference condition, expand the spatial scale of efforts, and apply hierarchical approaches to prioritization. Prominent examples of restoration methods or approaches that are commonly used despite little evidence to support their efficacy are highlighted such as the use of only structural enhancements to restore biodiversity. There are also major gaps in scientific knowledge that are of immediate need to policy makers, managers, and restoration practitioners including: predictive frameworks to guide the restoration of ecological processes, identification of social-ecological feedbacks that constrain ecosystem recovery and data to support decisions of where and how to implement restoration projects to achieve the largest gains. I encourage ecologists to respond to the demand for their scientific input so that restoration can shift from an engineering-driven process to a more sustainable enterprise that fully integrates ecological processes and social science methods.

T1  - Contrasting impacts of invasive engineers on freshwater ecosystems: an experiment and meta-analysis
AN  - 199330014; 18941787
AB  - Invasion by common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) in shallow lakes have been followed by stable-state changes from a macrophyte-dominated clear water state to a phytoplankton-dominated turbid water state. Both invasive carp and crayfish are, therefore, possible drivers for catastrophic regime shifts. Despite these two species having been introduced into ecosystems world-wide, their relative significance on regime shifts remains largely unexplored. We compared the ecological impacts of carp and crayfish on submerged macrophytes, water quality, phytoplankton, nutrient dynamics, zooplankton and benthic macroinvertebrates by combining an enclosure experiment and a meta-analysis. The experiment was designed to examine how water quality and biological variables responded to increasing carp or crayfish biomass. We found that even at a low biomass, carp had large and positive impacts on suspended solids, phytoplankton and nutrients and negative impacts on benthic macroinvertebrates. In contrast, crayfish had a strong negative impact on submerged macrophytes. The impacts of crayfish on macrophytes were significantly greater than those of carp. The meta-analysis showed that both carp and crayfish have significant effects on submerged macrophytes, phytoplankton, nutrient dynamics and benthic macroinvertebrates, while zooplankton are affected by carp but not crayfish. It also indicated that crayfish have significantly greater impacts on macrophytes relative to carp. Overall, the meta-analysis largely supported the results of the experiment. Taken as a whole, our results show that both carp and crayfish have profound effects on community composition and ecosystem processes through combined consequences of bioturbation, excretion, consumption and non-consumptive destruction. However, key variables (e.g. macrophytes) relating to stable-state changes responded differently to increasing carp or crayfish biomass, indicating that they have differential ecosystem impacts.

T1  - Mussel Cultivation to Improve Water Quality in the Szczecin Lagoon
AN  - 1683506673
AB  - According to the EU Water Framework Directive, all surface waters should reach a good ecological status by 2015. While it seems realistic to achieve this objective for the river Oder/Odra itself, the water quality of the Szczecin (Oder-) Lagoon cannot be sufficiently improved through river basin management alone. Therefore, supporting internal measures must be considered. The zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, a species currently inhabiting the whole lagoon, has a high filtration potential. With filtration rates of 3000-4000 l m^sup -2^ d^sup -1^ Dreissena could potentially improve water quality, especially water transparency, which is a key factor for beneficial regional tourism development. Cultivation of mussels, combined with systematic harvest could help to reduce the nutrient content in the Szczecin Lagoon. This article presents the results of a literature-based suitability analysis for cultivating Dreissena polymorpha in the lagoon. Besides ecological and filtration effects, economic utilization of Dreissena is discussed to assess costs and benefits of mussel aquaculture. The results show that selling Dreissena is difficult. Therefore, economic benefits of cultivation are limited. Further financing strategies could be a tourism fee for water quality improvement or nutrient emission certificates.

T1  - A Strategic Plan for the Rehabilitation of Lake Trout in Lake Erie, 2008-2020
AN  - 2012108687
AB  - This report is a revision of the original Lake Erie Lake Trout Restoration Plan of 1985. This revised plan comprises the history of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) rehabilitation efforts in Lake Erie, overview of current population, impediments to lake trout rehabilitation, new goals and objectives, and management strategies to achieve these new goals. The report also outlines assessment and research needs by jurisdiction as well as agency roles and responsibilities. The new goals recommend a combination of better sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) control, increased stocking of up to at least 200,000 yearlings annually, and identification of potential lake trout spawning areas. Other management strategies include: expanding the number of stocking sites, rotating stocking areas, maintaining genetic diversity of stocked fish, and maintaining adult survival rates of at least 60%. Progress toward rehabilitation objectives should be monitored through annual surveys and assessment of primary spawning areas with a focus on whether the goal of detecting naturally produced recruits by 2030 can be met.

T1  - Effects of water-depth and water-level fluctuations on the macroinvertebrate community structure in the littoral zone of Lake Constance
AN  - 821398197
AB  - In a 2-year field study, abundance, biomass and community structure of benthic macroinvertebrates and their seasonal dynamics were assessed along the depth gradient in the stony littoral zone of Lake Constance, Central Europe. The macroinvertebrate community patterns differed significantly between the depth zones, partly because of species turnover, but mostly as a result of different dominance structures. These distinct differences should be considered when designing surveys of benthic invertebrates also for applied purposes, since sources of variation should be kept small and particularly on hard substrates, extensive efforts are required to obtain sufficient data for a powerful statistical analysis. A large seasonal variability in the macroinvertebrate communities of the eulittoral zone indicates a strong influence of physical disturbances, particularly of water-level fluctuations. The community pattern of the drift line samples was influenced by the previous development of the water level. The cumulated water-level fluctuations and their net tendency accounted for three quarters of the variation in a PCA. Since Lake Constance is the only large pre-alpine lake whose water level is not extensively regulated, the uniqueness of the littoral community should have implications for nature conservation measures.

T1  - Effects of water-level fluctuations on lakes: an annotated bibliography
AN  - 821398140
AB  - Water-level fluctuations (WLF) in lakes and rivers, especially their extent, frequency and duration, are dominant forces controlling the functioning of these ecosystems. In particular, WLF play an important role in the lake’s littoral and aquatic–terrestrial interface processes. WLF may take place on different spatial and temporal scales under natural conditions but water levels have been artificially modified in regulated lakes, and their impacts are expected to be enhanced within the actual global change scenarios with forthcoming management problems. This article presents an overview on the literature published on this important topic since 1991 by using journals indexed in the ISI Web of Knowledge. The overall objective was to examine temporal and spatial trends in publications on WLF, the specific aspect of WLF concerned and their main effects. Throughout the article we have used case studies to illustrate different effects of WLF on the variety of lake habitats and indicators that have been studied. Overall, the number of papers published on the subject since the 1990s has risen steadily, when less than ten papers were published each year; until 2006 and peaking in 2005. The greatest number of papers on WLF has been carried out in Europe and North America (c. 73%). These data also showed that the effects of WLF have not been studied equally for different groups of organisms. There is a greater interest on macrophytes, which are the most studied group of organisms (18.4% of the papers). Nearly 7% of the papers deal with algae, and zooplankton and invertebrates account for a 7% followed by fish. WLF effects on ecosystems are very complex, and the biological effects in lakes are greatest in shallow water and littoral areas, where even small changes in water levels can result in the conversion of large areas of a standing-water environment in air exposed habitats. Finally, these data might serve to highlight knowledge gaps still existing on this topic and, in particular, some of the approaches that can potentially contribute to solve several of these lacunae are explored.

T1  - A trait-based approach to species' roles in stream ecosystems: climate change, community structure, and material cycling
AN  - 199336758; 18795337
AB  - The sustained decline in habitat quality and community integrity highlights the importance of understanding how communities and environmental variation interactively contribute to ecosystem services. We performed a laboratory experiment manipulating effects of acclimation temperature (5, 15, 25, and 35°C) on resource acquisition, assimilation and subsequent ecosystem services provided by eight freshwater mussel species. Our results suggest that although freshwater mussels are broadly categorized as filter feeders, there are distinct nested functional guilds (thermally tolerant and sensitive) associated with their thermal performance. At 35°C, thermally tolerant species have increased resource assimilation and higher rates of contributed ecosystem services (nutrient excretion, benthic-pelagic coupling). Conversely, thermally sensitive species have decreased assimilation rates and display an array of functional responses including increased/decreased benthic-pelagic coupling and nutrient excretion. Although thermally sensitive species may be in poorer physiological condition at warmer temperatures, their physiological responses can have positive effects on ecosystem services. We extrapolated these results to real mussel beds varying in species composition to address how shifts in community composition coupled with climate change may shift their contributed ecological services. Comparative field data indicate that two co-existing, abundant species with opposing thermal performance (Actinonaias ligamentina, Amblema plicata) differentially dominate community biomass. Additionally, communities varying in the relative proportion of these species differentially influence the magnitude (benthic-pelagic coupling) and quality (N:P excretion) of ecosystem services. As species are increasingly threatened by climate change, greater emphasis should be placed on understanding the contribution of physiological stress to the integrity and functioning of ecosystems.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The kudzu connection: Exploring the link between land use and invasive species
AN  - 20056014; 8809741
AB  - From kudzu to zebra mussels, invasive species have wreaked environmental and economic havoc by modifying ecosystems, damaging crops, threatening native species, and serving as hosts to pests and viruses. Invasive species are a clearly a problem - but are they a land use problem? This study establishes a potential nexus between land use planning and biological invasions, or bioinvasions. The study also identifies the types of regulatory and non-regulatory tools used by local governments to address invasive species, including bans and ordinances, planning and policies, permit requirements, partnerships and projects, education, and other strategies.

T1  - Ontogenetic variability in the external morphology of monkey goby, Neogobius fluviatilis (Pallas, 1814) and its relevance to invasion potential
AN  - 195899107
AB  - In the previous decade, four species of non-native gobies have invaded the middle section of the river Danube and its tributaries. An effective tool for understanding biological invasions is the evaluation of various biological traits (morphological, life history, ontogenetic) within an epigenetic context. The present study examines the external morphology of monkey goby Neogobius fluviatilis (Pallas, 1814) from the mouth of the River Hron, the morphological differences among three goby species (monkey, bighead and round) and the relevance of these differences for invasive potential. Monkey goby reach their definite phenotype very early in their ontogeny and thus represent a strongly precocial (specialized) species with direct development. The morphological differences between monkey and two other goby species also reflect its strong specialization for sandy substrata and smaller prey types. Thus, monkey goby are not expected to spread to new areas as fast as the round and bighead gobies, and their distribution is likely to be limited to sandy and/or sandy-gravel substrata. If this assumption is correct, then the potential adverse impact of monkey goby on native fauna or even ecosystem is likely to be less than that of the bighead and round gobies.

T1  - A shift in the habitat use pattern of a lentic galaxiid fish: an acute behavioural response to an introduced predator
AN  - 2664665778
AB  - Despite potentially reducing predation mortality, behavioural responses of native species to introduced predators may still have sub-lethal impacts. In video-recorded laboratory trials, we examined the effects of introduced brown trout, Salmo trutta, on the short-term behaviour of a threatened, lake-dwelling galaxiid fish and confirmed a suspected diel pattern in habitat use by this species. We found that Galaxias auratus followed a distinct diel pattern in the use of complex habitats and open water, which was significantly altered by the presence of brown trout. In trials without the introduced predator, G. auratus used complex habitats (rocks or macrophytes) during the day, and open water during the night. In trials with brown trout present, G. auratus spent significantly less time in open water and rarely ventured out of the macrophytes. However, when given the option of using only rocky substrate or open water, which is the more common situation in the lakes to which this galaxiid is endemic, the fish reduced the amount of time they spent in the open water during the night, but still spent more time in open water than when macrophytes were available. Spending the daylight hours amongst the cover of rocks or macrophytes is most likely an adaptation to reduce the risk of predation by visual predators, and the pattern of reduced use of open water habitats in the presence of brown trout is an acute response to the close proximity of the introduced predator. The difference in the nocturnal use of macrophytes and rocks when trout are present may be related to differences in feeding opportunities or success within these habitats.

T1  - Growth chronologies of white sucker, Catostomus commersoni, and lake trout, Salvelinus namaycush: a comparison among lakes and between trophic levels
AN  - 208182924
AB  - A growth chronology index was used to determine whether changes in ecosystem structure and function in lakes could be associated with fish growth histories. Growth chronologies were compared for white suckers, Catostomus commersoni, from Little Moose (oligotrophic), Oneida (eutrophic), and Cayuga (mesotrophic) lakes (New York) from opercular bone growth increments, and for lake trout, Salvelinus namaycush, from Little Moose Lake using otolith growth. The longevity of these species allowed the development of chronologies from 17 to 33 years in length using only contemporary collections. We used these chronologies to examine whether fish growth histories could be used as an index for ecosystem-scale changes. Specifically, we examined whether zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, invasion in Oneida and Cayuga lakes in the early 1990s, and treatment of sewage effluent from dwellings around Little Moose Lake beginning during the late 1980s could be detected in white sucker and lake trout growth chronologies. White sucker growth in Oneida and Cayuga Lakes did not differ before and after zebra mussel invasions. Neither white sucker nor lake trout growth chronologies from Little Moose Lake reflect changes in growth expected with reduced productivity levels associated with improved sewage treatment. Growth chronologies of these two species did not detect the ecosystem-scale changes that occurred in the study lakes.  (PUBLICATION ABSTRACT)

T1  - Movements of wintering surf scoters: predator responses to different prey landscapes
AN  - 199252294; 18210158
AB  - The distribution of predators is widely recognized to be intimately linked to the distribution of their prey. Foraging theory suggests that predators will modify their behaviors, including movements, to optimize net energy intake when faced with variation in prey attributes or abundance. While many studies have documented changes in movement patterns of animals in response to temporal changes in food, very few have contrasted movements of a single predator species naturally occurring in dramatically different prey landscapes. We documented variation in the winter movements, foraging range size, site fidelity, and distribution patterns of a molluscivorous sea duck, the surf scoter (Melanitta perspicillata), in two areas of coastal British Columbia with very different shellfish prey features. Baynes Sound has extensive tidal flats with abundant clams, which are high-quality and temporally stable prey for scoters. Malaspina Inlet is a rocky fjord-like inlet where scoters consume mussels that are superabundant and easily accessible in some patches but are heavily depleted over the course of winter. We used radio telemetry to track surf scoter movements in both areas and found that in the clam habitats of Baynes Sound, surf scoters exhibited limited movement, small winter ranges, strong foraging site fidelity, and very consistent distribution patterns. By contrast, in mussel habitats in the Malaspina Inlet, surf scoters displayed more movement, larger ranges, little fidelity to specific foraging sites, and more variable distribution patterns. We conclude that features associated with the different prey types, particularly the higher depletion rates of mussels, strongly influenced seasonal space use patterns. These findings are consistent with foraging theory and confirm that predator behavior, specifically movements, is environmentally mediated.

T1  - Sand and wave induced mortality in invasive (Mytilus galloprovincialis) and indigenous (Perna perna) mussels
AN  - 208062540
AB  - The ability of an invasive species to spread in a new locality depends on its interaction with the indigenous community and on variation in time and space in the environment. The Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis invaded the South African coast 30 years ago and it now competes and coexists with the indigenous mussel Perna perna. The two species show different tolerances to wave and sand stress, two of the main environmental factors affecting this intertidal community. P. perna is more resistant to hydrodynamic stress than M. galloprovincialis, while the invasive species is less vulnerable to sand action. Our results show that mortality rates of the two species over a period of 6 months had different timing. The indigenous species had higher mortality than M. galloprovincialis during periods of high sand accumulation in mussel beds, while the pattern reversed during winter, when wave action was high. A negative correlation between sand accumulation and attachment strength of the two mussels showed that sand not only affects mussel mortality through scouring and burial, but also weakens their attachment strength, subjecting them to a higher risk of dislodgement. Here we underline the importance of variations in time and space of environmental stress in regulating the interaction between invasive and indigenous species, and how these variations can create new competitive balances.

T1  - Phytoplankton dynamics in nearshore and offshore regions of the Great Lakes Erie, Malawi, Tanganyika, and Victoria.
AN  - 21082940; 11244933
AB  - My doctoral thesis challenges the traditional paradigm of phosphorus (P) limitation of phytoplankton communities in freshwaters by suggesting colimitation of P, nitrogen (N), and iron (Fe) in Great Lakes. Oceanographers have recognized Fe, N and P colimitation, and biomass response to Fe is documented in freshwater lakes. I studied African and North American Great Lakes that are similar to large inland oceans. I discovered that Fe is a key nutrient that is often limiting in the offshore, and may explain the dominance of cyanobacteria in nutrient enriched lakes. I also discovered that the nearshore and offshore areas of these large lakes are very different, particularly when invasive dreissenid mussels are impacting the nearshore, as seen in the eastern basin of Lake Erie. As a result of the dreissenids, chlorophyll a (chla) concentrations are significantly lower in the nearshore of Lake Erie, but higher in the nearshore in the three African Great Lakes, as well as pre-dreissenid Lake Erie. The objective of my thesis was to determine the limiting nutrient(s) to the phytoplankton of the Great Lakes Erie, Malawi, Tanganyika, and Victoria in both the nearshore and offshore by measuring the physiological status of the phytoplankton. I also examined how dreissenids affect the distribution of seston and nutrient concentrations between the nearshore and offshore of the eastern basin of Lake Erie. My study design included temporal and spatial surveys in the nearshore and offshore of the four lakes, in which I used a variety of nutrient limitation indicators for P (C:P, N:P, P debt, APA, F sub(v)/F sub(m)), N (C:N, NH sub(4) debt, NO sub(3) debt, F sub(v)/F sub(m)), and Fe (F sub(v)/F sub( m)), as well as photosynthetic efficiency (F sub(v)/F sub(m)) experiments. Nutrient enrichment experiments were also conducted in the nearshore and offshore of the eastern basin of Lake Erie which involved the addition and removal of Fe alone, as well as in combination with P and/or N. Lake Erie nutrient enrichment experiments provided evidence for P, N and Fe colimitation where the addition of Fe with P relieved Fe and P limitation and allowed nitrate (NO sub(3) super(-)) assimilation, alleviating N limitation. However, the offshore experiments indicated stronger Fe limitation than the nearshore experiment. Lower chla concentrations in the post-dreissenid nearshore of the eastern basin of Lake Erie may not be due entirely to lower phytoplankton biomass, as photoacclimation of the phytoplankton may also be occurring. Dreissenid grazing effects can be seen in the distribution of dissolved nutrient concentrations between the nearshore and offshore of post-dreissenid Erie. The African Great Lakes are threatened by expanding human populations, resulting in increased nutrient runoff; the consequences of which will depend on the limiting nutrient(s). I found that the nearshore regions of Lakes Malawi and Tanganyika were colimited by N and P, while the offshore regions were colimited by N, P and Fe. The nearshore of Lake Victoria was colimited by light and N, while the offshore was colimited by N, P and Fe. Fe limitation only occurs in the offshore, and positive, significant relationships were found between total dissolved Fe concentrations and cyanobacteria. Continued P and Fe loading to the lakes will create a higher N demand that will result in a shift to N sub(2)-fixing cyanobacteria, which has serious consequences to human and ecosystem health as they are a poor nutritive food source and some are potentially toxigenic. The majority of studies conducted on Great Lakes involve offshore sampling, however, the less understood nearshore is where human impacts and activities are concentrated. I discovered there are significant differences between the nearshore and offshore, which has implications for water quality monitoring.

T1  - Foraging Behavior of Surf Scoters (Melanitta Perspicillata)and White-Winged Scoters (M. Fusca) in Relation to Clam Density: Inferring Food Availability and Habitat Quality
AN  - 196447437
AB  - Birds are known to modify their foraging behavior in relation to food availability. Once understood, these relationships can be used to draw inferences about relative food availability and habitat quality. We measured foraging behavior of Surf Scoters (Melanitta perspicillata  ) and White-winged Scoters (M. fusca  ) feeding on clams during winter in the Strait of Georgia, British Columbia, to evaluate the relative quality of the foraging landscape for wintering scoters. Because clam biomass does not increase appreciably during winter through growth or recruitment, scoters are faced with a depleting and potentially exhaustible food supply. Along with this temporal variation, clam densities vary widely by site. We considered the influence of variation in clam density on scoter foraging behavior, along with other factors known to affect foraging in other sea duck species, such as season, sex, age, and environmental attributes. Clam-capture success (clams captured per dive) and foraging effort (minutes underwater per hour) of Surf Scoters were not related to variation in clam density. Clam-capture success of White-winged Scoters was unrelated to clam density; however, their foraging effort was negatively related to clam density, though varying by only 4 min across the range of observed clam densities. For both species, foraging behavior was generally more strongly related to other factors, especially seasonal and age effects. These results suggest that (1) observed variation in clam density was relatively minor from the perspective of foraging scoters and (2) our study site constituted high-quality winter habitat in which scoters were not constrained by food availability.

T1  - Global diversity of freshwater mussels (Mollusca, Bivalvia) in freshwater
AN  - 195882852
AB  - The term freshwater bivalve is very inclusive and not very informative. There are representatives of at least 19 families that have at least one representative living in freshwater. This suggests at least 14 different invasions of freshwater. At least nine families have small to large radiations in the freshwater environment: Corbiculidae, Sphaeriidae, Dreissenidae, and the unioniforme families: Hyriidae, Margaritiferidae, Unionidae, Etheriidae, Iridinidae, and Mycetopodidae. The unioniforme families contain at least 180 genera and about 800 species. This order is characterized by the unique parasitic larval stage on the gills, fins or the body of a particular host fish. This order of freshwater bivalves is suffering a very high rate of extinction, with about 37 species considered presumed extinct in North America alone. The level of endangerment and extinction facing these animals is primarily the result of habitat destruction or modification.  (PUBLICATION ABSTRACT)

T1  - Global diversity of polychaetes (Polychaeta; Annelida) in freshwater
AN  - 195882791
AB  - A literature review of Polychaeta (Annelida) including Aphanoneura (the oligochaete-like Aeolosomatidae and Potamodrilidae), living in freshwater yielded 168 species, 70 genera and 24 families representing all of the major polychaete clades, but less than 2% of all species. The best-represented families were, in order, Nereididae, Aeolosomatidae, Sabellidae, Spionidae and Histriobdellidae. Fourteen families were represented by a single species and genus. Regions supporting the highest diversity of freshwater polychaetes were in order, Palaearctic, Neotropical, Oriental, Nearctic, Australasian, and Afrotropical. More than half of all species and genera inhabitat lakes and rivers, followed by lagoons/estuaries, which have a high proportion of euryhaline species, and inland seas. Less common, atypical polychaete habitats include subterranean waters, the hyporheic zone of rivers and plant container habitats (phytotelmata). At least three distinct ecological/historical processes appear to account for the colonisation of continental waters: invasion of a clade prior to the break-up of Gondwana, as in Aphanoneura, Namanereis, Stratiodrilus, and Caobangia; relatively recent stranding of individual species (relicts); and the temporary visitation of euryhaline species.

T1  - A management framework for preventing the secondary spread of aquatic invasive species
AN  - 19380565; 8491544
AB  - Biological invasions continue to accelerate, and there is a need for closer integration between invasive species research and on-the-ground management. In many regions, aquatic invasive species have established isolated populations, but have not yet spread to many sites that provide suitable habitat. In the Laurentian Great Lakes region, several Great Lakes invaders such as zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha), rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax), and spiny water flea (Bythotrephes longimanus) are currently undergoing secondary spread to the smaller inland lakes and streams. This paper describes recent advances in forecasting the secondary spread of aquatic invasive species and presents a framework for assessing vulnerability of inland waters based on explicit assessment of three distinct aspects of biological invasions: colonization, site suitability, and adverse impact. In many cases, only a fraction of lakes on the landscape are vulnerable to specific invasive species, highlighting the potential application of this type of research for improving invasive species management. Effective application to on-the-ground resource management will require that research aimed at assessing site vulnerability be translated into management tools.Original Abstract: Les invasions biologiques continuent aaugmenter en nombre, c'est pourquoi il est necessaire de mieux integrer la recherche sur les especes envahissantes et leur gestion sur le terrain. Dans plusieurs regions, les especes aquatiques envahissantes ont etabli des populations isolees, mais ne se sont pas encore propagees dans plusieurs sites qui constituent des habitats appropries. C'est le cas de la region des Grands Lacs laurentiens où des especes qui ont envahi les Grands Lacs, telles que les moules zebrees (Dreissena polymorpha), l'eperlan arc-en-ciel (Osmerus mordax) et la puce d'eau epineuse (Bythotrephes longimanus), sont actuellement en train d'etendre secondairement leur repartition aux petits lacs et cours d'eau de l'interieur des terres. Notre travail fait la synthese des developpements recents dans la prediction de la dispersion secondaire des especes aquatiques envahissantes et presente un cadre pour evaluer la vulnerabilite des eaux interieures d'apres une determination explicite de trois aspects differents des invasions biologiques, soit la colonisation, la convenance des sites et l'impact negatif. Souvent, seule une fraction des lacs dans un paysage sont vulnerables aune espece envahissante donnee, ce qui demontre l'interet potentiel de ce genre de recherche pour l'amelioration de la gestion des especes envahissantes. Une application efficace aKLKLKLgestion des ressources sur le terrain requerra cependant que la recherche sur l'evaluation de la vulnerabilite des sites soit incorporee dans des outils de gestion.

T1  - Testing a molecular protocol to monitor the presence of golden mussel larvae (Limnoperna fortunei) in plankton samples
AN  - 220273348
AB  - The golden mussel (Limnoperna fortunei, Mollusca: Mytilidae) is an emerging invasive species in freshwater environments in South America, causing extensive environmental and economic impacts. A molecular method to detect larvae of the golden mussel in plankton samples has been recently developed and holds promise for becoming an important way to monitor the expansion of golden mussel populations. In the present study, we conduct, for the first time, field tests of this method by comparing its performance with alternative sampling efforts (microscopy and manual search for adults). In addition, we test different modifications of the molecular method to deal with PCR inhibition in environmental samples. The results indicate that the molecular method is very efficient, being faster and more sensitive that microscopy methods. Therefore, the molecular method tested in the present study can represent an invaluable tool in large-scale monitoring efforts of the golden mussel throughout its introduced range.

T1  - Predictive Modeling of Freshwater Mussel Distributions in the Appalachians
AN  - 19798036; 8380383
AB  - The eastern United States contains the greatest diversity and the most imperiled species of freshwater mussels in the world. Conservation efforts are underway, yet little information is available on current and historical distributions for most species. Current knowledge of freshwater mussel species distributions is limited to data available from museum collections, small-scale studies, and Natural Heritage surveys. The accuracy and precision of these data vary considerably. We obtained the best available information on the range of freshwater mussel species to model the distribution of selected species within the Appalachians. We included in model development anthropogenic and environmental variables, such as slope, elevation, acid deposition, soil buffering capacity, flow accumulation, density of dams, density of roads, and density of zebra mussel occurrences, believed to influence freshwater ecosystems. For each species, we applied the models derived from known species occurrences to sites within the study area where the status of the species is unknown to create maps of predicted species distributions. Our study provides another example of the application of predictive modeling at a regional scale using the best available data. However, our study differs from similar regional studies in its focus on multiple species within a taxon rather than a single species. Knowledge of the predicted distribution of these species in a large portion of their range is an important consideration in regional conservation decisions. In addition, variables that were retained in the models for each species are those that may limit the distributions of freshwater mussels in particular areas of the Appalachians; therefore, these influences can be targeted in future studies and conservation efforts.

T1  - The invasive bivalve <i>Limnoperna fortunei</i> enhances benthic invertebrate densities in South American floodplain rivers
AN  - 845178067
AB  - We assessed the effects of the introduced bivalve L. fortunei on the abundance and biomass of associated benthic invertebrates in South American large floodplain rivers. The survey was based on comparisons of L. fortunei-covered and L. fortunei-barren areas in five artificial cages from where large predators were excluded, exposed to colonization by the mussel for a total of 17 months in the lower Paraná river delta. Accompanying invertebrates were dominated by Oligochaeta, Nematoda, Rotifera, Copepoda, Gastropoda, Hirudinea, Chironomidae and nauplii. Also present in minor numbers were Tardigrada, Turbellaria, Cladocera, Ostracoda, Insecta, Hydracarina and Decapoda. Dominant invertebrates were 27–100% more numerous (and hosted 43–100% more biomass) in areas with L. fortunei than in areas barren of the mussel. In areas with L. fortunei, total invertebrate biomass (excluding the bivalve) was positively correlated with mussel biomass, and increased with time of exposure under water. No such trend was observed in areas barren of L. fortunei. It is suggested that higher invertebrate growth is associated with enhanced substrate complexity and, probably, the transfer of organic matter from the plankton to the sediments due to the mussels’ feces and pseudofeces. Some of the adverse ecosystem-wide effects of filter-feeding invasive mussels observed in European and North American water bodies may be offset in the Paraná by the extremely high loads of organic matter in these turbid waters.

T1  - Larvae of the invasive species <i>Limnoperna fortunei</i> (Bivalvia) in the diet of fish larvae in the Paraná River, Argentina
AN  - 821229041
AB  - To assess the trophic impact of the planktonic larvae of the invasive Asian bivalve Limnoperna fortunei, introduced in South America around 1990, we investigated the gut contents of fish larvae collected at monthly intervals between October 2000 and March 2001 at three locations along a 600 km stretch of the Paraná River, and during November 2004 in two areas of marginal lagoons connected to the river near the city of San Nicolás, Argentina. Zooplankton was also collected in the lagoons in 2004. In total, 11,956 fish larvae were retrieved, of which 1,511 were used for detailed analyses. Of the 15 fish taxa collected, 11 had veligers of L. fortunei in their gut. Fish larvae with empty guts represented 60% (San Nicolás) to 72% (Paraná River) of the total number of fish. Proportions of feeding fish larvae with L. fortunei veligers in their guts varied between 20% (San Nicolás) and 56% (Paraná River); in 15% of the guts analyzed, L. fortunei was the only food item recorded. For those specimens that had consumed L. fortunei larvae and any other food item, L. fortunei was the most important item in 55% (Paraná River) to 71% (San Nicolás) of the animals in terms of biomass. No major temporal or spatial changes in the diet were observed along the Paraná River, but the relative biomass contribution of L. fortunei larvae differed strongly in fishes of different developmental stage. In protolarvae and mesolarvae, veligers accounted for 30–35% of the gut contents. In metalarvae, veligers accounted for only 3%, indicating enhanced food supply for the earliest fish life stages. Comparison of the relative proportions of the three main zooplankton types (L. fortunei veligers, cladocerans, and copepods) in the water and in larval fish guts indicates that L. fortunei is always selected positively over the other two prey types. While our results strongly suggest that the expansion of L. fortunei results in an enhanced food supply for local fish populations, they do not necessarily imply that the overall effect on the ecosystem in general, and on the fish fauna in particular is beneficial.

T1  - Macro-invertebrates in a dynamic river environment: analysis of time series from artificial substrates, using a ‘white box’ neural network modelling method
AN  - 751543499
AB  - New statistical modelling methods, such as neural networks (NNs), allow us to take a step further in the understanding of complex relations in aquatic ecosystems. In this paper the results from the analysis of macro-invertebrate communities in a complex riverine environment are presented. We attempted to explain observed changes in species composition and abundance with neural network modelling methods and compared the results to linear regression. The NN method used is an improved form of the RF5 algorithm, developed to effectively discover numeric laws from data. RF5 uses Product Unit Networks (PUNs), which are in effect multivariate non-discrete power functions. The data set consisted of a 10-year time series of monthly samples of macro-invertebrates on artificial substrates in the rivers Rhine and Meuse in the Netherlands. During this period the invertebrate community has largely changed coinciding with the␣invasion of Ponto-Caspian crustaceans. We used physical–chemical data and data on the abundance of the invasive taxa Corophium curvispinum and Dikerogammarus villosis to explain the observed changes in the resident invertebrate community. The analyses showed temperature, abundance of invasive taxa and peak discharges as important factors. Comparison of the results from NN modelling to linear regression revealed that the factors temperature and abundance of Dikerogammarusvillosis explained equally well in both cases. Only the neural network was able to use information on peak discharge and timing of the peak in the previous winter to improve model performances. Neural networks are known to yield excellent modelling results, a drawback however is their lack of transparency or their ‘black box’ character. The use of relatively easy interpretable (white box) PUNs allows us to investigate the extracted relations in more detail and can enhance our understanding of ecosystem functioning. Our results show that peak discharges might be an important factor structuring invertebrate communities in rivers and hint on the existence of interacting effects from invasive species and discharge peaks. They finally show the value of biological data sets that are collected over a long period and in a highly standardised way.

T1  - Use of Stable Nitrogen Isotopes and Permeable Membrane Devices to Study what Factors Influence Freshwater Mollusk Survival in the Conasauaga River
AN  - 499199054; 17253113
AB  - Recent biological inventory data shows severe declines in freshwater mussel abundance and biodiversity in the Conasauga River Basin in Northwest Georgia, USA. Based on assessments of habitat conditions, mussel populations should be sustainable. We conducted a study of sediment and water quality to evaluate the impact of anthropogenic contamination on mussel populations. Permeable membrane devices (PMD), polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS(TM)), conventional water and sediment quality analyses, and stable nitrogen isotope ratio analyses (δ^sup 15^N) of snails and sediments were used to assess sediment and water quality at target sites throughout the basin. Ambient concentrations of organic contaminants in water were well below any aquatic life criteria; concentrations of some nutrients were detected above aquatic life criteria levels. Most mussel species in the river are endangered or threatened; therefore, snails were collected for δ^sup 15^N analyses. Mean δ^sup 15^N values for snails collected at forested upper watershed sites (national forest areas) were significantly lower than δ^sup 15^N values from snails in agricultural areas. δ^sup 15^N values for raw cow manure and manure-treated soil were similar to δ^sup 15^N values for snails collected in agricultural areas. Dissolved nitrate from water samples had elevated δ^sup 15^N values similar to the upper range of δ^sup 15^N values for snails in agricultural areas. Data, particularly stable nitrogen isotope data, indicates that a land use change from national forest land to agriculture alters nitrogen sources to the basin and snails. Implications of nutrient release on freshwater molluscan reproduction, growth, and survival are discussed.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Comparative vulnerability to predators, and induced defense responses, of eastern oysters Crassostrea virginica and non-native Crassostrea ariakensis oysters in Chesapeake Bay
AN  - 208061866
AB  - Management agencies are considering introducing the Suminoe oyster Crassostrea ariakensis into Chesapeake Bay, USA. It is unknown if the growth of feral populations of this non-native oyster would be regulated by the same predators that once controlled the abundance of the native eastern oyster C. virginica. In laboratory studies, we compared the relative susceptibility of juvenile diploids (shell height < 25 mm) of both oyster species to invertebrate predators of eastern oyster juveniles. Predators included four species of mud crabs [Rhithropanopeus harrisii (carapace width 7-11 mm), Eurypanopeus depressus (6-21 mm), Dyspanopeus sayi (8-20 mm), and Panopeus herbstii (9-29 mm)], the blue crab Callinectes sapidus (35-65 mm), and two sizes of polyclad flatworms (Stylochus ellipticus and possibly Euplana gracilis; planar area 5 mm2 and ~14 to 88 mm2). All four species of mud crab and the blue crab preyed significantly (ANOVA, P = 0.05) more on C. ariakensis than on C. virginica, but predation by flatworms of both sizes did not differ significantly between oyster species. The greater susceptibility of C. ariakensis to crab predation was likely due to its shell compression strength being 64% lower than that of C. virginica (P = 0.005). To test for predator-induced enhancement of shell strength, we held oysters of both species for 54 days in the presence of, but protected from, C. sapidus and R. harrisii. Crabs were fed congeneric oysters twice weekly within each aquarium. Compared to controls, shell strength of C. virginica exposed to R. harrisii increased significantly (P < 0.043), as did shell strength of both oyster species exposed to C. sapidus (P < 0.01). Despite the changes in shell strength by both oyster species in the presence of C. sapidus, the shell of C. ariakensis remained 57% weaker than C. virginica. We conclude that, because C. ariakensis exposed to predators continued to have a weaker shell relative to C. virginica, the natural suite of crab and flatworm predators in Chesapeake Bay will likely serve to control the abundance of feral C. ariakensis. We caution that the situation in the natural environment may be sufficiently different in some locations that C. ariakensis may be able to compensate for its greater vulnerability to crab predation and hence become a nuisance species.

T1  - The reproductive biology of the depressed river mussel, Pseudanodonta complanata (Bivalvia: Unionidae), with implications for its conservation
AN  - 195516710
AB  - ABSTRACT

              
Pseudanodonta complanata  is listed as 'Near Threatened' on the IUCN Red List (IUCN, 2006) and is a species of conservation priority on the UK Biodiversity Action Plan. The UK is host to some of the largest populations of this species, but little is known about their reproductive biology. Two populations were studied in the Great Ouse catchment and the Waveney and Yare catchment, East Anglia, UK. Both populations are reproductively active, producing viable glochidia. Small mussels (<30 mm length) in both catchments indicate that recruitment is occurring. A short non-gravid period in May is followed by three months of glochidial formation in June, July and August; by September mussels contain mature glochidia ready for release the following April. Females brood between 5,000 and 50,000 glochidia, and this scales with mussel length L (mm) as: n
gloch ∝L2.1 . The sex ratio is skewed towards females (2.5 females:1 male), and males are larger than females. No hermaphrodites were found during the histological examination of the gonads of 24 mussels. The in vivo  examination of demibranchs is shown to be an effective nonsacrificial means of determining sex and gravidity. Conservation recommendations include: minimizing management operations in river stretches containing large populations; avoiding forms of management which preferentially remove large mussels (i.e. males and the most fecund females); performing management during the non-gravid period to avoid causing the premature release of glochidia; leaving sufficient time between management operations for populations to recover; and temporarily translocating mussels to refugia during management operations.

T1  - Using movements and diet analyses to assess effects of introduced muskellunge (<i>Esox masquinongy</i>) on Atlantic salmon (<i>Salmo salar</i>) in the Saint John River, New Brunswick
AN  - 2665410788
AB  - The muskellunge was introduced in the Saint John River system from stockings in a headwater lake in the 1970s. They have migrated down the system as far as the river’s first dam, Mactaquac Hydroelectric Facility, at Fredericton and appear to have established several reproducing populations along the river. This exotic invader represents a potential threat to the severely depleted Atlantic salmon stocks in the river. We radio-tracked muskellunge over a 2-year period in the middle reaches. Home ranges extended to ∼100 km in both riverine and lacustrine areas, including 78% of individuals trans-located upstream of the dam making their way back through the dam successfully. Downstream of the dam, home ranges were <25 km. No spawning areas were detected. An isotope analyses of diet indicated that the large sub-adults and adults had established the greatest proportion of their biomass in a more 15N depleted environment typical of areas farther upstream. Isotope mixing models could not accurately determine the proportion of Atlantic salmon smolts that may have been consumed by muskellunge, but anadromous salmon had ≤7% probabilities of being in the diet. A bioenergetics model suggested ≤5% of the annual food intake by muskellunge occurs during the smolt out-migration period. For the Saint John River, the impacts of growing numbers of muskellunge are multi-faceted creating a complex management challenge. Muskellunge appear to minimally increase predation risk for Atlantic salmon smolts while their increasing numbers are creating a growing recreational fishery and potential threat to the native fish community and ecosystem.

T1  - Temporal and spatial variability in stable isotope compositions of a freshwater mussel: implications for biomonitoring and ecological studies
AN  - 818894695
AB  - Stable isotopes can be used to elucidate ecological relationships in community and trophic studies. Findings are calibrated against baselines, e.g. from a producer or primary consumer, assumed to act as a reference to the isotopic context created by spatio-temporal attributes such as geography, climate, nutrient, and energy sources. The ability of an organism to accurately represent a community base depends on how, and over what time-scale, it assimilates ambient materials. Freshwater mussels have served as references for trophic studies of freshwater communities and as indicators of change in nutrient pollution load or source. Their suitability as reference animals has not yet been fully explored, however. We conducted a series of studies examining the suitability of freshwater mussels as isotopic baselines, using their ability to reflect variation in ambient nutrient loads as a case scenario. (1) We analyzed bivalve foot tissue δ15N and δ13C from 22 stream reaches in the Piedmont region of North Carolina, USA to show that compositions varied substantially among locations. Site mean bivalve δ13C values correlated with site ambient particulate organic matter (POM) δ13C values, and site mean bivalve δ15N values correlated with site ambient water dissolved δ15N-NO3 values. (2) Similarity of results among sample types demonstrated that the minimally invasive hemolymph sample is a suitable substitute for foot tissue in δ15N analyses, and that small sample sizes generate means representative of a larger population. Both findings can help minimize the impact of sampling on imperiled freshwater mussel populations. (3) In a bivalve transplantation study we showed that hemolymph δ15N compositions responded to a shift in ambient dissolved δ15N-NO3, although slowly. The tissue turnover time for bivalve hemolymph was 113 days. We conclude that bivalves serve best as biomonitors of chronic, rather than acute, fluctuations in stream nutrient loads, and provide initial evidence of their suitability as time-integrated isotopic baselines for community studies.

AN  - 926251134
AB  - (2006b) evaluated a range of sublethal end points (molecular, cellular, physiological) in common coastal organisms (filter feeding, grazing, predatory) and habitat requirements (estuary, rocky shore) to support an evidence-based approach using easy-to-use, cost effective and environmentally valid biomarkers to assess the health of coastal ecosystems.  Fecal indicator organisms were influenced by salinity suggesting that fecal indicator organism concentrations were either diluted by marine water or salinity induced die-off was occurring.

T1  - Application of Risk Assessment and Decision Analysis to Aquatic Nuisance Species
AN  - 210706757
AB  - The spread of nonindigenous (nonnative) species introduced into the United States is a significant and growing national problem and results in lost agricultural productivity, increased health problems, native species extinctions, and expensive prevention and eradication efforts. Thousands of nonindigenous species have either become established or spread, and introduction of aquatic nuisance species (ANS) into freshwater lakes threaten aquatic biodiversity. Expanding global trade is likely to increase the number of species that are spread across the globe, so the need to develop an approach to predict potential ANS invasions is great. Risk assessments currently being used to assess ANS risk rely on qualitative or semiquantitative information and expert opinion; thus, such approaches lack transparency and repeatability. A more quantitative approach is needed to augment the qualitative approaches currently in use. A quantitative approach with the use of the traditional ecological risk assessment (traditional ERA) framework combined with decision analysis tools was developed for assessing ANS risks in which the causative ecological risk agent is an organism rather than a chemical. This paper presents a systematic risk assessment framework that includes structured decision analysis to help organize and analyze pertinent data, state assumptions, address uncertainties in estimating the probability of an undesired ANS introduction, or spread and integrate these outputs with stakeholder values. This paper also describes when and how decision analysis tools can be used in such assessments for ANS. This framework and methodology will enable risk managers to systematically evaluate and compare alternatives and actions supporting ANS risk management and thus credibly prioritize resources.

T1  - Low-Nitrate-Days (LND), a Potential Indicator of Cyanobacteria Blooms in a Eutrophic Hardwater Reservoir
AN  - 20366903; 9047001
AB  - When nitrate was low in a hypereutrophic, hardwater reservoir, cyanobacteria proliferated into blooms. Based on this observation an index was developed that relates an easily measurable variable, the period of Low-Nitrate-Days (LND), to the period when nuisance cyanobacteria (blue-greens) proliferate and "bloom". The bloom indicator LND (d times yr-1) was defined as the period of time during summer and early fall when nitrate concentration is below a lake-specific threshold. This concept was valuable in Fanshawe Lake, a southern Ontario reservoir of the Thames River in the Lake Erie catchment basin, where traditional bloom indicators are rare. A nitrate threshold of 1 to 2 mg times L-1 is supported by occasional observations of chlorophyll (Chl) concentration, blue-green biomass, visual inspection, and photographic documentation. Fanshawe Lake's water quality (phosphorus, Chl, and Secchi disk transparency) varied from summer to summer and LND ranged from 0 to 175 d times yr-1 with a long-term average of 62 d times yr-1 for 38 years. LND was positively and significantly correlated with average summer total phosphorus concentration (available for 8 years), but not Chl (n = 6) nor transparency (n = 11), possibly because of an invasion by the zebra mussel Dreissena. LND values agreed well with cyanobacteria biomass indicators predicted from other models. Significant relationships with 38 years of flows and the climatic index (winter North Atlantic Oscillation) reveal that during high-flow years estimated cyanobacteria blooms are infrequent, while during low-flow years bloom periods are extended and the water quality is poor. Investigations on other man-made lakes and river sections of the Thames River, and preliminary studies on natural lakes with differing trophic states show that LND may be a useful variable in all lakes and reservoirs where nutrient limitation switches from phosphorus to nitrogen during summer.

T1  - Interspecific Comparison of the Mechanical Properties of Mussel Byssus
AN  - 220982943; 17179385
AB  - Byssally tethered mussels are found in a variety of habitats, including rocky intertidal, salt marsh, subtidal, and hydrothermal vents. One key to the survival of mussels in these communities is a secure attachment, achieved by the production of byssal threads. Although many studies have detailed the unique biomechanical properties of byssal threads, only a few prevalent species have been examined. This study assesses the variation in the mechanical properties of byssus in a broad range of mussel species from diverse environments, including intertidul and subtidal Mytilus edulis, Modiolus modiolus, Geukensia demissa, Bathymodiolus thermophilus, and Dreissena polymorpha. A tensometer was used to measure quasi-static and dynamic mechanical properties of individual threads, and several aspects of morphology were quantified. The results indicate that thread mechanical properties vary among mussel species, and several novel properties were observed. For example, of the species examined, D. polymorpha threads were the strongest, stiffest, least resilient, and fastest to recover after partial deformation. Threads of M. modiolus were characterized by the presence of two distinct yield regions prior to tensile failure. This comparative study not only provides insight into the ecological limitations and evolution of mussels, but also suggests new models for the design of novel biomimetic polymers.

T1  - What's the (Critical Control) Point of HACCP: Minimizing the Spread of Aquatic Invasive Species
AN  - 20200932; 8380425
AB  - Prevention continues to prove the best defense against the mounting impacts of aquatic invasive species like zebra mussels and silver carp. The Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) process has been used for years to reduce the risk of food contamination, but its use to minimize the spread of invasive species is still evolving. HACCP provides for a step-by-step analysis of a particular operation to identify vulnerabilities for inadvertent transport of unwanted species, and then helps pinpoint the most effective opportunities for closing those pathways. But identifying critical control points and associated control methods during initial development of a HACCP plan isn't enough. The continuing flow of new invasive species into the region requires frequent updates to ensure that all relevant risks are addressed. Further, best management practices that result from HACCP only matter if they're implemented, and even then they don't always eliminate a particular risk. Therefore, a key but sometimes-neglected aspect of a HACCP plan is the associated corrective action that can be triggered when an invasive species control limit isn't met. A number of existing HACCP plans can help illustrate how to make this process successful. If developed properly and implemented effectively, HACCP can help fish culture facilities avoid costly operating restrictions and serious environmental impacts. More information and resources for HACCP plan development can be found at www.haccp-nrm.org.

T1  - Hydroinformatics techniques in eco-environmental modelling and management
AN  - 1943108473
AB  - The high complexity of aquatic ecosystems and the multiple processes involved, make the development of ecohydraulics and eco-environmental models a challenging subject. Conventionally, computer-based models use a mathematical formulation for the processes involved which are then solved by numerical methods. These models are often derived based on the assumption of spatial homogeneity and conservation principles of mass, momentum and energy. Development of these models often demands a clear understanding of the processes involved. However, the above assumptions are easily violated when spatial heterogeneity, individual species behaviour and local interactions play a significant role in the system dynamics. In particular for eco-environmental systems, knowledge on local interactions that determine the overall system behaviour is not always available. Although the rapid advances of data-driven techniques have recently made great contributions to water-environment related research, data on ecosystems are often quite limited, which restricts the application of data mining methods to eco-environmental system modelling. In addition, no modelling - also not black-box modelling - can be undertaken without having at least some understanding of the basic processes and mechanisms involved. It is always advisable to start exploring any dataset using conventional statistical techniques, as elaborated in this paper for a case study on Western Xiamen Bay, China. Neural network trimming was then used to establish the dominant factors; it was shown that a relatively simple ANN model was quite capable of capturing the essential features, provided the right input parameters are chosen. Examples of integrated approaches to ecohydraulics modelling coupling formulations with cellular automata and physical equations with fuzzy rules are presented for applications on eutrophication modelling of Taihu Lake in China, competitive growths and colonization of two underwater macrophytes in Lake Veluwe in The Netherlands, and forecasting of algal blooms in the Dutch coastal waters on the North Sea. A mussel dynamics model developed for the Upper Mississippi River in the USA demonstrates the feasibility of individual based modelling in ecosystem dynamics. Numerical models are quite capable of simulating the abiotic aquatic environment, including complicated fluid flow and transport mechanisms. However, when it comes to simulating the biotic and ecosystem dynamics, the interaction of individual species with their environment, as well as the interactions amongst species, has to be taken into account. The future of ecohydraulics and eco-environmental modelling thus seems to lie in the integration of different paradigms and techniques, which is the core content of the hydroinformatics discipline.

T1  - Responses of periphyton to artificial nutrient enrichment in freshwater kettle ponds of Cape Cod National Seashore
AN  - 821541874
AB  - Nutrient enrichment bioassays, in conjunction with sampling and analysis of surface water chemistry, were conducted in freshwater lakes (kettle ponds) of Cape Cod National Seashore (Massachusetts, USA) to ascertain the importance of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in regulating the growth of periphyton. Arrays of nutrient diffusing substrata (NDS) were suspended 0.5 m below the water surface in a total of 12 ponds in July and August 2005. Algal biomass developing on each NDS after ~3 weeks of exposure in each month was assessed by quantifying chlorophyll a + phaeophyton pigments. In both July and August, strong responses to N + P and N enrichments were observed in the majority of ponds, while P had no stimulatory effect. These responses correspond well with low atomic ratios (1–18) of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) to total phosphorus (TP) in ambient surface waters. The results suggest that conditions in the kettle ponds develop whereby nitrogen is the primary limiting nutrient to periphyton growth. While this may be a seasonal phenomenon, it has implications for nutrient management in individual ponds and within the larger watershed.

T1  - Ionic and Acid-Base Consequences of Exposure to Increased Salinity in the Zebra Mussel, Dreissena polymorpha
AN  - 220963993; 16946243
AB  - Dreissena polymorpha, an invasive freshwater bivalve, displays physiological characteristics that reflect its ancestry in brackish water, yet it has limited ability to withstand modest increases in salinity. We examined changes in hemolymph ion concentrations and acid-base variables in mussels transferred to and incubated in 10% artificial seawater (ASW) for 7 days and then returned to pondwater (PW) for a further 7 days. Hemolymph was sampled (10 animals per sample period) every 4 h for the first 24-h incubation and at 72 h and 168 h for both the transfer to 10% ASW and the transfer back to PW. The initial response to transfer to 10% ASW was a rapid attainment of an apparent isoosmotic steady state, with most hemolymph ion concentrations rising and attaining steady state within 12 h. Hemolymph magnesium rose more slowly, and hemolymph calcium declined despite an increase in its concentration in the bathing medium. Hemolymph pH rose significantly during the first 24 h, from 7.96 to 8.25, as a result of increases in bicarbonate; pH subsequently returned to normal through increases in PCO^sub 2^. When animals were returned to PW after 7 days' incubation in ASW, the response of the major hemolymph ions was largely the reverse of that effected by the transfer to ASW. Hemolymph pH was not altered significantly until after 72 h in PW, when declines in bicarbonate lowered the pH to 7.73. Strong ion difference (SID) was related significantly to hemolymph pH. Hemolymph calcium and magnesium showed a reciprocal relationship throughout both transfer and incubation. Solubility interactions between sulfate and calcium and magnesium may be important in determining calcium availability in solution. The Na/K ratio in hemolymph was maintained within relatively narrow bounds throughout the procedure and may contribute to the mussels' ability to volume-regulate during an osmotic challenge. Overall, the responses of D. polymorpha to modest changes in salinity were largely the result of passive processes. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Could Limnoperna fortunei be worse than Dreissena polymorpha? potential spread and ecosystem impacts
AN  - 20312064; 7159087
AB  - Although taxonomically unrelated, the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) and golden mussel (Limnoperna fortunei) have very similar life histories, suggesting that similar vectors are involved in their spread. Both are sessile, byssate bivalves with a planktonic larval stage and high reproductive capacity. Adults of both species attain extremely high densities physically changing the substrate, and because they are such effective suspension feeders they greatly enhance benthic-pelagic coupling and act as powerful ecosystem engineers. We compare environmental limits and ecological impacts of the well studied D. polymorpha with the lesser known L. fortunei to predict the potential spread and ecosystem impacts of the golden mussels. Limnoperna fortunei reaches population densities similar to or higher than D. polymorpha. It has comparable filtering rates and therefore may have similar or even stronger ecosystem impacts. In addition, L. fortunei has broader environmental tolerances than D. polymorpha, including higher water temperatures, lower pH levels, lower calcium content and water pollution. Therefore, L. fortunei may be much more successful than D. polymorpha in regions dominated by acidic, soft and contaminated waters. We predict that in the near future L. fortunei will colonize the southern and central parts of North America, Southern Europe, Northern Africa, and Australia, as well as expand its distribution in South America and Asia. Although to date D. polymorpha is considered the most aggressive freshwater invader, soon many waterbodies that are already affected by D. polymorpha may get another, even more aggressive invader.

T1  - Ionic and Acid-Base Consequences of Exposure to Increased Salinity in the Zebra Mussel, Dreissena polymorpha
AN  - 19352939; 7113543
AB  - Dreissena polymorpha, an invasive freshwater bivalve, displays physiological characteristics that reflect its ancestry in brackish water, yet it has limited ability to withstand modest increases in salinity. We examined changes in hemolymph ion concentrations and acid-base variables in mussels transferred to and incubated in 10% artificial seawater (ASW) for 7 days and then returned to pondwater (PW) for a further 7 days. Hemolymph was sampled (10 animals per sample period) every 4 h for the first 24-h incubation and at 72 h and 168 h for both the transfer to 10% ASW and the transfer back to PW. The initial response to transfer to 10% ASW was a rapid attainment of an apparent isoosmotic steady state, with most hemolymph ion concentrations rising and attaining steady state within 12 h. Hemolymph magnesium rose more slowly, and hemolymph calcium declined despite an increase in its concentration in the bathing medium. Hemolymph pH rose significantly during the first 24 h, from 7.96 to 8.25, as a result of increases in bicarbonate; pH subsequently returned to normal through increases in Pco sub(2). When animals were returned to PW after 7 days' incubation in ASW, the response of the major hemolymph ions was largely the reverse of that effected by the transfer to ASW. Hemolymph pH was not altered significantly until after 72 h in PW, when declines in bicarbonate lowered the pH to 7.73. Strong ion difference (SID) was related significantly to hemolymph pH. Hemolymph calcium and magnesium showed a reciprocal relationship throughout both transfer and incubation. Solubility interactions between sulfate and calcium and magnesium may be important in determining calcium availability in solution. The Na/K ratio in hemolymph was maintained within relatively narrow bounds throughout the procedure and may contribute to the mussels' ability to volume-regulate during an osmotic challenge. Overall, the responses of D. polymorpha to modest changes in salinity were largely the result of passive processes.

T1  - Hosts and parasites as aliens
AN  - 213507310; 16768855
AB  - Abstract

              
Over the past decades, various free-living animals (hosts) and their parasites have invaded recipient areas in which they had not previously occurred, thus gaining the status of aliens or exotics. In general this happened to a low extent for hundreds of years. With variable frequency, invasions have been followed by the dispersal and establishment of non-indigenous species, whether host or parasite. In the literature thus far, colonizations by both hosts and parasites have not been treated and reviewed together, although both are usually interwoven in various ways. As to those factors permitting invasive success and colonization strength, various hypotheses have been put forward depending on the scientific background of respective authors and on the conspicuousness of certain invasions. Researchers who have tried to analyse characteristic developmental patterns, the speed of dispersal or the degree of genetic divergence in populations of alien species have come to different conclusions. Among parasitologists, the applied aspects of parasite invasions, such as the negative effects on economically important hosts, have long been at the centre of interest. In this contribution, invasions by hosts as well as parasites are considered comparatively, revealing many similarities and a few differences. Two helminths, the liver fluke, Fasciola hepatica, of cattle and sheep and the swimbladder nematode, Anguillicola crassus, of eels are shown to be useful as model parasites for the study of animal invasions and environmental global change. Introductions of F. hepatica have been associated with imports of cattle or other grazing animals. In various target areas, susceptible lymnaeid snails serving as intermediate hosts were either naturally present and/or were introduced from the donor continent of the parasite (Europe) and/or from other regions which were not within the original range of the parasite, partly reflecting progressive stages of a global biota change. In several introduced areas, F. hepatica co-occurs with native or exotic populations of the congeneric F. gigantica, with thus far unknown implications. Over the fluke's extended range, in addition to domestic stock animals, wild native or naturalized mammals can also serve as final hosts. Indigenous and displaced populations of F. hepatica, however, have not yet been studied comparatively from an evolutionary perspective. A. crassus, from the Far East, has invaded three continents, without the previous naturalization of its natural host Anguilla japonica, by switching to the respective indigenous eel species. Local entomostrac crustaceans serve as susceptible intermediate hosts. The novel final hosts turned out to be naive in respect to the introduced nematode with far reaching consequences for the parasite's morphology (size), abundance and pathogenicity. Comparative infection experiments with Japanese and European eels yielded many differences in the hosts' immune defence, mirroring coevolution versus an abrupt host switch associated with the introduction of the helminth. In other associations of native hosts and invasive parasites, the elevated pathogenicity of the parasite seems to result from other deficiencies such as a lack of anti-parasitic behaviour of the naïve host compared to the donor host which displays distinct behavioural patterns, keeping the abundance of the parasite low. From the small amount of available literature, it can be concluded that the adaptation of certain populations of the novel host to the alien parasite takes several decades to a century or more. Summarizing all we know about hosts and parasites as aliens, tentative patterns and principles can be figured out, but individual case studies teach us that generalizations should be avoided.

T1  - Dispersion and Ecological Impact of the Invasive Freshwater Bivalve Limnoperna fortunei in the Rio de la Plata Watershed and Beyond
AN  - 19507746; 7200981
AB  - Limnoperna fortunei is a freshwater bivalve that invaded South America through Rio de la Plata estuary in 1989 and has since become a major macrofouling pest. Along the Parana-Paraguay waterway, which hosts intense boat traffic, L. fortunei has moved upstream at an average rate of of 250 km per year. In contrast, along the Uruguay river, where boat traffic is restricted to the lowermost 200 km section, upstream colonization is almost 10-times slower. This suggests that attachment to vessels is by far the most important dispersion mechanism. It is suggested that the Amazon, Orinoco and Magdalena basins are under high risk of invasion by this mussel, especially through their estuarine gateways. All South American basins host innumerable water bodies with favorable conditions for L. fortunei's colonization. Known ecological tolerance limits of the mussel also suggest that it may colonize much of the area from Central America to Canada, including waters that due to their low calcium contents, high temperature and pollution levels, and low oxygen are inadequate for the survival of Dreissena polymorpha. Despite it's remarkable geographic expansion and its extremely high population densities, L. fortunei's ecological effects have received very little attention so far. It is suggested that the 2.4-fold increase in Argentine landings of freshwater fish between 1992-1993 and 2000-2001 may be associated with the introduction of this prey species.

AB  - An increase of xenodiversity in plankton and benthos in the eastern Gulf of Finland was observed from 1998 to 2004. Nonindigenous species account for 4.8% of all species found and up to 96% of total bio one fourth ¬mass. Invasive benthic omnivores, the alien amphipods Gmelinoides fasciatus and Pontogammarus robustoides and the predaceous fish Perccottus glenii with their versatile diets strongly affect the community structure. Invasive sessile seston-feeders that directly (through grazing and water clearance) and indirectly (through recycling of nutrients) interact with other ecosystem components, are mainly represented by the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha, which affect the structure of benthic and planktonic communities as well as benthicpelagic coupling. The invasive predatory cladocerans Cercopagis pengoi and Evadne anonyx and larvae of D. polymorpha are only temporary components in the zooplankton, which is limiting their overall effect. Alien benthic bioturbators, the polychaetes Marenzelleria neglecta and the oligochaete Tuhifi'coides pseudogaster account for a high proportion of total abundance and biomass but their effects an native species need further research.

T1  - Biological invasions: the case of planorbid snails
AN  - 213503322; 16153319
AB  - Abstract

              
A large number of planorbid snails are now commonly transported by man mainly through the aquatic plant trade. However, only a restricted number of species establish viable populations in a new habitat and a more restricted number spread. Only five planorbid species can be ranked in this last category and can be considered as pests because of their role in the transmission of parasites to humans or domestic animals: Biomphalaria glabrata, B. straminea, B. tenagophila, B. pfeifferi and Indoplanorbis exustus. The neotropical B. glabrata, B. straminea and B. tenagophila have proven their capacity to invade another continent sometimes creating new transmission foci. The African B. pfeifferi and the Indian I. exustus have also expanded their distribution area with long-distance dispersal. Other planorbid species, i.e. Helisoma duryi, Amerianna carinata and Gyraulus spp. have been able to establish viable populations, but not to spread, presumably because they are limited to specific habitats or/and display poor competitive abilities.

T1  - The effects of predation and unionid burrowing on bivalve communities in a Laurentian Great Lake coastal wetland
AN  - 821258353
AB  - Unionid (Mollusca: Unionidae) densities have declined dramatically throughout the Laurentian Great Lakes after the introduction of dreissenid mussels (Mollusca: Dreissenidae). Recent surveys in some Great Lake coastal wetlands have found abundant unionid populations, but the factors that reduce zebra mussels on unionids in these habitats are not well understood. In 2001-2002, we tested effects of predation and unionid burrowing on corbiculids, sphaeriids and dreissenids in a Great Lake coastal wetland in western Lake Erie. In one experiment, we reduced access by molluscivores using exclosures with two mesh sizes (1.3 cm × 1.3 cm; 5 cm × 10 cm) and sampled bivalves after 15 months. Small mesh exclosures had higher numbers of dreissenids, Corbicula fluminea and sphaeriids (54.9, 3.8, 22.6 individuals/m^sup 2^, respectively) than large mesh exclosures (0.0, 1.13, 0.13 individuals/m^sup 2^, respectively) or open controls (0.3, 1.0, 0.1 individuals/m^sup 2^, respectively). Numbers of dreissenids on C. fluminea were higher in small mesh exclosures (3.8 dreissenids/Corbicula) than in large mesh exclosures (0.1 dreissenids/Corbicula) or cageless controls (0dreissenids/Corbicula). In a second experiment, we held two species of live unionids (Leptodea fragilis, Quadrula quadrula) and immobile Pyganodon grandis shells in exclosures (2.5 cm × 2.5 cm mesh) with either 5 cm, 10 cm, or 20 cm deep sediments and sampled bivalves after 2 months. There were fewer dreissenids on L. fragilis than P. grandis shells, but there was no difference in the number of dreissenids on Q. quadrula and P. grandis shells. Numbers of attached dreissenids were higher inside (189-494 dreissenids/unionid) than outside (8-11 dreissenids/unionid) exclosures, and densities of sphaeriid and C. fluminea clams were also higher inside (21.8, 4.7 individuals/m^sup 2^, respectively) than outside (0.4, 0.9 individuals/m^sup 2^, respectively) exclosures. Numbers of attached dreissenids were higher on unionids that could burrow below the sediments (20 cm depth) than unionids in shallow sediments (5 cm depth) for unexplained reasons. Our data suggest that molluscivores can play a pivotal role in limiting numbers of bivalves including dreissenids in coastal wetlands.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - MODELING LIGHT ATTENUATION, SECCHI DISK, AND EFFECTS OF TRIPTON IN SENACA RIVER, NEW YORK, USA1
AN  - 201344037
AB  - The development, testing, and application of a probabilistic model framework for the light attenuation coefficient for downwelling irradiance (K^sub d^) and Secchi disc transparency (SD) that resolves the effects of several light attenuating constituents, including phytoplankton and nonliving particles (tripton), is documented. The model is consistent with optical theory, partitioning the magnitudes of the light attenuating processes of absorption and scattering according to the contributions of attenuating constituents as simple summations. The probabilistic framework accommodates variations in the character and concentrations of these constituents and ambient conditions during measurements, and recognizes a linear relationship between the magnitudes of absorption and scattering by tripton. The model is tested and applied for a 21 km reach of the Seneca River, New York, that features optical gradients caused by an intervening hypereutrophic lake and dam, and a severe infestation of the exotic zebra mussel. The model is applied to resolve the roles of phytoplankton and tripton in regulating measured longitudinal patterns of SD along the study reach of the river and increases in SD since the zebra mussel invasion, and to predict decreases in K^sub d^ since the invasion.

T1  - Recent Changes and Patterns in the Water Chemistry of Lake Simcoe
AN  - 19822851; 6511956
AB  - After the Great Lakes, Lake Simcoe is the largest lake in southern Ontario. Located within a 1 hour drive of half the population of Ontario, there is currently major concern over the impact of rapid urbanization on the nutrient status of the lake. However, despite a more than doubling of the human population in the Lake Simcoe watershed over the past two decades, average total phosphorus (TP) levels were lower in 2000-2003 compared with 1980-1983 at six of eight lake stations, and declines were significant at the most nutrient-enriched near-shore sites located in Kempenfelt Bay (0.29 mu g/L/year) and Cook's Bay (0.31-0.41 mu g/L/year). Total P concentrations varied two-fold across the lake, and phytoplankton bio-volume followed a similar pattern, with greatest phytoplankton abundance occurring at high TP sites, particularly in Cook's Bay. Nevertheless, steep declines in bio-volume occurred at all sites beginning in the mid-1990s, and water clarity (Secchi disk depth) improved concurrently such that Secchi depths were 40-80% greater in 2000-2003 compared with 1980-1983. Zebra mussels, which became established in Lake Simcoe around 1995, likely contributed to decreased phytoplankton bio-volume and related improvements in water clarity, which began during the mid-1990s. Despite major reductions in phytoplankton bio-volume, average rates of dissolved oxygen (DO) depletion (18 m-bottom zone; normalized to 4 degree C) did not change substantially over time, and were similar in 2000-2003 (average 1.25 plus or minus 0.21 g O sub(2)/m super(3)/month) compared with 1980-1983 (average 1.26 plus or minus 0.19 g O sub(2)/m super(3)/month). In contrast, minimum, end-of-summer DO levels (18 m-bottom) increased slightly over the period of record. Although there has been some improvement in end-of-summer DO availability, DO concentrations continue to decline to levels that are limiting to many fish species (e.g., 3.8 mg O sub(2)/L in 2001) by the end of the summer stratified period.

T1  - Distribution and Abundance of Submerged Aquatic Vegetation and Trapa natans in the Hudson River Estuary*
AN  - 1672903398
AB  - Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) is widely recognized as an important habitat and indicator of water quality in large rivers and estuaries. A collaboration between scientists, estuarine managers, and environmental educators was initiated to map the SAV and the Eurasian water chestnut (Trapa natans) in the Hudson River estuary from Hastings-on-Hudson north to Troy, NY. These groups provided diverse scientific and estuarine management expertise to enable the first broad delimitation of SAV in the Hudson and sampling of beds to describe abundance, biomass, and species composition and to address management and education needs and opportunities. The areal extent of SAV based on a combination of 1995 and 1997 photographs in the study area was 1,802 hectares (4,453 acres), ∼6% of the river area and ∼18% of the shallows. Trapa natans covered 575 hectares (1,421 acres), 2% of the river area and 6% of the shallows. Results of this work have been integrated into the federal and state regulatory processes, local resource users, and local science education programs.

T1  - Impact of Oligotrophication, Temperature, and Water Levels on Walleye Habitat in the Bay of Quinte, Lake Ontario
AN  - 17706641; 6049280
AB  - Recent environmental changes in the Bay of Quinte, Lake Ontario, have coincided with a decline in the stocks of walleye Sander vitreus. Suitable habitat supply was estimated in three sections of the bay during the summers of 1972-2001 to assess its role in the decline. An empirical model was developed to predict suitable habitat area for walleyes based on their preferences for cool water and low light intensity. The results indicated that lack of suitable light limits walleye habitat in the bay. Walleye habitat in the shallow upper bay has decreased at the rate of 34 ha/year since the invasion of dreissenid mussels in 1994, while that in the middle and lower bays has remained abundant. Walleye stocks and suitable habitat in the upper bay have both declined since the early 1990s. However, this pattern has not been consistent through time and suggests that other factors have also affected the Bay of Quinte walleye population. The analyses developed here can be used as a tool to enhance the assessment of walleye habitat dynamics in the Bay of Quinte and allow us to examine the impact of oligotrophication on the habitat of an important recreational and commercial species.

T1  - WATER QUALITY IMPACTS AND INDICATORS OF METABOLIC ACTIVITY OF THE ZEBRA MUSSEL INVASION OF THE SENECA RIVER1
AN  - 201290348
AB  - The conspicuous shifts in summertime values of common measures of water qualify that have persisted for 10 years (1993 to 2002) in the Seneca River, New York, as a result of the zebra mussel invasion are documented. Resolution of patterns in time and space is supported by water quality monitoring that extends back to the late 1970s. Patterns are evaluated to describe the stability of impacts and quantify metabolic activity of the invader. The water quality impacts that have persisted unabated for 10 years since the invasion are the most severe documented for a river in North America. Changes in summer median conditions since the invasion include: (1) a 16-fold decrease in chlorophyll concentration (Chl), (2) a 2.5-fold increase in Secchi disc transparency, (3) a 17-fold increase in soluble reactive phosphorus concentration, (4) a 3.7-fold increase in total ammonia concentration, (5) a greater than 25 percent decrease in dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration, and (6) a decrease in pH of 0.55 units. The strength of these signatures has been driven by anthropogenic influences that include upstream nutrient loading and morphometric modifications of the river, and the functioning of Cross Lake, through which the river flows. This hypereutrophic lake sustains dense zebra mussel populations and related water quality impacts in the river downstream of the lake outflow by acting as a source of veligers and suitable food for this bivalve. Evidence is presented that levels of metabolic activity of the zebra mussel in this river have been resource limited, manifested through increased consumption of Chl and DO with increased delivery of these constituents in the lake's outflow.

T1  - Changes in the freshwater mussel (Bivalvia: Unionidae) fauna of the Bear Creek system of Northwest Alabama and Northeast Mississippi
AN  - 17292299; 5922055
AB  - Drastic reductions in diversity and abundance of mussel populations are documented in many systems. Bear Creek, located in northwest Alabama and northeast Mississippi, has seen changes to its fauna, possibly the result of impoundment, channelization, wastewater discharge, and sedimentation from such sources such as strip mining, agriculture, and silviculture. The most obvious influences have been impoundment of the lowermost 32 km of Bear Creek by Pickwick Reservoir of Tennessee River, the construction of four dams within the system, construction of a 29-km-long channel designed to limit flooding, and bank destabilization. Mussels are absent from much of the system and faunal composition has apparently been altered where mussels persist, based on comparison to limited previous studies. The most notable changes are the loss of Cumberlandian species diversity and the apparent increase in Ohioan species diversity. We sampled 40 stations in the Bear Creek system and report 32 mussel species live or fresh dead, including 3 Cumberlandian species, and 2 others weathered dead. Fourteen of these species were not reported in two earlier studies. During this study the most depauperate populations were upstream of Bear Creek km 41.0 and in tributaries. No mussels were collected immediately downstream of dams, and diversity gradually increased downstream from the lowermost main channel dam until 28 species occurred together in a free-flowing reach shortly before entering Pickwick Reservoir. One weathered dead zebra mussel, Dreisenna polymorpha, was also collected, representing a new tributary record. The population of Epioblasma brevidens in Bear Creek is the only population of that species known in the lower Tennessee River system, and the population of Lexingtonia dolabelloides, another new tributary record, is one of only two populations of that species known downstream of Paint Rock River.

T1  - Recent Increases in Lake Erie Plankton Biomass: Roles of External Phosphorus Loading and Dreissenid Mussels
AN  - 19946692; 6009281
AB  - Eutrophication in Lake Erie stimulated passage of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement (1972), reducing external phosphorus (P) loading and limiting excessive growth of plankton. As P-loading decreased to target levels in the mid-1980s, plankton populations declined. With the expansion of dreissenid mussels throughout Lake Erie in the early 1990s, phytoplankton population biomass was expected to decrease even further. We compared our recent plankton biomass data collected from May-October from 80 stations distributed in Lake Erie's three basins with previously published data to test whether plankton biomass decreased. Since a minimum in 1996 (0.74 mg/L), annual average phytoplankton biomass has increased to levels comparable to the late 1970s (4.1 mg/L in 1978 and 1998), whereas western basin zooplankton biomass has increased at a slower rate from 1996-2000 (0.10-0.14 mg/L). Recurrence of cyanobacterial blooms also suggests the lake has returned to more eutrophic conditions. Plankton biomass values from 1970 through 2001 are positively correlated with external P loading, except for zooplankton in the central basin and phytoplankton in the eastern basin. Recycling of P by dreissenids is partially responsible for the recent increases in algae, requiring additional non-point source P controls.

AN  - 1943311835
AB  - Continental aquatic systems, particularly rivers, are exposed to major changes due to human pressures. Some changes are voluntary such as flow regulation and the fragmentation of river courses, both due to damming, or the water consumption particularly in dry regions, which results in a partial to complete dry-up of some rivers (neo-arheism). Other changes result from indirect impacts of other human activities, and include: sediment unbalance of river systems, chemical contamination, acidification, eutrophication, thermal unbalance, radioactive contamination, microbial contamination, and aquatic species introduction/invasion. These changes can be regarded as syndromes which have now reached a global amplitude, even in less populated regions, as the result of damning, mining and of long-range atmospheric pollution, thus defining a new era, the Anthropocene, where continental aquatic systems are no longer controlled by earth systems processes but by human activities. Each region of the globe has developed specific patterns of syndromes trajectories that can be reconstructed from historical analysis and through environmental archives. These trajectories reveal multiple types of human responses to aquatic environmental issues (e.g. water quality), usually lasting 10 to 50 years for the successful ones. The reactions of the earth system to such major changes of fluxes (water, energy, nutrients, carbon, pollutants) via the continental waterscape, the land-ocean interactions, the water bodies-atmosphere interactions, are likely to take place over a longer time scale (100-1,000 years) yet are poorly addressed by scientists and not considered in Integrated Water Management, particularly as concerns the coastal zone.

T1  - A HISTOLOGICAL STUDY OF THE GAMETOGENIC CYCLE OF THE FRESHWATER MUSSEL DREISSENA POLYMORPHA (PALLAS, 1771) IN LOUGH DERG, IRELAND
AN  - 195518497
AB  - The gametogenic cycle of three size classes of the freshwater mussel Dreissena polymorpha was investigated by histological examination during 2000 and 2001 at Lough Derg. Co. Limerick, Ireland. This study provided a full staging method for the study of the reproductive cycle of the zebra mussel. Gonads and gamete development were observed in mussels in all months and in all sizes of mussel from 6.0 mm up to 25.9 mm long. Gonads (non ripe) were only observed in a small percentage (3.4%) of individuals smaller than 6.0 mm and only in females. Thus, mussels become sexually mature and are able to reproduce from at least 6.0 mm long and during their first year, characterizing a fast-growing population. It also appeared that only one period of successful reproduction existed, as only during 3 months of the year was there synchronicity in the gonadal development of males and females. Variations in the sex ratio were observed with a shift from female dominance in September 2000 to equal proportions of male and female in October 2001. Gamete development in males appeared to be more dependent on external factors, such as water temperature, illustrating a potentially important difference in the reproductive physiology of male and female zebra mussel.

T1  - Food quality controls reproduction of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha)
AN  - 734481004; 12721821
AB  - Species such as Dreissena polymorpha sometimes contribute substantially in the transfer of primary to secondary production. During the ontogenetic cycle, the reproductive investment of adult mussels is one of the main parameters that affect recruitment success. We studied how food quality and temperature affect the reproductive investment in term of egg mass of D. polymorpha in a lake by sampling mussels monthly from 4 m and 15 m depths. Temperature affected reproduction directly and also indirectly through the food. To assess whether temperature and/or food conditions led to the differences observed in mussels sampled from the two depths, mussels were reared in the laboratory under two different temperature regimes for 3 months, simulating the temperature of the lake at 4 m and 15 m depth. Possible effects of food quality were tested at each temperature using four diets differing in fatty acid composition. Temperature played an important role as a trigger for spawning, and the type of diet clearly affected the reproductive investment. When the heterokont chromophyte alga Nannochloropsis limnetica, which is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and long-chained PUFAs (>C18), was fed to mussels, an increased egg mass was obtained. This result was in contrast to that found when the green alga Scenedesmus obliquus and the cyanobacterium Aphanothece sp., both of which are deficient in long-chained PUFAs, were offered as food to the mussels. Such a PUFA-dependent food quality may affect reproduction in lakes. Food quality effects vary seasonally in a lake and may be most important in summer, when low-food-quality green algae and cyanobacteria are abundant. The low biochemical quality of these blooms may affect at least the later period of gametogenesis of D. polymorpha, which reproduces from June to August.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - FISH-COMMUNITY OBJECTIVES FOR LAKE SUPERIOR
AN  - 2102828079
AB  - The development of fish-community objectives for each lake is mandated by A Joint Joint Plan for Management of Great Lakes Fisheries (Great Lakes Fishery Commission 1997). That multiagency agreement also reflects a commitment to habitat protection and restoration through the following statement: The Parties must exercise their full authority and influence in every available arena to meet the ecological, chemical, and physical needs of desired fish communities. Accordingly, these fish-community objectives highlight habitat issues. The first objective summarizes the agencies' habitat concerns: Achieve no net loss of the productive capacity of habitat supporting Lake Superior fishes. Where feasible, restore habitats that have been degraded and have lost their capacity for fish production. Reduce contaminants so that all fish are safe to eat. Develop comprehensive and detailed inventories of habitats. The fish-community objectives were developed in conformity with twelve guiding principles that summarize the values and practical realities that constrain or guide fisheries management on Lake Superior. Additional objectives pertain to prey species, lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis), walleye (Stizostedion vitreum vitreum), lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens), brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), and trout (Salmonidae spp.), sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), nuisance species, and species diversity. Habitat issues impeding achievement of any objective are described. The most-pressing habitat concerns are in streams and embayments, and accordingly affect: * Tributary-spawning species, including brook trout, walleye, and lake sturgeon * Warm- or cool-water species, including yellow perch (Perca flavescens), northern pike (Esox lucius), and smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) Although numerous non-native species have invaded Lake Superior, with the effective control of sea lamprey, the offshore fish community has returned to a condition broadly similar to that which existed prior to the modern era. The agencies envision an offshore fish community dominated by lake trout as the top predator and requiring the continued control or eradication of sea lamprey.

T1  - EVALUATION OF RELOCATION OF UNIONID MUSSELS TO IN SITU REFUGIA
AN  - 195529576
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the recovery and survival of four species of unionid mussles [pimpleback, Quadrula pustulosa pustulosa (I. Lea, 1831); spike, Elliptio dilatata (Rafinesque, 1820); Higgins eye, Lampsilis higginsii (I. Lea, 1857); and pocketbook, Lampsilis cardium (Rafinesque, 1820)] that were experimentally relocated to in situ refugia in the St Croix River of Minnesota and Wisconsin, USA. In 1996, 150 mussels of each of the first three species (450 total) were relocated to three 5 x 5 m study grids (Site A), one near Lakeland, Minnesota, which served as a source-site control, and two in the experimental refuge 48 km upstream, near Franconia, Minnesota. In a second relocation in 1997, L. cardium was substituted for L. higginsii and 150 mussels of this and each of the other two species (450 total), were relocated to two study grids (Site B). The source site control was near Sunrise, Minnesota and the experimental refuge was 14 km downstream near Almelund, Minnesota. Mussel recovery, survival and substratum characteristics were evaluated annually at Site A for 2 years and for 3 years at Site B. Mean annual recovery of all three species ranged from 90 to 100% at Site A, and from 34 to 70% at site B. The mean annual survival of recaptured mussels ranged from 85 to 100% at Site A, and from 88 to 100% at Site B. The textural characteristics of the substratum differed significantly between the control and the two refuge locations at the beginning of the study, but did not differ from this initial status among subsequent years at Site A. At Site B, there was a significant shift in textural characteristics from large to smaller fractions over the four years. The relatively high survival of mussels during this study demonstrates the importance of proper handling and transport protocols when relocating mussels and the selection of suitable relocation habitat with stable substratum. When established correctly, in situ refugia may be a viable tool for preserving unionid mussels.

T1  - Toxicity of chlorine and three nonoxidizing molluscicides to the pest mussel Limnoperna fortunei
AN  - 221556992
AB  - The freshwater Asiatic mussel Limnoperna fortunei invaded the Parana-Uruguay river system in Argentina around 1990. Since then, the pest mussel has spread extensively and is now a major nuisance for many industrial and domiciliary water supply systems. This research exposed L. fortunei adults to chlorine and three nonoxidizing commercial molluscicides for varying amounts of time at concentrations between 0.25 and 100 mg/L at 15, 20, and 250C.

T1  - Importance of Lake Ontario Embayments and Nearshore Habitats as Nurseries for Larval Fishes with Emphasis on Alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus)
AN  - 18932832; 5621595
AB  - Productive embayments, areas morphometrically sheltered from open lake physical processes, were compared to less productive, exposed shorelines of the nearshore as nursery habitats for larval alewives (Alosa pseudoharengus), the principal forage fish in Lake Ontario. Species composition and densities of pelagic larval fishes were assessed with toward plankton nets at three embayments and adjacent nearshore habitats located along the New York shore, two sites in 1997 and a third site in 1998. Peak nearshore densities of larval alewives in 1997 and 1998 were compared to 1977 and 1978, a time period prior to major phosphorus reductions and the establishment of exotic dreissenid mussels in Lake Ontario. Seasonal changes in the pelagic larval fish assemblage were generally similar in the embayments; yellow perch (Perca flavescens) were prevalent in late-May shifting to co-occurrence of alewives and Lepomis spp. in June and July. At all nearshore sites, the larval fish assemblage throughout summer consisted mainly of alewives (> 65%). Densities of larval alewives peaked earlier in embayments but generally at lower densities than observed later in the nearshore. Because the amount of nearshore habitat greatly exceeds that of embayment habitat in Lake Ontario, nearshore waters served as the principal nurseries for larval alewives. However, densities of all larval fish species other than alewives (principally yellow perch and Lepomis spp.) were usually greater in embayments than the nearshore. Compared to three nearshore sites in 1977 and 1978, timing of peak densities of alewives in 1997 and 1998 were similar and temperature dependent; highest densities occurred in late July to early August after nearshore waters were greater than or equal to 18 degree C. Peak median nearshore alewife densities (larvae/100 m super(3)) in 1997 (47) and 1998 (60) were similar to those in 1977 (8 to 100) and 1978 (34 to 49). This similarity suggested a limited effect of lowered phosphorus and food web changes on peak larval alewife densities in Lake Ontario.

T1  - Energy Flow Through the Lake Erie Pelagic Food Web, 1992 - 1996
AN  - 1521403467; 5800309
AB  - A trophic transfer model that quantifies the patterns of energy flow through the Lake Erie ecosystem and identifies potential instabilities in the system is presented. The model comprises estimates of seasonal production and consumption of all major functional groups in the pelagic food web. Data were collected in a series of cruises that covered the whole lake and specific index stations during 1992-1996. Results indicate an enormous energy demand by dreissinid mussels that cannot be met by the production of prey groups represented in the model, and that predatory zooplankton, including the invader Bythotrephes, may consume as much herbivorous zooplankton as juvenile fish.

T1  - Relevance and Analysis of Traffic Related Platinum Group Metals (Pt, Pd, Rh) in the Aquatic Biosphere, with Emphasis on Palladium
AN  - 18622812; 5531830
AB  - Following the introduction of automobile catalysts in the middle of the Eighties in Germany there is an increasing emission of the platinum-group-metals (PGM) platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd) and rhodium (Rh). Still, it remains unclear if these metals are bioavailable for aquatic animals and to which extent they accumulate in the aquatic biosphere. Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) were maintained in water containing road dust at a concentration of 1 kg/101. Following an exposure period of 26 weeks, soft tissues of the mussels were analysed applying adsorptive cathodic stripping voltammetry (ACSV) for the determination of Pt and Rh and total-reflection X-ray fluorescence analysis after co-precipitation of Pd with mercury. This experiment revealed for the first time that all the three catalyst emitted metals were accumulated by mussels. The bioaccumulation increased in the following manner: Rh < Pt < Pd. Thus, the application of sentinel organisms in combination with modern trace analytical procedures in environmental impact studies does allow an assessment of the distribution and the degree of bioaccumulation of PGM in the environment, which is highly appreciated.

AN  - 208077477
AB  - Acute and chronic upper and lower thermal limits and freeze resistance are investigated in the nonindigenous brown mussel, Perna perna, from the Texas Gulf of Mexico coast in order to assess its potential distribution in North American coastal waters. This species' narrow incipient thermal limits, limited capacity for temperature acclimation and poor freeze resistance may account for its restriction to subtidal and lower eulittoral zones of cooler subtropical rocky shores.

T1  - SEASONAL METABOLISM AND BIOCHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF TWO UNIONID MUSSELS, ACTINONAIAS LIGAMENTINA AND AMBLEMA PLICATA
AN  - 195517684
AB  - We examined the seasonal patterns of physiology and biochemical composition  in two unionid bivalves, Actinonaias ligamentina (subfamily  Lampsilinae) and Amblema plicata (subfamily Ambleminae). We found  that (i) A. ligamentina and A. plicata displayed different  seasonal changes in physiology and biochemical composition, (ii) larval  brooding affected the physiology but not the biochemical composition of A.  ligamentina, and (iii) A. plicata had a greater carbohydrate  content and condition index than A. ligamentina. A. ligamentina and  A. plicata had different patterns of ammonia excretion rate, O:N  ratio, and clearance rate, while patterns of oxygen uptake rate were similar  between the two species. Overall, weight specific metabolic rates were higher  in A. ligamentina than in A. plicata. Both species had low  protein and high carbohydrate content in early summer. Brooding specimens of  A. ligamentina had lower oxygen uptake and ammonia excretion rates  and higher O:N ratios than non-brooding specimens. Differences in condition  and carbohydrate content between the two species could explain some of the  species-specific mortalities observed since the introduction of zebra  mussels.

T1  - Invasion Without a Bottleneck: Microsatellite Variation in Natural and Invasive Populations of the Brown Mussel Perna perna (L)
AN  - 1938949655
AB  - Population-level genetic diversity of the brown mussel Perna perna was investigated using nuclear microsatellite markers in 6 natural and 6 invasive populations. A total of 448 individuals from 12 populations spanning the natural and introduced ranges of the brown mussel were scored for 2 polymorphic microsatellite loci. Wright's hierarchical F statistics (F^sub ST^), Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, Nei's genetic distance, and other descriptive statistics were used to quantify geographic population subdivision, and to estimate the number of migrants per generation. F^sub ST^ values (0.007-0.042) revealed that genetic partitioning among populations was low. Microsatellite data revealed a slight difference in observed heterozygosity and no statistically significant differences in expected heterozygosity or allelic diversity between natural and introduced populations. Effective numbers of migrants (N^sub em^) per generation ranged from 6 to 35 individuals. The potential significance of an invasive species with high genetic variation in terms of the risk of establishment and conservation implications is discussed.

T1  - LIGHT, GRAVITY AND CONSPECIFICS AS CUES TO SITE SELECTION AND ATTACHMENT BEHAVIOUR OF JUVENILE AND ADULT DREISSENA POLYMORPHA PALLAS, 1771
AN  - 195527669
AB  - Dreissena polymorpha, the zebra mussel, is one of the most important components of the aquatic ecosystems it inhabits, due to high densities and filtration rates of this fouling organism. This laboratory study deals with several physical and biological factors influencing zebra mussel juveniles (<10 mm) and adults (>10 mm) site selection behaviour and their byssal attachment to substrate. Mussels preferred black substrate rather than white. This preference was found to be stronger in smaller individuals. Furthermore, all mussels, independently of their size, selected shadowed sites and avoided illuminated ones. Large mussels attached more often in darkness than in light, while for small specimens light conditions made no difference. Large mussels tended to attach to lower parts of vertical test-tubes, while the numbers of small specimens in both halves of the test-tubes were similar. If initial conditions, used by mussels to select their attachment site, were changed by turning the test-tubes upside down, small individuals detached and looked for a new site more frequently than large ones. Large mussels attached more often in higher densities of conspecifics, but physical contacts among conspecifics and their size composition seemed to have no impact on attachment. This study shows that many environmental stimuli influence locomotion and attachment of post-metamorphic zebra mussels. Therefore, the behaviour of this group may impact upon adult distribution observed in field. Preferences exhibited by mussels lead to the creation of dense aggregations in dark, deep places, providing protection against dessication, predators and excessive water flow.

T1  - Invasion of the non-indigenous nuisance mussel, Limnoperna fortunei, into water supply facilities in Japan
AN  - 1943098636
AB  - The aquatic nuisance mussel, Limnoperna fortunei, arrived in Japan before 1987 possibly with the Asian clam imported as food from mainland China. Now the mussel's distribution has spread to two river systems in central Japan. 
Water authorities reported several cases of damage caused by L. fortunei. Most cases of damage were caused by dead mussels clogging small diameter pipes for raw water sampling and monitoring and for cooling water. Clogging of cooling water pipes stopped raw water pumping to a water purification plant and caused the shutdown of a turbine dynamo-electric generator in a hydraulic power plant. The attachment of L. fortunei caused the malfunction of a water level gauge. There was a heavy accumulation of dead L. fortunei in slurry treatment facilities and rotten mussels developed an offensive odour. 
Although the screens and pipes of the raw water intake and transmission were inhabited by L. fortunei, problems relating to their decreased hydraulic capacity were not reported. This may have been due to the low reproduction rate and short lifespan of L. fortunei. There was one reproduction period each year, during May to September and their lifespan was two years at most. The growth rate could be about 15 mm yr−1 in shell length. Although chlorine in either free or combined form is effective for the control of L. fortunei larvae, so far water supply authorities have not considered prechlorination in the intake, mainly because prechlorination deactivates the biological nitrification along the pipelines.

T1  - Range expansion and potential dispersal mechanisms of the exotic cladoceran Daphnia lumholtzi
AN  - 220238652
AB  - . Recently the exotic cladoceran Daphnia lumholtzi has invaded freshwater systems throughout the southern and midwestern United States. We conducted regional surveys of eastern Kansas reservoirs to document the range expansion of D.lumholtzi. Daphnia lumholtzi was found in five of 35 reservoirs sampled in 1994, and 11 of the 35 reservoirs when re-sampled in 1997. In addition, we sampled 40 small ponds inaccessible to recreational boats, within the watershed of an invaded reservoir. We did not find D.lumholtzi in any of these ponds, suggesting that non-human dispersal mechanisms play an insignificant role in the range expansion of D.lumholtzi throughout the United States. Further experimentation, however, is needed to determine if the absence of D.lumholtzi from these small ponds is due to insufficient dispersal mechanisms or the inability of this invader to successfully colonize following arrival. Daphnia lumholtzi has broad limnological tolerances. However, invaded reservoirs tend to be larger in area, have higher Secchi disk depths, and lower total phosphorus, total nitrogen and chlorophyll a levels relative to non-invaded reservoirs. Analyses of pre-invasion zooplankton communities indicate that D.lumholtzi may be invading reservoirs in which native Daphnia species are rare. While the long-term effects of the invasion of D.lumholtzi are unknown, it has the potential to dominate late summer zooplankton communities in eastern Kansas reservoirs. Therefore, we need to continue to survey and monitor invaded reservoirs to document the range expansion of D.lumholtzi and determine the long-term implications of the introduction of this invader.

T1  - Evaluation of Lake Michigan Sediment For Causes of the Disappearance of Diporeia spp. in Southern Lake Michigan
AN  - 17770413; 4827297
AB  - The amphipod, Diporeia spp., the dominant benthic macroinvertebrate in the Great Lakes offshore waters, has exhibited a substantial decline in recent years. This decline occurred after the invasion and colonization of the lakes by the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha. It has been hypothesized that the decline is a direct result of the competition by the zebra mussel decreasing the amount of food available. This study examined the potential of other stressors, e.g., the presence of toxic materials, as the contributing or main cause of the decline. Bioassays were performed with sediments from stations currently devoid of Diporeia (St. Joseph, MI) and with those still having Diporeia populations. In 28-d mortality bioassays, no mortality was observed with any of the sediments tested. However, in avoidance/preference tests, sediments from St. Joseph, that are now devoid of Diporeia, were avoided compared to sediments from Saugatuck, Grand Haven, and Muskegon, which still have a population. This avoidance was not changed by the addition of either Spirulina Plus super( registered ) or Tetramin super( registered ) flakes to the sediment as a food source but was reversed by a fresh layer of the diatom, Fragillaria crotonensis, on the sediment. These studies suggest that despite the high carbon content of the St. Joseph sediment, the nutritional content of the sediment was limited.

T1  - Fouling mussels (Dreissena spp.) colonize soft sediments in Lake Erie and facilitate benthic invertebrates
AN  - 17648147; 4786508
AB  - Survey and transplant studies were conducted to determine whether colonization and residency on soft sediments by introduced, fouling mussels (Dreissena polymorpha and D. bugensis) were affected by physical disturbance, and whether Dreissena presence in turn influenced the diversity and population densities of other benthic invertebrates. Surveys revealed that colony density was typically higher at moderate depths than at shallower and greater ones. However, the largest, midsummer colonies and greatest coverage of sediments by mussels occurred at deeper sites. Disturbance of transplanted colonies varied by depth and colony size, with deeper and larger colonies experiencing the lowest destruction rates. Colony destruction rate was positively correlated with current velocity adjacent to the lakebed. Absence of mussel colonies at shallow sites was not determined by recruitment or substrate limitation, as recruit density was higher and sediment characteristics more suitable for postveliger settlement at shallow than at deeper sites. Rather, seasonal storms have much stronger effects in shallow than in deep water. Mussel residency on soft sediment has profound effects on invertebrate biodiversity. Invertebrate species (taxon) richness and total abundance were positively correlated with mussel colony area. Mussel-sediment habitat supported between 462 and 703% more taxa, and between 202 and 335% more individuals (exclusive of Dreissena) than adjacent soft-sediment lacking mussels. Results from this study illustrate that physical disturbance directly limits the distribution of mussels on soft sediments, and the diversity and abundance of other benthic invertebrates in consequence.

T1  - The effect of food availability on byssogenesis by the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha Pallas)
AN  - 195520038
AB  - The effect of varying algal availability on byssal thread production by  re-attaching zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) was quantified. The byssal  apparatus was severed and mussels allowed to re-attach to a hard substratum for a 21 day  period during which they were fed at algal concentrations of 0.0, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0 or 2.0 mg C l<-1<. Byssal thread production was quantified by counting the number of new  attachment plaques present each day. Results showed that starved mussels continued to partition  organic carbon towards thread production but the resultant byssal mass was compromised,  containing fewer threads than those produced by fed mussels. The daily average byssal thread  production by mussels fed at 2.0 mg C l<-1< was greater than that of starved  mussels and the final mean dry soft tissue weight higher. At algal C concentrations below  maintenance requirements byssal thread production was elevated compared to starved mussels,  but there was no concurrent increase in soft tissue. This suggests that below maintenance levels  assimilated carbon was solely partitioned towards byssus production and stored reserves may  have been utilized. The ratio of organic carbon contained in the byssus to that in the soft tissues  remained relatively constant across all feeding levels. This suggests that the carbon content of the  byssus is a constant function of that of the soft tissue mass. These results may explain seasonal  variation in attachment strength of numerous byssate species and seasonal vertical migrations by   D. polymorpha.

T1  - Faster, slower, or about the same? Long-term analysis of young-of-the-year yellow perch (Perca flavescens Mitchill) growth in Lake Erie
AN  - 19399397; 5317873
AB  - We sought to characterize patterns in growth of young-of-the-year (YOY) yellow perch (Perca flavescens Mitchill) based on large-scale ecosystem changes that have been occurring in Lake Erie during the past 20 years. Using trawl indices collected during this time period, we contrast the pattern of growth in YOY yellow perch from distinct basins of Lake Erie spanning a natural gradient of trophic state. Large scale ecosystem changes associated with phosphorus (P) abatement and the invasion by Dreissenid mussels occurred in the western basin prior to the initiation of the time series, but were delayed until recently in the eastern basin. Although inter-annual variation in growth was considerable, the lack of synchrony between basins suggests temperature or P levels was not exclusively limiting yellow perch growth. Bioenergetic analyses suggest YOY yellow perch growth may be additionally constrained by energy availability, with the largest effects evident in the less productive eastern basin. Our analyses quantify the relative impacts of climatic, community and ecosystem level effects on the growth of yellow perch as Lake Erie continues to respond to change. Elucidating biotic and abiotic processes that shape system production and energy available for growth in widespread species like yellow perch will provide greater heuristic power when managing complex and dynamic ecosystems.

T1  - Potential effects of the Round Goby (Neogobius melanostomus) on crayfish (Orconectes rusticus) in Lake Erie
AN  - 18265755; 5317794
AB  - We hypothesize that the introduction of the round goby in Lake Erie will result in a decline of crayfish densities, proposing two mechanisms: 1) direct predation of young-of-year (YOY) crayfish by round gobies and 2) indirectly via exclusion of adult crayfish from refugia by gobies resulting in increased risk of predation from other predators. In a laboratory experiment testing for the first mechanism, we allowed two size classes of gobies (80-100 mm and 120-140 mm) to prey on three sizes of YOY crayfish for 72 h in the presence of alternative prey (zebra mussels and associated macroinvertebrates). YOY crayfish were indeed selected as prey by gobies, although crayfish mortality in the small goby treatment declined from 65% to 13% as crayfish increased in size (4.9 mm to 12.7 mm mean carapace length). The refugia elimination hypothesis also was tested in the laboratory using pools with a limited number of refuges relative to densities of gobies and crayfish using a smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieui) predator. Gobies clearly evicted adult crayfish from refugia increasing crayfish exposure to smallmouth bass. By continuing to expand its range and abundance, the round goby likely will have strong negative effects on crayfish populations throughout Lake Erie.

T1  - Reproduction of river and lake populations of Hyridella depressa (Unionacea: Hyriidae) in New South Wales: implications for their conservation
AN  - 2663829077
AB  - The freshwater mussel Hyridella depressa is an important component of the macrobiota of freshwater systems of south-eastern Australia. This species has declined in river habitats but is abundant in impounded water storages. Reproduction of river and lake populations of H. depressa was investigated to document details of their gametogenic cycle and to determine when the females incubate embryos in their gill marsupia. Four populations in Lake Burragorang and two populations in the Hawkesbury-Nepean River were studied over two breeding seasons. Reproduction was documented by anatomical and histological examination of the gonads. The study sites differed in anthropogenic influence and trophic status and the influence of these factors on reproduction in H. depressa was assessed. A skewed sex ratio in favour of females was common in the populations and histology revealed that some of these females were microhermaphrodites. It appears that sexuality in H. depressa is labile with the potential for self-fertilisation by individuals that largely function as females. H. depressa is a long-term brooder with progeny present in the marsupia for up to eight months of the year from mid-winter to late summer. Across all sites brooding started in July or August and finished in January or February of the following year. In parallel with the prolonged spawning pattern, gametogenesis in H. depressa was continuous. At the eutrophic sites the gonads contained advanced gametes throughout the year. H. depressa at these sites had a high annual reproductive output with the females producing several clutches each year. In contrast, gametogenesis in mussels at the oligotrophic sites was more seasonal. At one of the oligotrophic sites reproductive failure was common and in 1996 most females failed to brood a single clutch. Implications of this research for conservation of H. depressa are discussed.

T1  - Population structure of an introduced species (Dreissena polymorpha) along a wave-swept disturbance gradient
AN  - 15786419; 3991684
AB  - The zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha was introduced to North America during the mid-1980s, and is now a dominant member of many benthic communities in the lower Great Lakes. In this study, I explored the abundance, biomass, size structure and settlement of Dreissena inhabiting rocks along a wave-swept disturbance gradient near Middle Sister Island in western Lake Erie. Ten rocks were collected from quadrats at six sites along each of three transect lines oriented perpendicular to shore. Occurrence, abundance and biomass of Dreissena on smaller, movable rocks were positively associated with rock distance from shore ( similar to lake depth) and with rock area; rocks at nearshore sites supported little, if any, Dreissena, whereas those at offshore sites were heavily colonized. Mussel size distributions also differed in relation to shore distance. Large mussels ( greater than or equal to 19 mm) were underrepresented or absent on rocks collected at nearshore sites, but were overrepresented at offshore locations ( greater than or equal to 37 m). Settlement of larval mussels on settling pads was positively correlated with distance offshore and with time of exposure, though settlement was substantial even at a nearshore (10 m) location. Area-adjusted mussel dry mass increased more rapidly with distance offshore on large than on small rocks. Large rocks also required more force to displace and were significantly less likely to be disturbed when transplanted at the study site. Results from this study indicate that occurrence, abundance and size structure of Dreissena in nearshore waters of Lake Erie correspond with the frequency of habitat disturbance, though other factors including food limitation and larval supply may also contribute to these patterns. These patterns complement studies that established the significance of physical disturbance in other aquatic systems.

T1  - FISH-COMMUNITY OBJECTIVES FOR LAKE MICHIGAN
AN  - 2102830442
AB  - The interagency management of fishery resources in the Great Lakes was formalized in the 1980s when A Joint Strategic Plan for Management of Great Lakes Fisheries (Joint Plan) (Great Lakes Fishery Commission 1980) was ratified by the heads of federal, state, provincial, and tribal resource agencies-the Committee of the Whole (COMW)--concerned with these water bodies. The Joint Plan implemented a framework for cooperative fishery management under the aegis of the Great Lakes Fisheries Commission (GLFC) by establishing procedures for achieving a consensus approach among fisheries-management agencies. Much of the responsibility for implementing a consensus approach to fishcommunity management was delegated to individual lake committees by the COMW. Lake committees are composed of a single representative from each management agency with jurisdiction on a Great Lake and were established in 1965 by the GFLC.

T1  - FISH-COMMUNITY OBJECTIVES FOR LAKE HURON
AN  - 2102831192
AB  - Strategic fishery-management plans brought forward in recent years have common themes: maintenance of stable fish stocks, provision of sustainable benefits consistent with societal needs, and emphasis on a healthy environment and natural processes. Management by consensus was identified in the Joint Plan as a necessary route for achieving this goal. Consistent with this approach, each lake committee for each Great Lake was directed to state mutually agreed-upon objectives for the fish-community structure for its lake. This statement of intent, the fish-community objectives for Lake Huron, represents a result of this process for the Lake Huron Committee. Fish-community objectives for Lake Huron rest on a set of ecological principles, tempered by social values, that give direction to management action and express management intent. The objectives reflect the understanding that natural systems are dynamic and provide some latitude in adjusting management approaches to different conditions that might arise.

T1  - WALLEYE-REHABILITATION GUIDELINES FOR THE GREAT LAKES AREA
AN  - 2024771282
AB  - INTRODUCTION The decline of the percid stocks in the Great Lakes in recent decades because of anthropogenic disturbances was summarized at the Percid International Symposium (PERCIS) (Colby and Rigmore 1977) by Schneider and Leach (1977).

Since PERCIS, many of these disturbances have been reduced.

The workshop focused on the rehabilitation of walleye stocks rather than rehabilitation or development of fisheries.

[...]technology or guidelines for developing new stocks (where none existed before), or for maintaining fisheries above the level that can be sustained by natural reproduction, were beyond the scope of this workshop.

[...]rehabilitation (by our definition) can only be achieved where the population was previously depressed to low abundance as a result of manmade disturbances (overexploitation, habitat degradation, andspecies introductions).

[...]Great Lakes fish communities and edaphic conditions have undergone extensive changes since the late 1940s (Schneider and Leach 1977).

T1  - The “Dreissena-Monitor” - First Results on the Application of this Biological Early Warning System in the Continuous Monitoring of Water Quality
AN  - 1943294841
AB  - The “Dreissena-Monitor” is a biological early warning system used in the continuous monitoring of water quality. The system is based on a computer assessment of valve movements in two groups of up to 42 zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha). Every 5 minutes, the percentage of open mussels and the average number of valve movements per mussel are calculated to describe the activity behaviour of the mussels. Rapid changes in both parameters normally reflect the onset of stress. More than 5½ years of experience in the continuous monitoring of water quality have revealed (1) that the “Dreissena-Monitor” is suited to large rivers like the Rhine as well as small rivers like the Erft or Ruhr, (2) that a lack of technical interruptions guarantees reliable, unattended operation, (3) that normally less than 3 hours of weekly maintenance are required, (4) that the validity check of the primary measurements was capable of identifying dead mussels and poorly aligned measurement components, (5) that the system can operate under unfavourable conditions (e.g. temperatures below 5° C), (6) that mortality rates were low and correlated positively with temperature, and (7) that the alarm thresholds provided a high degree of statistical security.

T1  - What's Next?: The Prediction and Management of Exotic Species in the Great Lakes
AN  - 2012103348
AB  - A workshop entitled What's Next? The Prediction and Management of Exotic Species in the Great Lakes was held in October 1991 to examine issues pertaining to exotic species and to recommend prevention and control strategies for future unplanned introductions into the Great Lakes. As long as the Great Lakes are inoculated with exotic species, new species will become established regardless of the state or condition of the ecosystem. As legislative and regulatory policies are designed to prevent new unplanned introductions, they must consider vector management and broaden in scope to include the North American continent. The workshop recommends that: 1) ballast water controls extend from the Great Lakes to the North American continent and include provisions to monitor both compliance to and effectiveness of the regulations; 2) a public education program be developed in the Great Lakes basin to alert the public of the dangers associated with releasing exotic species into non-native waters; 3) studies begin immediately to determine the extent of actual or potential release of exotic species associated with the aquaculture, bait fish, and pet industries and advisories should be issued against the use of organisms not present in the Great Lakes by these industries; 4) a Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Information Network (NASIN) be established to act as a clearing-house for information and coordinator of research and management within North America and a liaison with the regions that serve as the sources for North American introduced species.

T1  - Strategic Vision of the Great Lakes Fishery Commission for the Decade of the 1990s
AN  - 1935801842
AB  - The ecological and institutional complexity of managing the Great Lakes has caused the Great Lakes Fishery Commission to review current programs and to sharpen its focus on the future. This Strategic Vision was produced to communicate the results of this process. It provides an explicit statement of the focus, intent, and direction of Commission programs from 199 1 through the year 2000 and renews the Commission's conviction that an ecosystem approach is essential for successful management of the Great Lakes. A key part of this approach requires that existing relationships must be strengthened and new partnerships must be established between the Commission and its stakeholders - if the challenges of the future are to be surmounted. Changes in cultural values over the past 35 years have paralleled the rapid ecological changes within the Great Lakes. These societal changes shape the type of strategies and actions the Commission may consider to fulfill the general duties described in the Convention.

T1  - Depth distribution of colonization of artificial substrates in Hamilton Harbour and Lake Ontario.
AN  - 16655970; 3037140
AB  - In stratified lakes, the vertical distribution of Dreissena should be related to depth and temperature due to the requirement for moderately warm water for spawning. If mussel colonization is strongly reduced in deep cold water, problems with water intakes may be avoided. To test this hypothesis artificial substrates were placed in Hamilton Harbour and Lake Ontario. Clear results have been obtained from Hamilton Harbour where there is a summer oxygen depletion in the hypolimnion. Results from both locations related to temperature, oxygen, and turbidity profiles will be presented.

T1  - Genotype-dependent metabolism at the phosphoglucose isomerase locus at ambient and elevated temperatures.
AN  - 16614064; 3037028
AB  - Recent electrophoretic studies have shown that Dreissena populations in North America possess remarkably high levels of genetic variation at many enzyme loci. The locus coding for the glycolytic enzyme phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) is the most variable, with 7 alleles present in the Dreissena population at the study site in western Lake Erie. A series of experiments was performed during the summers of 1990 and 1991 to determine if metabolic rate was genotype-dependent at ambient and elevated temperature in Dreissena . Increasing water temperature has been hypothesized as a factor limiting southern expansion of Dreissena in North America. Results provide evidence that Dreissena possesses considerable genetic variation, and that variation at PGI can respond to selection via elevated temperature. This implies that zebra mussels have the ability to adapt to local temperature regimes, and that thermal tolerance measured on "northern" populations may not accurately predict ultimate thermal tolerances of "southern" populations of Dreissena .

T1  - THE STATE OF THE LAKE ONTARIO FISH COMMUNITY IN 1989
AN  - 2102833434
AB  - Kerr and LeTendre assess the state Lake Ontario fish community in 1989. The Lake Ontario fish community has undergone a number of profound changes from its original structure and composition. Lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens), Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), lake herring (Coregonus artedii), and deepwater ciscoes (Coregonus spp.) have become either depressed or extirpated. As a result of recent stocking programs and the introduction of several exotic species, the present Lake Ontario fish community includes top predators such as chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), coho salmon (O. kisutch), lake trout, brown trout (Salmo trutta), rainbow trout (O. mykiss), and walleye (Stizostedion vitreum vitreum).

T1  - STATUS OF WALLEYE IN THE GREAT LAKES: CASE STUDIES PREPARED FOR THE 1989 WORKSHOP
AN  - 2102828412
AB  - Native fish are comprised primarily of cold-water species: 1) lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), 2) lake herring, (Coregonus artedii), and 3) lake whitefish, (Coregonus clupeaformis).

Elevated mercury levels from walleye collected in 1984-85 prompted the issuance of a fish consumption advisory for Lake Superior and the St. Louis River.

Diversion of chloro-organics to WLSSD markedly improved the palatability of fish from the St. Louis River and increased angling pressure dramatically.

Since 1979, the western Lake Superior stock has been subjected to increasing angler pressure.

Possible explanations for differing estimates include: 1) interference from other Lake Superior walleye stocks, 2) adult walleye from the St. Louis River which did not spawn in 1981 and remained in Lake Superior, 3) immature walleye over 533 mm, 4) a progressive increase in tag loss during the recapture period, 5) nonreporting of tags from commercial nets, or a combination of all of the above (Schram et al.
