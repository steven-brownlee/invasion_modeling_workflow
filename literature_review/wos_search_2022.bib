Abstract = {Eurasian zebra and quagga mussels were likely introduced to the
   Laurentian Great Lakes via ballast water release in the 1980s, and their
   range has since expanded across the US, including some of their
   southernmost occurrences in Texas. Their spread into the state has
   resulted in a need to revise previous delimitations of suitable
   dreissenid habitat. We therefore assessed invasion risk in Texas by 1)
   predicting distribution of suitable habitat of zebra and quagga mussels
   using Maxent species distribution models based upon global occurrence
   and climate data; and 2) refining lake-specific predictions via
   collection and analysis of physicochemical data. Maxent models predicted
   a lack of suitable habitat for quagga mussels within Texas. However,
   models did predict the presence of suitable zebra mussel habitat, with
   hotspots of suitable habitat occurring along the Red and Sabine Rivers
   of north and east Texas, as well as patches of suitable habitat in
   central Texas between the Colorado and Brazos Rivers and extending
   inland along the Gulf Coast. Although predicted suitable habitat
   extended further west than in previous models. most of the Texas
   panhandle, west Texas extending toward El Paso, and the Rio Grande
   valley were predicted to provide poor zebra mussel habitat suitability.
   Collection of physicochemical data (i.e., dissolved oxygen, pH, specific
   conductance, and temperature on-site as well as laboratory analysis for
   Ca, N, and P) from zebra mussel-invaded lakes and a subset of uninvaded
   but high-risk lakes of North and Central Texas, did not refine model
   predictions because there was no apparent distinction between invaded
   and uninvaded lakes. Overall, we demonstrated that while quagga mussels
   do not appear to represent an invasive threat in Texas, abundant
   suitable habitat for continuing zebra mussel invasion exists within the
   state. The threat of continued expansion of this poster-child for
   negative invasive species impacts warrants further prevention efforts,
   management, and research.},

Title = {Rapid range expansion of the invasive quagga mussel in relation to zebra

Abstract = {Since its appearance in 2006 in a freshwater section of the Rhine-Meuse
   estuary (Hollandsch Diep, The Netherlands), the non-indigenous quagga
   mussel has displayed a rapid range expansion in Western Europe. However,
   an overview characterising the spread and impacts of the quagga mussel
   in this area is currently lacking. A literature study, supplemented with
   field data, was performed to gather all available data and information
   relating to quagga mussel dispersal. Dispersal characteristics were
   analysed for rate and direction and in relation to hydrological
   connectivity and dispersal vectors. To determine ranges of conditions
   suitable for quagga mussel colonisation, physico-chemical
   characteristics of their habitats were analysed. After its initial
   arrival in the freshwater section of the Rhine-Meuse estuary and River
   Danube, the quagga mussel demonstrated a rapid and continued range
   expansion in Western Europe. Quagga mussels have extended their
   non-native range to the network of major waterways in The Netherlands
   and in an upstream direction in the River Rhine (Germany), its
   tributaries (rivers Main and Moselle) and the River Meuse (Belgium and
   France). The calculated average quagga mussel dispersal rate in Europe
   was 120 km year(-1) (range 23-383 km year(-1)). Hydrological
   connectivity is important in determining the speed with which
   colonisation occurs. Dispersal to water bodies disconnected from the
   freshwater network requires the presence of a suitable vector e.g.
   pleasure boats transferred over land. Upstream dispersal is primarily
   human mediated through the attachment of mussels to watercraft. The
   relative abundance of quagga mussel to zebra mussel has greatly
   increased in a number of areas sampled in the major Dutch rivers and
   lakes and the rivers Main and Rhine and the Rhine-Danube Canal leading
   to a dominance shift from zebra mussels to quagga mussels. However,
   evidence for displacement of the zebra mussel is limited due to the lack
   of temporal trends relating to the overall density of zebra and quagga
   mussel.},

Title = {Non-native habitat as home for non-native species: comparison of
   communities associated with invasive tubeworm and native oyster reefs},
Journal = {AQUATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {2},
Number = {1},
Pages = {47-56},
Abstract = {Introduction vectors for marine non-native species, such as oyster
   culture and boat fouling, often select for organisms dependent on hard
   substrates during some or all life stages. In soft-sediment estuaries,
   hard substrate is a limited resource, which can increase with the
   introduction of hard habitat-creating non-native species. Positive
   interactions between non-native, habitat-creating species and non-native
   species utilizing such habitats could be a mechanism for enhanced
   invasion success. Most previous studies on aquatic invasive
   habitat-creating species have demonstrated positive responses in
   associated communities, but few have directly addressed responses of
   other non-native species. We explored the association of native and
   non-native species with invasive habitat-creating species by comparing
   communities associated with non-native, reef-building tubeworms
   Ficopomatus enigmaticus and native oysters Ostrea conchaphila in Elkhorn
   Slough, a central California estuary. Non-native habitat supported
   greater densities of associated organisms-primarily highly abundant
   non-native amphipods (e.g. Monocorophium insidiosum, Melita nitida),
   tanaid (Sinelebus sp.), and tube-dwelling polychaetes (Polydora spp.).
   Detritivores were the most common trophic group, making up
   disproportionately more of the community associated with F. enigmaticus
   than was the case in the O. conchaphila community. Analysis of
   similarity (ANOSIM) showed that native species' community structure
   varied significantly among sites, but not between biogenic habitats. In
   contrast, non-natives varied with biogenic habitat type, but not with
   site. Thus, reefs of the invasive tubeworm F. enigmaticus interact
   positively with other non-native species.},

Abstract = {The objective of the study was to define the primary environmental
   factors affecting the composition of the macrobenthic community in an
   abandoned open cast sulphur mine pit lake that had been filled with
   water from a nearby river. We investigated habitats at various depths
   and the macrobenthic communities; samples were collected by scuba
   divers. Although rush and submerged vegetation in the subsaline pit lake
   was abundant and provided potentially good habitat conditions for
   mayflies, caddisflies, coleopterans, or damselflies, the native insects
   were scarce. The taxa do not have many representatives in waters with
   elevated salinity, so those present in the Machow pit lake were mainly
   euryhaline species. Chironomids were the most abundant
   macroinvertebrates in shallower zones, whereas non-native zebra mussels
   were the quantitatively dominant taxon in deep-water zones. Moreover,
   these non-native mussels were the dominant biomass of invertebrates at
   all sites in all seasons. The current composition of the invertebrate
   assemblage was probably primarily determined by the salinated water,
   which limited the abundance of native species and gave non-native
   species an edge.},

Abstract = {Habitat suitability models developed for non-native, invasive species
   often implicitly assume that projected invasion risk equates to risk of
   impact. I aim to test to what extent this assumption is true by
   comparing commonly-used invasive plant distribution datasets to
   abundance records. I compared herbarium occurrence records (downloaded
   from an online database) and regional occurrence records (compiled from
   individual states) to abundance estimates collected from over 300
   invasive plant experts for 9 invasive species in the western U.S. I also
   created habitat suitability models (HSMs) using these datasets and
   compared the areas of predicted suitability. Sixty percent of the time,
   herbarium occurrences were located in regions where the species was rare
   enough to be undetected by experts, while only 26 \% coincided with
   locations identified as having high abundance. Regional occurrences were
   located in areas where the species was not detected 32 \% of the time,
   and on high abundance 42 \% of the time. HSMs based on herbarium records
   encompassed 89 \% of land area at risk of abundance, but overestimated
   the area of estimated risk (27-46 \% false positive rate). HSMs based on
   regional occurrences had a smaller false positive rate (22-31 \%), but
   encompassed only 67-68 \% of area suitable for abundance. Herbarium
   records are strongly skewed towards locations with low invasive plant
   abundance, leading to invasion risk models that vastly overestimate
   abundance risk. Models based on occurrence points should be interpreted
   as risk of establishment only, not risk of abundance or impact. If HSMs
   aim to be more management relevant, invasion risk models should include
   abundance as well as occurrence.},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {23},
Number = {5},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Invasive bivalves can cause widespread ecological damage, but
   eradication has proved difficult. Identifying the pathways of dispersal
   is crucial to implementing more effective biocontainment measures. We
   examined the distribution of the highly invasive zebra mussel (Dreissena
   polymorpha) in Great Britain through Species Distribution Modelling to
   determine the drivers of distribution and generated suitability maps to
   predict future dispersal. Distance to boat ramps was the most important
   predictor of zebra mussel establishment, accounting for 27\% of
   variation in occurrence. Probability of occurrence was highest within 3
   km upstream of boat ramps, probably due to boating activity and the
   impounded waters typically associated with boat ramps. Our results
   highlight the need for implementing stringent control measures around

Abstract = {Invasive zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) pose both a significant
   economic and environmental threat to aquatic systems yet there are
   currently no effective methods for achieving large-scale eradication. As
   a result, predicting and preventing their spread play a critical role in
   management efforts. Zebra mussels were first found in Texas in 2009 and,
   as of November 2019, have invaded 39 lakes across five river basins.
   Prior state-specific risk-assessments have been solely based on habitat
   suitability and have not considered dispersal potential. We developed a
   water body specific, constrained gravity model incorporating habitat
   suitability and dispersal potential to predict potential future invasion
   patterns. We examined the relative importance of habitat suitability,
   lake attractiveness, the relative risk of different boater types, and
   the impact of boater compliance with recommended prevention measures.
   Differences in lake attractiveness resulted in different boater
   dispersal patterns but the impact on projected lake invasions were
   reduced by variation in habitat suitability. The model projected zebra
   mussels to be mainly limited by habitat conditions in east Texas and by
   dispersal in west Texas. Most lakes in central Texas were projected to
   become invaded in the near future unless boater compliance with
   preventive management was high.},

Abstract = {New Zealand's native freshwater mussels (kakahi, kaeo) are considered to
   be in decline, yet the mechanisms driving this are unclear. The
   widespread establishment of highly efficient filter-feeding, non-native
   Daphnia in New Zealand lakes may have led to competition for algae with
   kakahi. We conducted a controlled laboratory experiment to determine
   whether differences exist in algal resources utilised by kakahi and
   North American Daphnia pulex. Echyridella menziesii (adults and
   juveniles) and D. pulex were exposed to mixed algal samples for three
   hours to determine whether similar algal resources were removed by the
   grazers. Relative to controls, both adult and juvenile E. menziesii
   removed a broad range of algal taxa including diatoms, green algae and
   filamentous species, ranging in size from 33.6 to 348.0 mu m. High
   densities of D. pulex were unable to cause depletion of these same algae
   species. Our results suggest niche overlap is limited between the two
   grazers; E. menziesii utilises larger particles than D. pulex.},

Abstract = {Twenty sites along the St. Lawrence River were sampled to determine if
   the distribution and abundance of invasive mussels (zebra mussel
   (Dreissena polymorpha) and quagga mussel (Dreissena bugensis)) are
   explained by physicochemical variables. Calcium concentration, substrate
   size, and depth independently explained significant proportions of
   variation in biomass for both species. Zebra mussel populations occurred
   at calcium levels as low as 8 mg Ca center dot L-1, but quagga mussels
   were absent below 12 mg Ca center dot L-1, suggesting that they have
   higher calcium requirements. Both species increased in biomass with
   increasing substrate size but displayed contrasting patterns with depth.
   Using combinations of these environmental variables, we developed
   stepwise multiple regression models to predict zebra mussel biomass and
   quagga mussel biomass. The zebra mussel model included calcium
   concentration, substrate size, and depth (r(2) = 0.36, P < 0.0001),
   while the quagga mussel model included only substrate size and depth
   (r(2) = 0.32, P < 0.0001). These results suggest that dreissenid mussel
   abundance (and correlated impacts) will vary predictably across
   environmental gradients, but the same predictive model will not be
   accurate for both species.},

Abstract = {Biological invasions and climate change are important drivers of
   biodiversity loss. In freshwater ecosystems, golden and zebra mussels
   are two highly aggressive invasive species that have caused ecological
   and economic damages in South and North America, respectively. Here, we
   used ecological niche models (ENMs) to investigate the invasive
   potential of golden and zebra mussels in present and future scenarios of
   global warming in the New World. We found two main patterns in the
   distribution of suitable areas for golden and zebra mussels. First, the
   distribution of potentially suitable areas, both in present and future
   scenarios, is different between mussel species: zebra mussel has areas
   that are more suitable in temperate regions, while suitable areas for
   golden mussel are concentrated in tropical and subtropical regions.
   Second, suitable habitats for golden mussel will increase more in future
   global warming scenarios compared to suitable habitats for zebra mussel.
   Indeed, there are experimental indications that zebra mussel has a lower
   tolerance to high temperatures compared to golden mussel, which is in
   agreement with our findings. We recommend that the future monitoring of
   both golden and zebra mussels in the New World should consider areas of
   highest thermic suitability for current and future scenarios.},

Title = {Recreational freshwater fishing drives non-native aquatic species
   richness patterns at a continental scale},
Journal = {DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {23},
Number = {6},
Pages = {692-702},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {AimMapping the geographic distribution of non-native aquatic species is
   a critically important precursor to understanding the anthropogenic and
   environmental factors that drive freshwater biological invasions. Such
   efforts are often limited to local scales and/or to single species, due
   to the challenges of data acquisition at larger scales. Here, we map the
   distribution of non-native freshwater species richness across the
   continental United States and investigate the role of human activity in
   driving macroscale patterns of aquatic invasion.
   LocationThe continental United States.
   MethodsWe assembled maps of non-native aquatic species richness by
   compiling occurrence data on exotic animal and plant species from
   publicly accessible databases. Using a dasymetric model of human
   population density and a spatially explicit model of recreational
   freshwater fishing demand, we analysed the effect of these metrics of
   human influence on the degree of invasion at the watershed scale, while
   controlling for spatial and sampling bias. We also assessed the effects
   that a temporal mismatch between occurrence data (collected since 1815)
   and cross-sectional predictors (developed using 2010 data) may have on
   model fit.
   ResultsNon-native aquatic species richness exhibits a highly patchy
   distribution, with hotspots in the Northeast, Great Lakes, Florida, and
   human population centres on the Pacific coast. These richness patterns
   are correlated with population density, but are much more strongly
   predicted by patterns of recreational fishing demand. These
   relationships are strengthened by temporal matching of datasets and are
   robust to corrections for sampling effort.
   Main conclusionsDistributions of aquatic non-native species across the
   continental US are better predicted by freshwater recreational fishing
   than by human population density. This suggests that observed patterns
   are driven by a mechanistic link between recreational activity and
   aquatic non-native species richness and are not merely the outcome of
   sampling bias associated with human population density.},

Abstract = {P> Invasive zebra (Dreissena polymorpha) and quagga mussels (Dreissena
   bugensis) have become widespread throughout the Great Lakes basin.
   However, some types of Great Lakes coastal wetlands may be unsuitable
   for Dreissena invasion.
   To test this observation, artificial substrata were placed in wetlands
   (with emergent vegetation) and in adjacent open water (without emergent
   vegetation) habitats in two types of Great Lakes coastal ecosystems:
   drowned river mouth (DRM) and coastal fringing systems. Wetlands in DRM
   systems generally have deep organic sediment and limited water movement,
   whereas coastal fringing wetlands generally have low to moderate amounts
   of organic sediment and intense wind and wave action.
   We did not find a significant difference in Dreissena colonisation
   between wetlands and adjacent open water habitat in fringing systems.
   However, Dreissena colonisation was significantly lower in DRM wetlands
   than in the adjacent open water. We also found significantly lower
   survival in DRM wetlands than adjacent open water habitats, whereas
   survival did not differ significantly in coastal fringing wetlands and
   the adjacent open water.
   Our results suggest that vulnerability to Dreissena invasion varied
   among wetland types with DRM wetlands being less suitable than fringing
   wetlands. We suggest that colonisation and survival of Dreissena is
   lower in wetlands with deep organic sediment and less turbulent water.},

Title = {Physiology in ecological niche modeling: using zebra mussel's upper
   thermal tolerance to refine model predictions through Bayesian analysis},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {43},
Number = {2},
Pages = {270-282},

Abstract = {Climate change and human-mediated dispersal are increasingly influencing
   species' geographic distributions. Ecological niche models (ENMs) are
   widely used in forecasting species' distributions, but are weak in
   extrapolation to novel environments because they rely on available
   distributional data and do not incorporate mechanistic information, such
   as species' physiological response to abiotic conditions. To improve
   accuracy of ENMs, we incorporated physiological knowledge through
   Bayesian analysis. In a case study of the zebra mussel Dreissena
   polymorpha, we used native and global occurrences to obtain native and
   global models representing narrower and broader understanding of zebra
   mussel' response to temperature. We also obtained thermal limit and
   survival information for zebra mussel from peer-reviewed literature and
   used the two types of information separately and jointly to calibrate
   native models. We showed that, compared to global models, native models
   predicted lower relative probability of presence along zebra mussel's
   upper thermal limit, suggesting the shortcoming of native models in
   predicting zebra mussel's response to warm temperature. We also found
   that native models showed improved prediction of relative probability of
   presence when thermal limit was used alone, and best approximated global
   models when both thermal limit and survival data were used. Our result
   suggests that integration of physiological knowledge enhances
   extrapolation of ENM in novel environments. Our modeling framework can
   be generalized for other species or other physiological limits and may
   incorporate evolutionary information (e.g. evolved thermal tolerance),
   thus has the potential to improve predictions of species' invasive
   potential and distributional response to climate change.},

Abstract = {Dreissena spp. are aggressive invaders of many waterbodies worldwide.
   However, the accurate assessment of their spatial distribution in large
   rivers is difficult using traditional sampling techniques such as Ponar
   grabs or SCUBA diving. The aim of this study was to use sonar
   technologies and underwater imagery (videos, still images) in tandem
   with traditional Ponar sampling to predict Dreissena presence, and
   produce a habitat suitability map to enhance our understanding of its
   spatial distribution in the lower Niagara River, New York, USA.
   Geo-referenced maps of environmental variables were generated using
   three sonar technologies: side scan sonar, multibeam sonar, and an
   Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler. Dreissena presence/absence was
   determined at 102 sites along a 10 km stretch using Ponar grabs
   supplemented by an underwater imagery. Substrate and near-bottom flow
   were the most important variables affecting Dreissena distribution.
   Habitats with coarse substrate and near-bottom flow of 0.6-0.80 m/s were
   predicted to be most often occupied. The habitat suitability model
   indicates that almost 90\% of the stream bed in the river can be
   considered highly- or moderately suitable habitat. Our results
   demonstrate that supplementing traditional sampling with sonar
   technologies and underwater imagery can greatly improve Dreissena
   distribution assessment at the ecosystem scale.},

Abstract = {Dreissena polymorpha (zebra mussel) is a freshwater bivalve mollusc and
   has been present for more than one decade in Spain. The zebra mussel
   causes serious ecological and socioeconomic impacts in areas where they
   settle. Our research aims to analyze its hydraulic habitat, developing
   physical models for this species, which indicates its preference and
   optimal microhabitat requirements. To get it, a survey was completed in
   a lotic reach in the lower Ebro River (Tarragona, Spain). Habitat
   suitability curves for the variables include water velocity, depth,
   Froude number, velocity/depth ratio, shear stress and shear stress ratio
   (RSS). In addition, interactive effects between hydraulic parameters on
   habitat selection and its use were studied and bivariate habitat models
   were developed. A close relationship was observed between the D.
   polymorpha presence and mean flow velocity combined with depth, Froude
   number and RSS. Suitable habitat requirements for Dreissena were
   detected in areas with stable river beds under high flows, and velocity
   below 1.2 m/s with a depth of less than 5 m under regular flows.
   Information about zebra mussel preferences may enhance the design of
   monitoring programmes and the integrated control management of this
   invasive mussel.},

Abstract = {Despite increasing recognition of the importance of invertebrates, and
   specifically crayfish, to nearshore food webs in the Laurentian Great
   Lakes, past and present ecological studies in the Great Lakes have
   predominantly focused on fishes. Using data from many sources, we
   provide a summary of crayfish diversity and distribution throughout the
   Great Lakes from 1882 to 2008 for 1456 locations where crayfish have
   been surveyed. Sampling effort was greatest in Lake Michigan, followed
   by lakes Huron, Erie, Superior, and Ontario. A total of 13 crayfish
   species occur in the lakes, with Lake Erie having the greatest diversity
   (n = 11) and Lake Superior having the least (n = 5). Five crayfish
   species are non-native to one or more lakes. Because Orconectes rusticus
   was the most widely distributed non-native species and is associated
   with known negative impacts, we assessed its spread throughout the Great
   Lakes. Although O. rusticus has been found for over 100 years in Lake
   Erie, its spread there has been relatively slow compared to that in
   lakes Michigan and Huron, where it has spread most rapidly since the
   1990s and 2000, respectively. O. rusticus has been found in both lakes
   Superior and Ontario for 22 and 37 years, respectively, and has expanded
   little in either lake. Our broad spatial and temporal assessment of
   crayfish diversity and distribution provides a baseline for future
   nearshore ecological studies, and for future management efforts to
   restore native crayfish and limit non-native introductions and their
   impact on food web interactions. (C) 2014 International Association for

Journal = {ANNALS OF THE MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {90},
Number = {1},
Pages = {67-76},
Abstract = {Over the past decade, mounting evidence has shown the pervasive and
   escalating harmful impacts of invasive alien species on native species
   and ecosystems. Thousands of non-native species are established in the
   United States and many more worldwide. Few areas appear immune to
   invasions, some of which unfold over decades to centuries as species'
   ranges slowly expand across the landscape. A plethora of ecological
   effects have been attributed to invasive species, and other global
   change processes and widespread habitat destruction will likely multiply
   these effects. Many conservationists now consider invasive species among
   the top threats to biological diversity and are grappling with
   identifying pragmatic, effective solutions. They know that the future
   will involve mixed assemblages of native and non-native species and have
   important questions about which invasive species to tackle and which
   ones to ignore, and even whether to deliberately introduce certain
   species for restoration. Addressing these issues will push hard against
   the limits of today's ecological knowledge and our ability to predict
   the long-term ecological consequences of such decisions. Better
   envisioning the conservation goals, though, could help to guide the
   science.},

Title = {Current velocity shapes co-existence patterns among invasive
   Dikerogammarus species},
Journal = {FRESHWATER BIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {62},
Number = {2},
Pages = {317-328},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Facilitative interactions among co-evolved representatives of the
   endemic Ponto-Caspian fauna are regarded as a major factor of their
   invasion success. Nevertheless, the most renowned examples represent
   interactions between different trophic levels or functional groups,
   while ecologically similar species can be expected to show
   competition-based niche partitioning. Here, we test for differences in
   the realized niche of three invasive Dikerogammarus species (Crustacea:
   Gammaridae) in their co-occurring range. We sampled multiple habitats
   within sites distributed along the River Danube to test whether some
   environmental variables could reveal spatial niche differentiation among
   the three species of Dikerogammarus, and if so, to test a predictive
   model outside the zone of co-occurrence. Spatial niche differentiation
   was present among the species, primarily determined by current velocity
   (and associated substrate preference), likely reflecting a stress
   tolerance-competitive ability trade-off. Suspended matter concentration
   was also relevant, suggesting food resources (through filter feeding)
   might represent another important niche axis, somewhat loosening the
   terms of co-existence between D.haemobaphes and the other two species.
   Environmental variables could effectively explain the absence of
   D.bispinosus in the Lower Danube, implying that the co-existence of the
   three species is possible only along a sufficiently wide current
   velocity gradient, and the observed turnovers are the result of niche
   expansion in the absence of the stronger competitor. Hence, differences
   in invasion success may be attributed to a stress tolerance-competitive
   ability trade-off. Our results suggest the advantage of D.villosus is
   attributable to its competitive dominance, allowing it to monopolize
   lentic and/or structured habitats, which represents a fortunate
   pre-adaptation to anthropogenic alterations of aquatic ecosystems. The
   presence of D.villosus does not greatly affect the expansion of
   D.haemobaphes; however, the exclusion of D.bispinosus from lentic
   habitats by D.villosus probably strongly limits its potential to spread
   by active dispersal.},

Title = {Improving Environmental DNA Sensitivity for Dreissenid Mussels by
   Targeting Tandem Repeat Regions of the Mitochondrial Genome},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The recent genetic revolution through the analysis of aquatic
   environmental DNA (eDNA) has become a powerful tool for improving the
   detection of rare and/or invasive species. For the majority of eDNA
   studies, genetic assays are designed to target mitochondrial genes
   commonly referred to as ``barcode{''} regions. However, unlike the
   typical structure of an animal mitochondrial genome, those for the
   invasive zebra and quagga mussels are greatly expanded with large
   extended tandem repeat regions. These sections of repeated DNA can
   appear hundreds of times within the genome compared to a single copy for
   the mitochondrial barcode genes. This higher number of target copies per
   mitochondrial genome presents an opportunity to increase eDNA assay
   sensitivity for these species. Therefore, we designed and evaluated new
   eDNA assays to target the extended repeat sections for both zebra and
   quagga mussels. These assays lower the limit of detection of genomic DNA
   by 100-fold for zebra mussels and 10-fold for quagga mussels.
   Additionally, these newly developed assays provided longer durations of
   detection during degradation mesocosm experiments and greater
   sensitivity for eDNA detection from water samples collected across
   western Lake Erie compared to standard assays targeting mitochondrial
   genes. This work illustrates how understanding the complete genomic
   structure of an organism can improve eDNA analysis.},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic stressors that affect ecological processes in the
   Laurentian Great Lakes can impact their susceptibility to bioinvasions.
   BigheadHypophthalmichthys nobilisand Silver CarpH. molitrix,
   collectively `bigheaded carps' (BHC), are planktivorous fishes
   threatening to invade Lake Michigan. While previous studies indicate the
   lake contains habitat suitable for BHC growth, there is a need to
   understand how anthropogenic-driven changes to the abiotic and biotic
   environment could alter its vulnerability to BHC. We applied a spatially
   explicit model of BHC growth rate potential (GRP; g g(-1)d(-1)) to nine
   biophysical model scenarios to evaluate changes in habitat suitability
   in Lake Michigan. Scenarios differed in meteorology (cool, reference,
   warm), annual tributary phosphorus loads (0, 3300, and 5600 MTA), and
   the presence/absence of invasive dreissenid mussels. Mussel effects on
   BHC GRP relied on their contact with the surface mixed layer (SML), the
   depth of which was affected by meteorology. The warm year advanced the
   expansion of Bighead Carp habitat by increasing temperature-dependent
   foraging rates and lessening the time of competitive interaction with
   mussels due to earlier stratification separating mussels from the SML.
   Phosphorus loads were the most influential driver of the lake's
   suitability. Compared to present conditions, we estimate BHC could have
   grown an additional 8-40\% annually in the 1980s when mussels were not
   in the lake and phosphorus loads were higher. Our study demonstrates how
   climate change and nutrient enrichment can increase Lake Michigan's
   vulnerability to BHC by affecting thermal regime and productivity,
   thereby limiting negative effects of dreissenid mussels on BHC growth.},

Title = {Invasion ratcheting in the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) and the
   ability of native and invaded ranges to predict its global distribution},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY},

Volume = {40},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {AimIn this study, we investigate changes in the environmental niche of
   an important pest species, the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha),
   across its world-wide distribution. The ability of models based on the
   native (Ponto-Caspian) and invaded (Western European and North American)
   ranges to accurately model the potential distribution of zebra mussel
   elsewhere was also investigated.
   LocationEurope and North America.
   MethodsA comprehensive cross-continental occurrence database of the
   zebra mussel was used to explore the species' native and invaded ranges
   using univariate and multivariate analyses. In addition, ecological
   niche models (ENMs, employing MaxEnt) were used to investigate the
   ability of the native and invaded ranges to describe the species'
   distribution elsewhere.
   ResultsWe found the zebra mussel to occupy different, but partly
   overlapping, environmental niches in the native Ponto-Caspian region and
   invaded European and North American regions. Accordingly, the ENMs
   calibrated with the native range accurately predicted regions of early
   colonization in Europe and North America, but not the subsequent
   expansion. ENMs calibrated with data from the European range failed to
   describe the invaded range in North America, and vice versa. Climate
   suitability curves further confirmed a progressive spatio-temporal
   stretching of the climatic tolerance of the zebra mussel.
   Main conclusionsThis study provides novel evidence of multiple episodes
   of niche expansion in a notorious invasive species, and supports the use
   of partial ranges to better understand the species' spatio-temporal
   history of invasion. Separately, the native and invaded ranges provided
   important information regarding the species' environmental tolerance and
   the regions that are most suitable for first colonization, as well as
   identifying regions at risk in the case of a possible reintroduction.
   Collectively, the differences between the three ecological niche
   projections of the zebra mussel demonstrate that niche expansion of an
   invasive species within a new geographical region promotes the
   organism's further invasion in space and time, a process known as
   invasion ratcheting.},

Title = {Lake Champlain offshore benthic invertebrate community before and after

Volume = {44},

Abstract = {Benthic invertebrates are important bio-indicators of water quality and
   play a significant role in aquatic systems. Lake Champlain has limited
   benthic invertebrate data which hinders development of food web models,
   assessment of invasive species impacts, and evaluation of management
   actions. In June 2016, we assessed benthic invertebrates along three
   transects in the main basin of Lake Champlain ranging from 5 to 100 m,
   and then compared results to densities from a limited survey in 1991
   prior to the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) invasion. In 2016,
   total biomass and density were 1-2 orders of magnitude greater at 5 m
   than at 20-100 m. Zebra mussels, chironomids, oligochaetes, and
   gastropods were dominant at 5 m, and oligochaetes and sphaeriids were
   dominant at 20-100 m. Total density at the 5-m site was 94\% lower in
   2016 compared to 1991, but similar at the 100-m site. Diporeia, while
   abundant in many freshwater bodies, is historically rare in Lake
   Champlain and was not detected in our sampling. Because Lake Champlain
   benthic invertebrate densities are low and display dissimilar
   distributions to the Great Lakes, we hypothesize the offshore fish
   community is likely much more reliant on pelagic rather than benthic
   production. Although the current composition and biomass suggest the
   benthic community in Lake Champlain may not be greatly impacted by an
   invasion of quagga mussel (D. rostriformis bugensis), the potential for
   quaggas to re-route energy from pelagic to benthic habitats, as it has
   in the Great Lakes, could limit the Lake Champlain offshore fish
   community. (C) 2018 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

Title = {Successful survival, growth, and reproductive potential of quagga
   mussels in low calcium lake water: is there uncertainty of establishment
   risk?},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {3},
Month = {NOV 3},
Abstract = {The risk of quagga mussel (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis Andrusov
   1897) establishment into water-bodies of the western US has expanded the
   geographic concern regarding the ecological and economic impacts this
   species will have in aquatic ecosystems. Thresholds based on calcium
   concentrations, an element critical for mussel growth and physiology,
   have been used as a primary predictor of quagga mussel establishment
   success to aid management decisions. We evaluated the invasion potential
   of quagga mussels in low calcium waters using laboratory experiments to
   compare the survival, growth and reproductive potential of adult mussels
   held for 90 days at low (9 and 12 ppm), moderate (15 to 32 ppm) and high
   (72 ppm) calcium water concentrations. In conjunction with adult
   experiments, veliger stage survival, growth and settlement were
   evaluated under similar low, moderate, and high calcium water
   treatments. Adult mussels survived, grew and showed reproductive
   potential in low calcium water (12 ppm). Veligers were also able to
   survive, grow and settle in low calcium water. Higher levels of natural
   seston biomass appeared to improve adult mussel life history performance
   in low calcium water. Survival curve analysis predicted that 99\% adult
   mortality could occur in < 170 days at 9 ppm and 12 ppm, however water
   with > 15 ppm could have adults surviving more than a year. The results
   from these bioassays provide further evidence that quagga mussels have
   higher risk of establishment in low calcium lakes if habitats exist that
   have slightly elevated calcium. These results should help emphasize the
   vulnerability of water-body in the 12 to 15 ppm calcium range that could
   potentially be at risk of establishing sustainable quagga mussel
   populations. Furthermore, these results provide insights into the
   uncertainty of using a single parameter in assigning establishment risk
   given the complexity of variables in specific water-bodies that
   influence life history performance of introduced species.},

Abstract = {Lake stratification produces sharp gradients in temperature and pelagic
   resources which have cascading effects on the traits of aquatic
   populations, including invasive species and their ecosystem impacts. We
   study the consequences of such common environmental gradients on the
   demography of quagga mussels, one of the world's most aggressive
   invasive species. Coupling a series of in situ experiments with a
   biophysical model of the pelagic community, we quantify mussel growth
   and recruitment in littoral vs. profundal benthic habitats of eastern
   Lake Erie. We found that both severe food depletion and cold
   temperatures in the hypolimnion during summer stratification cause
   mussels to grow twice as slowly and currently inhibit recruitment in
   profundal compared to littoral habitats. Together with the high biomass
   and large mean mussel size found in long-term monitoring surveys in the
   profundal habitats, our results imply that mussels successfully
   colonizing profundal habitats have relatively long lifespans with low
   growth rates, and therefore lower productivity, compared to mussels in
   shallow areas. Consequently, the bulk of dreissenid biomass in Lake Erie
   and other Great Lakes found in the vast but resource-poor profundal
   habitats may have very limited impacts on epilimnetic communities
   compared to mussels in littoral areas. By contrast, mussels in profundal
   habitats strongly reduce food availability to hypolimnetic communities
   throughout the year. Thus, our results explain how the ecosystem impacts
   of sessile freshwater invaders are likely to vary among habitats and
   lakes depending on the relative size of profundal populations and the
   extent of stratification.},

Title = {Potential effects of invasive Dreissenid mussels on a pelagic freshwater
   ecosystem: using an ecosystem model to simulate mussel invasion in a

Journal = {AQUATIC INVASIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Dreissenid (zebra and quagga) mussels are spreading across North America
   and having an impact on freshwater ecosystems, through bottom-up
   impacts. Lakes in British Columbia are known to be at risk for mussel
   invasion due to favourable water chemistry and significant cross-border
   boat movements. This project uses Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) to model a
   hypothetical mussel invasion into Shuswap Lake: one of the most popular
   lakes for recreation and one of the most productive sockeye lakes in the
   province. A model of the ecosystem was fit to available data and then
   projected forward to examine the effects from three different scenarios:
   no invasion, a base mussel invasion scenario resulting in a carrying
   capacity of 5 g.m(-2) and 15 g.m(-2) of zebra and quagga mussels,
   respectively, and a high density invasion scenario resulting in a
   combined carrying capacity of 40 g.m(-2) of Dreissenid mussels. The
   greatest ecosystem impacts resulted in declines in large piscivorous
   rainbow trout and lake trout, followed by non-anadromous kokanee salmon,
   with little effect observed on anadromous sockeye salmon. Two mechanisms
   limit the predicted impact of mussels in the study system: (1) paucity
   of shallow water habitat, limiting the scope for invasion; and (2)
   movements by fish in and out of the system. This second mechanism
   includes some resident species that rear for up to three years upstream
   of the lake, as well as anadromous species, which spend most of their
   life in the marine environment. While most of the effects are observed
   on recreationally important species, there is also the possibility of
   mussels spreading from this system into others within the same
   watershed, reiterating the importance of preventing the invasion and
   spread of Dreissenid mussels.},

Title = {Physiological limits in an ecological niche modeling framework: A case
   study of water temperature and salinity constraints of freshwater
   bivalves invasive in USA},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {346},
Pages = {48-57},
Month = {FEB 24},
Abstract = {Ecological niche modeling has emerged as a notable tool in invasive
   species risk assessment. However, the advances of the ecological niche
   theory, the basis of ecological niche modeling, are not matched by
   availability of detailed biological data. Thus, we proposed a conceptual
   framework to refine the boundaries of ecological niche, differentiating
   the species' existence status (survival, growth, and reproduction) based
   on physiological limits of major life history characteristics. We
   discussed differences between the classic and the proposed frameworks
   and emphasized the importance of the time axis in understanding species'
   existence status. We exemplified the implementation potential of this
   framework by reviewing published studies of physiological limits
   (temperature and salinity) for survival, growth, and reproduction of
   invasive freshwater bivalves in USA. We found considerable amount of
   physiological information through the literature review, though there is
   a research bias toward more influential invasive species (vs. less
   influential invasive species), temperature tolerance (vs. salinity
   tolerance), and survival limits (vs. growth and reproduction limits);
   filling the knowledge gaps will strengthen the potential of the proposed
   framework. Our framework addresses the lack of long-term field data, but
   is limited in that one can only identify unsuitable instead of suitable
   conditions for species, given incomplete understanding of species'
   physiological tolerance. Future studies may consider developing new
   algorithms that utilize physiological limits as priors in a Bayesian
   approach. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Inter-basin water transfers and the expansion of aquatic invasive
   species},
Journal = {WATER RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {143},
Pages = {282-291},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Inter-basin Water Transfers (IBWT) are recognized as one of the major
   pathways of freshwater invasion. They provide a direct link between
   previously isolated catchments and may modify the habitat conditions of
   the receiving waters such that they become more favourable for the
   establishment of invasive species. Combined, IBWT and invasive species
   will intensify the stress upon native species and ecosystems. Using the
   Severn and Thames Rivers two of the largest river systems in Great
   Britain as a case study, here we assess the potential influence of IBWT
   on the expansion of invasive species and thus their impact on
   biodiversity conservation. The Thames Valley is subject to extensive
   water abstraction, and an increasing population means that supplemented
   flow from the River Severn is being considered. Multi scale Suitability
   Models, based on climate and water chemistry respectively, provided
   novel evidence that there is serious risk for further spread of invasive
   species in the focus area, particularly of the quagga mussel, a recent
   invader of the Thames River. Native freshwater mussels are particularly
   vulnerable to changing environmental conditions, and may suffer the
   decrease in alkalinity and increase in sedimentation associated with an
   IBWT from the lower Severn to the upper Thames. Regional models suggest
   considerable overlap between the areas suitable for three vulnerable
   native freshwater mussels and the expansion of invasive species that
   negatively impact upon the native mussels. This study illustrates the
   use of novel spatially-explicit techniques to help managers make
   informed decisions about the risks associated with introducing aquatic
   invasive species under different engineering scenarios. Such information
   may be especially important under new legislation (e.g. EU Invasive
   Species Regulation No 1143/2014) which increases the responsibility of
   water managers to contain and not transfer invasive species into new
   locations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Ecosystem services provided by the exotic bivalves Dreissena polymorpha,
   D. rostriformis bugensis, and Limnoperna fortunei},
Journal = {HYDROBIOLOGIA},
Abstract = {The ecosystem services approach to conservation is becoming central to
   environmental policy decision making. While many negative biological
   invasion-driven impacts on ecosystem structure and functioning have been
   identified, much less was done to evaluate their ecosystem services. In
   this paper, we focus on the often-overlooked ecosystem services provided
   by three notable exotic ecosystem engineering bivalves, the zebra
   mussel, the quagga mussel, and the golden mussel. One of the most
   significant benefits of invasive bivalves is water filtration, which
   results in water purification and changes rates of nutrient cycling,
   thus mitigating the effects of eutrophication. Mussels are widely used
   as sentinel organisms for the assessment and biomonitoring of
   contaminants and pathogens and are consumed by many fishes and birds.
   Benefits of invasive bivalves are particularly relevant in
   human-modified ecosystems. We summarize the multiple ecosystem services
   provided by invasive bivalves and recommend including the economically
   quantifiable services in the assessments of their economic impacts. We
   also highlight important ecosystem disservices by exotic bivalves,
   identify data limitations, and future research directions. This
   assessment should not be interpreted as a rejection of the fact that
   invasive mussels have negative impacts, but as an attempt to provide
   additional information for scientists, managers, and policymakers.},

Abstract = {Sensitive methods, capable of rapidly and accurately detecting aquatic
   invasive species, are in demand. Molecular-based approaches, such as
   environmental DNA (eDNA) surveys, satisfy these requirements and have
   grown in popularity. As such, eDNA surveys could aid the effort to
   combat the colonisation and spread of two notoriously invasive
   freshwater mussel species, the quagga mussel (Dreissena rostriformis
   bugensis) and zebra mussel (D. polymorpha), through improved
   surveillance ability. Here, we provide a review of dreissenid eDNA
   literature (both grey and published), summarising efforts involved in
   the development of various assays for use in multiple different
   technologies (e.g. quantitative PCR, high-throughput sequencing and
   loop-mediated isothermal amplification) and sampling scenarios. We
   discuss important discoveries made along the way, including novel
   revelations involving environmental RNA (eRNA), as well as the
   advantages and limitations of available methods and instrumentation. In
   closing, we highlight critical remaining gaps, where further
   investigation could lead to advancements in dreissenid monitoring

Abstract = {1. Since their introduction to North America, zebra mussels (Dreissena
   polymorpha) and quagga mussels (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) have
   rapidly colonized North American fresh waters. Strategies for limiting
   the economic and ecological impacts of zebra mussels exist, but there
   are few examples where once zebra mussels have invaded a natural body of
   water they have been removed or managed without the use of ecologically
   destructive methods. The first successful attempt to eradicate a
   colonizing population of zebra mussels using SCUBA is reported here.
   Studies were conducted in Lake George, NY.
   2. Since zebra mussel larvae had been detected prior to the discovery of
   adults in Lake George, a comprehensive management programme for zebra
   mussels was in place when mussels were found in 1999, at a single
   location in the southern part of the Lake (Lake George Village site).
   Efforts were quickly launched to remove as many mussels as possible by
   SCUBA with the intent of minimizing the risk of the population
   reproducing and establishing a permanent presence in the Lake.
   3. Population size at the discovery site was initially estimated at
   fewer than 30 000 animals. Between 1999 and 2007 more than 21 000
   animals were removed from the site, over 90\% of them shortly after the
   colony was discovered. Continued monitoring of the site for larvae,
   recruitment, and growth suggests that the animals have not successfully
   reproduced since the project began. Since detection at the Lake George
   Village site, six separate colonizing populations at other locations in
   the lake were found and similar removal efforts appear to be having
   comparable success.
   4. This study demonstrates that the combination of early detection,
   suboptimal habitat, proactive establishment of a rapid response and
   management plan, and cooperation of a comprehensive network of
   stakeholders can prevent a successful zebra mussel invasion. Copyright

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {I pose eight questions central to understanding how biological invasions
   affect ecosystems, assess progress towards answering those questions and
   suggest ways in which progress might be made. The questions concern the
   frequency with which invasions affect ecosystems; the circumstances
   under which ecosystem change is most likely; the functions that are most
   often affected by invaders; the relationships between changes to
   ecosystems, communities, and populations; the long-term responses of
   ecosystems to invasions; interactions between biological invasions and
   other anthropogenic activities and the difficulty of managing
   undesirable impacts of non-native species. Some questions have been
   answered satisfactorily, others require more data and thought, and
   others might benefit from being reformulated or abandoned. Actions that
   might speed progress include careful development of trait-based
   approaches; strategic collection and publication of new data, including
   more frequent publication of negative results; replacement of expert
   opinion with hard data where needed; careful consideration of whether
   questions really need to be answered, especially in cases where answers
   are being provided for managers and policy-makers; explicit attention to
   and testing of the domains of theories; integrating invasions better
   into an ecosystem context; and remembering that our predictive ability
   is limited and will remain so for the foreseeable future.},

Abstract = {Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) have exacerbated the decline of
   native freshwater mussels (order Unionida) in North America since their
   arrival in the 1980s. Options for controlling invasive mussels,
   particularly in unionid mussel habitats, are limited. Previously, carbon
   dioxide (CO2) showed selective toxicity for zebra mussels, relative to
   unionids, when applied in cool water (12 degrees C). We first determined
   96-h lethal concentrations of CO(2)at 5 and 20 degrees C to zebra
   mussels and responses of juvenile plain pocketbook (Lampsilis cardium).
   Next, we compared the time to lethality for zebra mussels at 5, 12, and
   20 degrees C during exposure to partial pressure of CO2(PCO2) values of
   110 to 120 atm (1 atm = 101.325 kPa) and responses of juvenile plain
   pocketbook and fragile papershell (Leptodea fragilis). We found
   efficacious CO(2)treatment regimens at each temperature that were
   minimally lethal to unionids. At 5 degrees C, plain pocketbook survived
   96-h exposure to the highest PCO(2)treatment (139 atm). At 20 degrees C,
   the 96-h lethal concentration to 10\% of animals (LC10) for plain
   pocketbook (173 atm PCO2, 95\% CI 147-198 atm) was higher than the LC99
   for zebra mussels (118 atm PCO2, 95\% CI 109-127 atm). Lethal time to
   99\% mortality (LT99) of zebra mussels in 110 to 120 atm PCO(2)ranged
   from 100 h at 20 degrees C to 300 h at 5 degrees C. Mean survival of
   both plain pocketbook and fragile papershell juveniles exceeded 85\% in
   LT99 CO(2)treatments at all temperatures. Short-term infusion of 100 to
   200 atm PCO(2)at a range of water temperatures could reduce biofouling
   by zebra mussels with limited adverse effects on unionid mussels.Environ

Abstract = {Decades since the initial establishment of zebra mussels (Dreissena
   polymorpha) in North America, understanding and controlling the invasion
   of aquatic ecosystems continues to be a problem in continent-wide
   conservation and landscape management. While the high economic and
   conservation burden of this species makes accurate predictions of future
   invasions a research priority, forecasting is confounded by limited
   data, tenuous model assumptions, and the stochasticity of the invasion
   process. Using a new method for niche identification, we profiled
   invasion vulnerability for 1,017 lakes in the Great Lakes region of the
   Unites States. We used a nonparametric geoadditive regression model to
   test for effects of two water quality variables on the present
   distribution of zebra mussels. We then used the support vector data
   description (SVDD), a support vector machine for one-class
   classification, to estimate the boundary of the ecological niche. By
   disentangling niche estimation from distributional assumptions,
   computational niche models could be used to test an array of fundamental
   concepts in ecology and evolution, while species invasions forecasting
   is representative of the wide range of potential applications for niche
   identification in conservation and management.},

Title = {Integrating landscape connectivity and habitat suitability to guide
   offensive and defensive invasive species management},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {52},

Abstract = {1. Preventing the arrival of invasive species is the most effective way
   of controlling their impact. Preventative strategies may be `offensive'
   aimed at preventing the invader leaving colonised locations or
   `defensive' aimed at preventing its arrival at uninvaded locations. The
   limited resources for invasive species control must be prioritized,
   particularly for numerous vulnerable locations or uncertainty about
   which sites are already invaded.
   2. We developed an integrative modelling framework to prioritise
   locations for either strategy by incorporating connectivity and habitat
   suitability. We applied this framework to a data set comprising 5189
   water bodies in Wisconsin and Michigan, U.S.A, for zebra mussels
   Dreissena polymorpha and Eurasian watermilfoil Myriophyllum spicatum. We
   developed the framework with a spatial graph based on recreational
   boater movement and habitat suitability models.
   3. An historical graph comprised 3105 natural lakes connected in one of
   18 components, whereas a total of 3944 water bodies (lakes and
   reservoirs) were connected in one of 13 separate components in a graph
   of the contemporary system. Habitat suitability models accounted for
   around half of the deviance in the distribution data for each species.
   4. There was a distinct spatial pattern in the levels of risk and
   subsequent recommended allocation of management interventions across
   several levels of investment. Higher risk water bodies were generally
   found in the largest component of the spatial graph. At comparatively
   low levels of investment, where managers target 5\% of all locales to
   control D. polymorpha, the results suggested that 71\% and 27\% of this
   effort should be committed to defensive and offensive strategies,
   respectively, in the largest component. For M. spicatum, 92\% and 8\% of
   this effort should be allocated in this component to defensive and
   offensive strategies, respectively. It is only with much greater
   investment that water bodies in other components should be targeted.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Allocating limited resources to prevent
   the spread of invasive species is a challenge that transcends ecosystems
   and geography. We successfully identified a reduced number of locations
   to target for offensive and defensive intervention strategies for two
   species. This framework is readily applicable to other aquatic and
   terrestrial ecosystems vulnerable to invasive species.},

Title = {Acute Upper Thermal Limits of Three Aquatic Invasive Invertebrates: Hot
   Water Treatment to Prevent Upstream Transport of Invasive Species},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2011},

Number = {1},
Pages = {67-76},

Abstract = {Transport of aquatic invasive species (AIS) by boats traveling up rivers
   and streams is an important mechanism of secondary spread of AIS into
   watersheds. Because physical barriers to AIS movement also prevent
   navigation, alternate methods for preventing spread are necessary while
   allowing upstream navigation. One promising approach is to lift boats
   over physical barriers and then use hot water immersion to kill AIS
   attached to the hull, motor, or fishing gear. However, few data have
   been published on the acute upper thermal tolerance limits of potential
   invaders treated in this manner. To test the potential effectiveness of
   this approach for a planned boat lift on the Fox River of northeastern
   WI, USA, acute upper thermal limits were determined for three AIS, adult
   zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha), quagga mussels (Dreissena
   rostriformis bugensis), and spiny water fleas (Bythotrephes longimanus)
   from the local area employing temperatures from 32 to 54 degrees C and
   immersion times from 1 to 20 min. Mortality was determined after
   immersion followed by a 20-min recovery period. Immersion at 43 degrees
   C for at least 5 min was required to ensure 100\% mortality for all
   three species, but due to variability in the response by Bythotrephes a
   10 min immersion would be more reliable. Overall there were no
   significant differences between the three species in acute upper thermal
   limits. Heated water can be an efficient, environmentally sound, and
   cost effective method of controlling AIS potentially transferred by
   boats, and our results should have both specific and wide-ranging
   applications in the prevention of the spread of aquatic invasive
   species.},

Title = {Predicting the spread of aquatic invaders: insight from 200 years of
   invasion by zebra mussels},

Abstract = {Understanding factors controlling the introduction and spread of species
   is crucial to improving the management of both natural populations and
   introduced species. The zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, is
   considered the most aggressive freshwater invader in the Northern
   Hemisphere, and is a convenient model system for invasion biology,
   offering one of the best aquatic examples for examining the invasion
   process. We used data on 553 of the 1040 glacial lakes in the Republic
   of Belarus that were examined for the presence of zebra mussels. We used
   these data to build, test, and construct modified models to predict the
   spread of this invader, including selection of important parameters that
   could limit the spread of this invader. In spite of 200 years of
   continuous invasion, by 1996, zebra mussels were found in only 16.8\% of
   all lakes studied. Of those lakes without zebra mussels in 1996, 66\%
   were predicted to be susceptible to invasion by zebra mussels in the
   future, and 33\% were predicted to be immune to successful invasion due
   to their water chemistry. Eighty lakes free of zebra mussels in 1996
   were reexamined from 1997 to 2008. Of these, zebra mussels successfully
   invaded an additional 31 lakes, all of which were classified initially
   as suitable for zebra mussels; none of the lakes previously classified
   as unsuitable were invaded. We used the Random Forests classification
   algorithm with 16 environmental variables to determine the most
   important factors that differed between invaded lakes and those lakes
   suitable for invasion that have not yet been invaded. Distance to the
   nearest infested lakes was found to be the most important variable,
   followed by the lake area, color, average depth, and concentration of
   chloride, magnesium, and bicarbonate. This study provides a useful
   approach for predicting the spread of an invader across a landscape with
   variable habitat suitability that can be applied to a variety of species
   and systems.},

Abstract = {Estimation of carrying capacity for bivalves is generally carried out
   for mussel culture systems wherein maximizing mussel numbers requires
   the consideration of both ecological and economic endpoints. We adapted
   an existing culture-system model to estimate potential carrying capacity
   of an invasive species, the quagga mussel (Dreissena rostriformis
   bugensis) in the Boulder Basin of Lake Mead, Nevada. We parameterized
   the model using both field measurements and known quantities previously
   published in the literature. To make this model most useful to
   ecologists and managers, we provide a detailed description and
   derivation, as well as an example calculation for the model. The model
   is based on mean Chlorophyll a concentrations in the Boulder Basin of
   Lake Mead, and the number of quagga mussels needed to filter a given
   reduction in food particles from the water column. Estimates ranged from
   a total of 1.51 x 10(12) mussels with a net reduction of 50\% of food
   particles to 1.02 x 10(13) mussels when the net reduction was at the
   threshold level of survival (0.017 mu g/L). Limitations to the model and
   potential environmental and ecological considerations are discussed.},

Title = {Predicting habitat use and trophic interactions of Eurasian ruffe, round
   gobies, and zebra mussels in nearshore areas of the Great Lakes},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {9},
Number = {6},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The Laurentian Great Lakes have been subject to numerous introductions
   of nonindigenous species, including two recent benthic fish invaders,
   Eurasian ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernuus) and round gobies (Neogobius
   melanostomus), as well as the benthic bivalve, zebra mussel (Dreissena
   polymorpha). These three exotic species, or ``exotic triad,{''} may
   impact nearshore benthic communities due to their locally high
   abundances and expanding distributions. Laboratory experiments were
   conducted to determine (1) whether ruffe and gobies may compete for
   habitat and invertebrate food in benthic environments, and (2) if zebra
   mussels can alter those competitive relationships by serving as an
   alternate food source for gobies. In laboratory mesocosms, both gobies
   and ruffe preferred cobble and macrophyte areas to open sand either when
   alone or in sympatry. In a 9-week goby-ruffe competition experiment
   simulating an invasion scenario with a limited food base, gobies grew
   faster than did ruffe, suggesting that gobies may be competitively
   superior at low resource levels. When zebra mussels were added in a
   short-term experiment, the presence or absence of mussels did not affect
   goby or ruffe growth, as few zebra mussels were consumed. This finding,
   along with other laboratory evidence, suggests that gobies may prefer
   soft-bodied invertebrate prey over zebra mussels. Studies of
   interactions among the ``exotic triad{''}, combined with continued
   surveillance, may help Great Lakes fisheries managers to predict future
   population sizes and distributions of these invasive fish, evaluate
   their impacts on native food webs, and direct possible control measures
   to appropriate species.},

Title = {Cyanobacteria reduce quagga mussel (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis)
   spawning and fertilization success},
Journal = {FRESHWATER SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {37},

Abstract = {Quagga mussels (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) are highly fecund
   broadcast spawners invasive to fresh-waters of North America and western
   Europe. We hypothesized that environmental cues from phytoplankton can
   trigger gamete release in quagga mussels. Nutritious algae may stimulate
   dreissenid spawning, but less palatable food, such as bloom-forming
   cyanobacteria, could be a hindrance. The objective of our study was to
   test whether exposure to cyanobacteria can inhibit quagga mussel
   spawning and fertilization. We assessed spawning in the presence of
   serotonin, a known spawning inducer, where adult quagga mussels placed
   in individual vials were exposed to 13 cyanobacteria cultures and
   purified algal toxin (microcystin-LR) with artificial lake water as the
   control. Fertilization success was evaluated by combining eggs with
   sperm in conjunction with cyanobacteria, and enumerating zygote
   formation marked by cellular cleavage. Several cyanobacterial strains
   reduced spawning and fertilization success, but microcystin-LR had no
   effect. Fertilization was more sensitive to cyanobacteria than gamete
   release. Only 1 culture, Aphanizomenon floc-aquae, inhibited spawning,
   whereas 6 cultures consisting of Anabaena flos-aquae, Dolichospermum
   lemmermang Gloeotrichia echinulata, Lyngbya wollei, and 2 Microcystis
   aeruginosa isolates reduced fertilization rates by up to 44\%. The
   effects of cyanobacteria on reproduction in invasive freshwater mussels
   in the wild have not yet been identified. However, our laboratory
   studies show that concentrations of cyanobacteria that are possible
   during bloom conditions probably limit reproduction. Reproductive
   consequences on wild populations may become more prevalent as
   cyanobacteria blooms occur earlier in the year, making overlap between
   blooms and mussel spawning more common. Describing the mechanism by
   which cyanobacteria inhibit spawning and fertilization could reveal
   novel control methods to limit reproduction of this invasive species},

Abstract = {The distribution, density, biomass and size-structure of the zebra
   mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) population in Lake Winnipeg were examined
   between 2017 and 2019. Zebra mussels have colonized most of the
   available hard substrate in the south basin and Narrows region, but
   colonization of the north basin remains low at present, even on suitable
   substrate. Numerical densities and shell free biomass peaked at 5530 +/-
   953 m(-2) and 64.7 +/- 57.9 g shell free dry mass m(-2) respectively.
   The distribution appeared to be strongly limited by substrate type and
   availability, with further limitations on the distribution imposed by
   physical disturbance in shallow waters and unsuitable substrate in
   deeper areas of the lake. Zebra mussels <1 year old dominated the
   populations, and individuals >18 mm were exceedingly rare. Poor
   recruitment was observed at sites along the eastern side of the south
   basin compared to elsewhere in the lake. The proximate causes of these
   differences in colonization success and recruitment are not clear, but
   may be in part due to heterogeneous patterns of key physico-chemical
   environmental conditions such as calcium concentrations required for
   successful development of juvenile mussels and colder water temperatures
   in the north basin. This study provides a baseline of information on
   which to track further expansion of zebra mussels in Lake Winnipeg and
   assist efforts to develop an understanding of how zebra mussels may
   affect the ecology of Lake Winnipeg. Crown Copyright (C) 2020 Published

Title = {Lake Michigan's suitability for bigheaded carp: The importance of diet
   flexibility and subsurface habitat},
Journal = {FRESHWATER BIOLOGY},

Pages = {1921-1939},

Abstract = {As bighead (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) and silver carp
   (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix)-collectively bigheaded carp (BHC)-arrive
   at Lake Michigan's doorstep, questions remain as to whether there is
   sufficient food to support these invasive filter-feeding fishes in the
   upper Laurentian Great Lakes. Previous studies suggest that suitable BHC
   habitat is limited to a few productive, nearshore areas. However, those
   studies did not consider the influence of BHC's diet plasticity or the
   presence of spatially-discrete subsurface prey resources. This study
   aimed to characterise Lake Michigan's suitability for BHC and evaluate
   the importance of these considerations in habitat suitability
   assessments. We used simulated outputs of prey biomass (phytoplankton,
   zooplankton, and detritus) and water temperature from a
   three-dimensional biophysical model of Lake Michigan to evaluate growth
   rate potential (GRP, quantitative index of habitat suitability) of adult
   BHC throughout the entire volume of the lake. Our GRP model applied a
   foraging model and a bioenergetics model to translate prey
   concentrations and water temperatures into habitat quality indexed by
   individual fish growth rate. We defined suitable habitat as habitats
   that can support GRP >= 0 g g(-1) day(-1). We developed six feeding
   scenarios to evaluate the impact of diet flexibility and subsurface prey
   resources on suitable habitat quantity. Scenarios were defined by the
   number of prey types the fish could consume and the depths at which they
   could feed (surface or whole water column). Consistent with previous
   studies, we found that habitats with the highest quality were
   concentrated near river mouths and in eutrophic areas of Green Bay.
   However, in contrast to previous studies, we found suitable offshore
   habitat for bighead carp owing to our added considerations of diet
   plasticity and subsurface prey resources. For silver carp, these
   considerations extended suitable habitat within Green Bay and in some
   tributary-influenced nearshore areas, but offshore areas remained
   predominantly unsuitable in all feeding scenarios. Differences in
   simulated habitat suitability between these two species probably reflect
   differences in energy density and mass of the specific fishes we used in
   our model. However, reports of these two species in environments where
   they coexist indicate that bighead carp grow at faster rates than silver
   carp, as our model simulated. Our vertical analysis at Muskegon, MI,
   U.S.A. indicates that subsurface temperature and prey biomass are not
   only sufficient to support bighead carp growth but provide maximum
   habitat quality during late summer stratification. Overall, our study
   demonstrates that BHC are capable of surviving and growing in much
   larger areas of Lake Michigan than predicted by previous studies, and
   thus suggests that the risk of establishment is not sufficiently reduced
   by low plankton concentrations. Maps generated by our model identified
   the potential for cross-lake migration corridors that may facilitate and
   accelerate lake-wide movements. We believe these maps could be used to
   prioritise surveillance protocols by identifying areas to which BHC
   might spread upon entering the lake. More broadly, this research
   demonstrates how the physiology and trophic ecology of BHC contributes
   to their high invasive capacity and can permit their survival in novel
   environments.},

Title = {Review of techniques to prevent introduction of zebra mussels (Dreissena

Abstract = {Because of the declines in diversity and abundance of native freshwater
   mussels (superfamily Unionoidea), and the potential decimation of
   populations of native mussels resulting from the rapid spread of the
   exotic zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha, management options to
   eliminate or reduce the threat of the zebra mussel are needed.
   Relocating native mussels to refugia (artificial and natural) has been
   proposed to mitigate the threat of zebra mussels to native species.
   Relocation of native mussels to refugia such as fish hatchery facilities
   or natural habitats within their historic range. which are unlikely to
   be infested by zebra mussels, necessitates that protocols be developed
   to prevent the inadvertent introduction of zebra mussels. Several recent
   studies have developed Such protocols, and have assessed their
   effectiveness on the health and survival of native mussels during
   subsequent relocation to various refugia. The purpose of this project is
   to synthesize and evaluate the current protocols and to develop a set of
   procedures that resource managers and researchers should consider before
   conducting conservation activities in zebra mussel infested waters. We
   found that the existing protocols have many common points of concern,
   such as facility modification and suitability, zebra mussel risk
   assessment and management procedures, and health and disease management
   procedures. These conservation protocols may have broad applicability to
   other situations and locations. A summary and evaluation of the
   information in these main areas, along with recommended guidelines, are
   presented in this article.},

Volume = {39},

Abstract = {Two invasive freshwater mussels, Dreissena rostriformis bugensis (quagga
   mussel) and D. polymorpha (zebra mussel), reveal differences in patterns
   and timing of their invasions in Europe. They belong to different clades
   in Dreissena phylogenetics: D. rostriformis bugensis genetically is
   coupled with the brackish water, lacustrine D. r. distincta and the two
   are believed to represent a single species. As such, the guaqqa mussel
   has environmental requirements that differ from the congeneric D.
   polymorpha. D. rostriformis bugensis invasions were confined to
   reservoirs of the Dnieper, Don and Dniester Rivers of the Black Sea
   basin. We recorded D. r. bugensis outside the Black Sea basin for the
   first time between 1992 and 2001, along the Volga River reservoir
   cascade including the Northern Caspian Sea shallows. This represents a
   40-year invasion time lag since an invasion corridor through the
   Volgo-Don Waterway was established in 1952 (a corridor used extensively
   by many invertebrate species from the Black Sea region). We attribute
   the postponed invasion of Europe by D. r. bugensis, including
   peculiarities in establishment and its absence in fossil records, to its
   phylogenetically close relationship with D. r. distincta and its recent
   evolutionary origin. The relatively rapid range expansion of D. r.
   bugensis in eastern Europe during the past several decades was
   facilitated by human-mediated ecosystem transformation, notably
   impoundment of large eastern European rivers, that have allowed this
   species to utilize newly transformed ecosystems.},

Abstract = {The invasion of North American waters by Dreissena polymorpha (zebra
   mussel) and its subsequent ecological impacts has been well documented.
   Their spread continues to new states and watersheds despite a wealth of
   research and outreach campaigns, albeit at a slowed pace. We describe
   the spread and proliferation of zebra mussel into one of the more
   recently invaded states, Maryland, USA. Veliger counts and fixed hard
   surface monitoring suggest that a population is established within the
   lower Susquehanna River to the head of the Chesapeake Bay. A relatively
   narrow tidal-freshwater habitat envelope with suitable salinity may
   serve to restrict zebra mussel dispersal further downstream. Dispersal
   to other freshwater habitats in Maryland seems likely as the current
   area of infestation is highly used by commercial and recreational
   boaters, although regulations are in place that could help slow or
   prevent spread. Successful invasion will likely be a function of water
   chemistry, which may be limiting in some parts of the state.},

Volume = {151},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Infestation by introduced zebra mussels has extirpated native unionids
   in many Great Lake habitats. Shallow areas in coastal wetlands are
   intermittently dewatered by seiches and seasonal water level changes,
   and we examined how water level fluctuations and sediment
   characteristics affected interactions among unionids and zebra mussels
   in a Lake Erie coastal marsh. In 2001 we sampled unionid distributions
   and measured zebra mussel colonization on PVC plates at I cm, 18 cm and
   >35 cm water depths. We found a diverse unionid community (15 species)
   with many juvenile unionids. Unionid densities (0.01 unionids/m(2)) were
   comparable to other coastal wetlands, but are lower than reported in
   offshore areas before zebra mussels were introduced. Zebra mussels
   colonized plates at >3000 individuals/m(2) in some locations. Although
   >60\% of unionids had byssal threads on their shells, >75\% of unionids
   had no attached zebra mussels. Therefore, zebra mussels are colonizing
   unionids, but are not surviving. Unionid numbers and zebra mussel
   colonization were low in shallow (1-35 cm) water depths, indicating that
   water level fluctuations limited their distributions. Only two species
   of unionids were collected in 1-17 cm deep areas, and areas that became
   mudflats in September had almost no unionids. Numbers of zebra mussels
   and unionids were not correlated with organic content or silt/clay
   content of the sediments. Habitat characteristics shared by this wetland
   and other coastal wetlands that are important refuges of unionids
   include: a hydrological connection with the lake, areas deep enough for
   unionids to survive low water levels and soft sediments that allow
   unionid burrowing.},

Abstract = {The round goby, Neogobius melanostomus (Pallas, 1814), is one of the
   most invasive non-indigenous species in the Baltic Sea. It dominates
   coastal fisheries in some localities and is frequently found in offshore
   pelagic catches. This paper identifies management issues and suggests
   actions to be considered for post-invasion management. Priority should
   be given to the establishment of a coordinated pan-Baltic monitoring
   programme and associated data storage and exchange, as well as the
   compilation of landing statistics of the round goby in commercial and
   recreational fisheries. While eradication is unrealistic, population
   control that leads to minimising the risk of transfer to yet uncolonised
   areas in the Baltic Sea and adjacent waterbodies is feasible. This
   should comprise the requirement that the species be landed in commercial
   fishery bycatch, the management of ships' ballast water and sediments,
   and hull fouling of inland and sea-going vessels, including recreational
   boats. Extensive involvement of stakeholders is crucial at all phases of
   the management process.},

Title = {Multiple factors regulate filtration by invasive mussels: Implications
   for whole-lake ecosystems},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {765},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {The quagga mussel (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) is a filter-feeding
   invasive species that has re-engineered many freshwater ecosystems
   worldwide. High clearance rates (CRs) and dense populations underpin
   their ecological impacts. CRs, however, are highly variable, as are
   environmental factors that regulate them. Despite their widespread
   distribution in Europe and North America, knowledge of how multiple
   environmental factors regulate CRs of quagga mussels remains limited. We
   investigated quagga mussel CRs under varying conditions including water
   temperature, food availability, habitat depth, flow velocity, and
   duration of incubation in chambers with both static and flowing water.
   We found that CR was positively related to water temperature and initial
   food concentration in static chambers. When coupled with limited food
   concentration, coldwater (7.5 degrees C), due to a deep-water upwelling
   event, produced very low CR (similar to 10x lower) compared to warmer
   water (12-24 degrees C) (0.47 vs. 3.12-5.84 L g(-1) DW h(-1)). Mussels
   from deeper water (20 m) had CRs that were similar to 3.5x higher than
   from shallower depths (2-10 m) and CRs were inversely affected by total
   mussel dry weight. Flowrates from1 to 22 cms(-1) generated a unimodal
   pattern of CR with an optimal flow velocity of 6-12 cm s(-1) (similar to
   2x higher than suboptimal CRs). Enhanced flow velocity (22 cm s(-1)),
   reflective of storm conditions in shallow waters, significantly
   increased the closing/reopening activity of mussel valves relative to
   lower velocities (1-12 cm s(-1)). Incubation time had a strong negative
   effect (similar to 2-4x reduction) on CRs likely reflecting refiltration
   in static chambers versus food saturation of mussels in flowing
   chambers, respectively. Our findings highlight how multiple factors can
   influence quagga mussel CRs by factors of 2-10. Givenwidespread habitat
   heterogeneity in large aquatic ecosystems, whole-lake estimates of
   mussel impacts should include multiple regulatory factors that affect
   mussel filtration. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We examined trends in expansion patterns and relative abundances of
   Dreissena bugensis in reservoirs and major river systems in eastern
   Europe. Based on our own data and data from the literature, it is
   apparent that trends were variable across river basins and not easily
   related to environmental conditions. In some cases these did not conform
   to the patterns typically found for dreissenids. In the early period of
   expansion beyond its native range in the Dnieper-Bug delta and estuary,
   D. bugensis rapidly replaced Dreissena polymorpha in the upper Dnieper
   River system, but increased only gradually and over time became less
   abundant relative to D. polymorpha in the Don-Manych River system.
   Contrary to the Dnieper and Don River systems, in the Volga River system
   considerable spatial variability in relative abundances was apparent,
   particularly in northern reservoirs. Moreover, even though D. bugensis
   usually displaces D. polymorpha as the dominant dreissenid, the latter
   can remain dominant in certain types of habitats where conditions are
   less favourable for the former. Suggested factors that may be
   responsible for differences in invasion patterns in the river systems
   may include differential responses to temperature, or to some other
   factor(s) associated with geographical latitude, the level of water
   mineralization, and selective predation by molluscivorous fish. In
   particular, the northward expansion of D. bugensis seems to be limited
   by temperature. The lack of long-term data on appropriate scales
   precludes linking these differences to specific features within the
   environment, but our comparisons indicate that the expansion of D.
   bugensis relative to D. polymorpha is more complex than previously
   believed.},

Title = {Historic nutrient loading and recent species invasions caused shifts in
   water quality and zooplankton demography in two Finger Lakes (New York,
   USA)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY},

Volume = {48},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {We investigated the paleolimnology of Owasco and Seneca Lakes (New York,
   USA) and compiled water-quality monitoring data to describe
   environmental change during the past two centuries. Trophic shifts were
   detected in the oligotrophic to mesotrophic range and were likely driven
   by nutrient loading and species invasion. Based on box core
   reconstructions, primary production increased in both lakes during the
   last century, which is evidenced by the amount, type and isotopic
   composition of material preserved in the sediment. Organic matter
   accumulation and its stable carbon isotopic composition, as well as
   carbonate abundance, began to increase during the 1960s in Owasco Lake
   and the 1850s in Seneca Lake. Further, the abundance of
   phytoplanktivorous cladocera subfossils increased beginning in the 1910s
   in Seneca Lake and in the 1960s in Owasco Lake. The different timing and
   magnitude of the trophic shifts likely resulted from contrasts in lake
   residence time and species assemblages between the two lakes. The
   increases in primary and secondary production paralleled, and are
   interpreted to reflect, increased allochthonous nutrient loading.
   However, nutrient loading was not detected in the water-quality data,
   perhaps because of strong uptake of phosphates by phytoplankton or due
   to limited data collection. Rapid changes in cladoceran subfossils and
   water quality were also detected during the last decade. Concurrent with
   the establishment of non-native Cercopagis pengoi (fishhook waterflea),
   phytoplanktivorous cladocera remains declined, and the mucrone length of
   Bosmina increased, consistent with predictions of increased invertebrate
   predation. Additionally, the post-1990 decline in sediment carbonate,
   increased Secchi depth and decreased chlorophyll a concentrations
   followed the establishment of filter-feeding Dreissena spp. (zebra and
   quagga mussels). Collectively, paleolimnological data and water-quality
   monitoring provided a more complete and consistent record of shifts in
   the productivity of Owasco and Seneca Lakes, which were useful to
   understand environmental changes over different time scales. Physical,
   geochemical and biological changes were temporally consistent among
   three cores collected from different locations in each lake, but
   differed in magnitude for several variables (e.g., grain size and
   cladoceran subfossils), which could reflect near-shore to offshore
   gradients.},

Title = {Behavioural changes of zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha (Bivalvia)
   induced by Ponto-Caspian gammarids},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {14},
Number = {9},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Colonies of an invasive Ponto-Caspian zebra mussel constitute suitable
   habitats for many invertebrate organisms, including Ponto-Caspian
   gammarids that are now spreading throughout Europe. There is, however,
   little known of the impact of these gammarids on their mussel hosts
   which they live amongst. We studied the behaviour of zebra mussels in
   the presence of three gammarid species that differed in their origin and
   degree of association with Dreissena habitats. In the presence of the
   Ponto-Caspian invader Dikerogammarus villosus that was commonly observed
   in mussel habitats, mussels responded by increasing their attachment
   strength and reducing upward movement. The responses to the
   Ponto-Caspian Pontogammarus robustoides, a species that showed no
   preferences for mussel habitats, were weaker and limited to the increase
   of attachment strength. There were no behavioural changes in mussels
   exposed to the native Gammarus fossarum. As mussels only responded to
   gammarids moving freely among their shells and not to those kept behind
   a mesh barrier, the most likely factor causing these changes was
   mechanical irritation of their soft parts by amphipod appendages. This
   hypothesis was further confirmed in an additional experiment with a
   South-American catfish Corydoras paleatus used as another potential
   source of mechanical irritation. The responses of zebra mussels to
   gammarids were similar to their anti-predator defences shown earlier in
   the presence of molluscivorous roach. Thus, it appears likely that Ponto
   Caspian gammarids within mussel colonies have the capacity to compromise
   the normal functioning of bivalves through inducing their defensive
   responses.},

Abstract = {Invasive mussels cause significant problems in water bodies-and for
   water utilities. The golden mussel Limnoperna fortunei-like its zebra
   and quagga mussel cousins-has serious environmental and ecologic effects
   on the habitats it invades. Native to Asia, the bivalve was likely
   introduced in South America by transocean ships in the early 1990s.
   First detected in Argentina along the coasts of the Rio de la Plata
   Estuary, L. fortunei spread westward and northward and has reached as
   far north as Brazil into the Pantanal, the world's largest wetland.
   In this study, small (7-mm) and large (20-mm) mussels were exposed to
   anoxic conditions under two temperatures (20 and 27 degrees C). The
   authors found that in industrial installations, regardless of its
   physiologic effect (which was not studied), anoxia is an economic,
   effective, and environmentally innocuous alternative for the control of
   L. fortunei.
   Although this mussel is more resistant than Dreissena polymorpha at
   higher temperatures, this study did show that 100\% mortalities can be
   achieved in slightly more than a week. Other researchers have predicted
   that L. fortunei's ability to tolerate conditions that limit other
   mussels could help promote its spread into the drainage systems of three
   rivers in North America: the Rio Grande, the Colorado, and the
   Mississippi.},

Title = {Metabarcoding of native and invasive species in stomach contents of
   Great Lakes fishes},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 11},
Abstract = {As aquatic invasive species (AIS) proliferate worldwide, a better
   understanding of their roles in invaded habitats is needed to inform
   management and introduction prevention strategies and priorities.
   Metabarcoding of stomach content DNA (scDNA) shows considerable promise
   in such regard. We thus metabarcoded scDNA from two non-native fish
   species (alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) and rainbow smelt (Osmerus
   mordax)), and three native ones (bloater (Coregonus hoyi), ninespine
   stickleback (Pungitius pungitius), and slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus)).
   Fishes (N = 376) were sampled in spring 2009 and 2010 from 73-128 m
   depths at three Lake Michigan sites. Four mitochondrial cytochrome
   oxidase 1 (CO1) primer sets designed to target five potential AIS prey,
   and a universal aquatic invertebrate CO1 primer set targeting both
   native and AIS prey were used. Quality controlled prey amplicons were
   matched to three AIS prey:Bythotrephes longimanus(mean percent frequency
   occurrence, all samples = 7\%),Cercopagis pengoi(5\%), andDreissena
   rostriformis bugensis(11\%). Neither invasive preyDreissena
   polymorphanorHemimysis anomalawere detected. Native preyLeptodiaptomus
   sicilis,Limnocalanus macrurus, andMysis diluvianawere relatively common
   in scDNA (respective mean percent occurrences, all samples: 48\%, 25\%,
   42\%). Analysis of variation in prey occurrences for sample site,
   predator species, sample year, sample depth, and predator total length
   (TL) indicated site and predator species were most important.
   However,B.longimanusoccurrence in scDNA depended upon predator TL,
   perhaps indicative of its unique defensive spine limiting susceptibility
   to predation until fishes exceed species-specific gape-based
   limitations. Our analysis of native and invasive prey species indicated
   possible indirect AIS impacts such as native predators switching their
   diet due to AIS-driven losses of preferred native prey. Metabarcoding
   demonstrated that AIS are integrated components of the offshore Lake
   Michigan food web, with both native and non-native predators, and both
   invasive and native prey are affecting species interactions across
   multiple trophic levels.},

Abstract = {Species invasions are modifying ecosystems worldwide. Coexistence of
   invasive species of no common evolutionary history in their new ranges
   enables the study of ecological rules shaping novel communities at their
   initial stages. In oligohaline parts of the Baltic Sea, the most
   dominant and widespread epifaunal suspension feeders are invasive
   mussels Dreissena polymorpha and cirripeds Amphibalanus improvisus. This
   study experimentally evaluated recruitment and microhabitat use in
   response to environmental forcing in these two species in a eutrophic
   bay. Recruitment was structured by different microhabitat exploitation
   patterns coupled with both individual and interactive effects of several
   environmental gradients. Despite functional similarity, the importance
   of environmental gradients differed between these species: mussel
   recruitment was best explained by temperature while barnacle recruitment
   was best explained by wave exposure. Zebra mussels were more fastidious
   about surface orientation than barnacles. The preferred orientations
   also differed between species, as mussels strongly preferred horizontal
   surfaces, while barnacles were more abundant on vertical surfaces.
   Increase in one species also predicted well the abundance of the other,
   especially for barnacles, as mussel abundance was the best predictor of
   barnacle abundance over all the other factors. The extent of
   microhabitat segregation correlated weakly over the studied range of the
   most important environmental gradients. The study shows that coexistence
   of functionally similar non-native D. polymorpha and A. improvisus in
   their sympatric range is likely determined by complex interactions
   between these species, their different microhabitat exploitation
   patterns, environmental limitations and optima. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Assessing the effects of climate change on aquatic invasive species},

Abstract = {Different components of global environmental change are typically
   studied and managed independently, although there is a growing
   recognition that multiple drivers often interact in complex and
   nonadditive ways. We present a conceptual framework and empirical review
   of the interactive effects of climate change and invasive species in
   freshwater ecosystems, Climate change is expected to result in warmer
   water temperatures, shorter duration of ice cover, altered streamflow
   patterns, increased salinization, and increased demand for water storage
   and conveyance structures. These changes will alter the pathways by
   which non-native species enter aquatic systems by expanding fish-culture
   facilities and water gardens to new areas and by facilitating the spread
   of species during floods. Climate change will influence the likelihood
   of new species becoming established by eliminating cold temperatures or
   winter hypoxia that currently prevent survival and by increasing the
   construction of reservoirs that serve as hotspots for invasive species.
   Climate change will modify the ecological impacts of invasive species by
   enhancing their competitive and predatory effects on native species and
   by increasing the virulence of some diseases. As a result of climate
   change, new prevention and control strategies such as barrier
   construction or removal efforts may be needed to control invasive
   species that currently have only moderate effects or that are limited by
   seasonally unfavorable conditions, Although most researchers focus on
   how climate change will increase the number and severity of invasions,
   some invasive coldwater species may be unable to persist under the new
   climate conditions. Our findings highlight the complex interactions
   between climate change and invasive species that will influence how
   aquatic ecosystems and their biota will respond to novel environmental
   conditions.},

Title = {Long-term demography of a zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) population},
Journal = {FRESHWATER BIOLOGY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {51},
Number = {1},
Pages = {117-130},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {1. We used long-term data and a simulation model to investigate temporal
   fluctuations in zebra mussel populations, which govern the ecological
   and economic impacts of this pest species.
   2. The size of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) population in the
   Hudson River estuary fluctuated approximately 11-fold across a 13-year
   period, following a cycle with a 2-4 year period.
   3. This cycling was caused by low recruitment during years of high adult
   population size, rapid somatic growth of settled animals, and adult
   survivorship of 50\% per year.
   4. Adult growth and body condition were weakly correlated with
   phytoplankton biomass.
   5. The habitat distribution of the Hudson's population changed over the
   13-year period, with an increasing proportion of the population
   spreading onto soft sediments over time. The character of soft-sediment
   habitats in the Hudson changed because of large amounts (mean = 34 g DM
   m(-2)) of empty zebra mussel shells now in the sediments.
   6. Simulation models show that zebra mussel populations can show a range
   of long-term trajectories, depending on the balance between adult space
   limitation, larval food limitation, and disturbance.
   7. Effective understanding and management of the effects of zebra
   mussels and other alien species depend on understanding of their
   long-term demography, which may vary across ecosystems.},

Title = {Status of Freshwater Mussels (Unionidae) in the French Creek Watershed,
   USA at the Onset of Invasion by Round Goby, Neogobius melanostomus},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Freshwater mussels are an imperiled group of organisms that are vital to
   aquatic ecosystems. Services performed by freshwater mussels, coupled
   with their use for biomonitoring, make them an invaluable asset.
   Neogobius melanostomus (Round Goby), a recently introduced invasive
   species to the French Creek watershed, was once restricted to the
   watershed of Lake Erie in Pennsylvania. The Round Goby's propensity to
   consume Dreissena polymorpha (Zebra Mussel) and Dreissena bugensis
   (Quagga Mussel) in their native habitat raises concerns about this
   recent introduction into Pennsylvania's Allegheny River watershed. Since
   the discovery of their introduction within the watershed, we have
   followed the range expansion and dispersal rate of Round Gobies, which
   makes this study unique. The objectives of this study were to quantify
   baseline data on the contemporary diversity and abundance of unionid
   mussels in the upper French Creek watershed, and to explore potential
   habitat factors that influence or limit the size of the mussel
   populations. We gathered baseline data on freshwater mussel diversity
   and abundances across eight sites in the French Creek watershed and
   examined substrate particle size and host availability as potential
   limiting factors of the freshwater mussel distribution. Freshwater
   mussel surveys were conducted during the summer months (July-September)
   of 2017 using area-constrained surveys. Results showed a significant
   relationship between mussel diversity and substrate particle size (p <
   0.05). From the data collected, we were able to calculate population
   estimates for the species found across the sample sites. Our results
   regarding the locations of native mussel populations and characteristics
   of their habitat provide the needed insight for establishing priority
   areas for the conservation of freshwater mussels, facilitating planning
   for protection, mitigation, and adaptation as the invasive Round Goby
   continues its spread.},

Title = {Evolutionary mechanisms of habitat invasions, using the copepod

Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {248-270},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The study of the copepod Eurytemora affinis has provided unprecedented
   insights into mechanisms of invasive success. In this invited review, I
   summarize a subset of work from my laboratory to highlight key insights
   gained from studying E. affinis as a model system. Invasive species with
   brackish origins are overrepresented in freshwater habitats. The copepod
   E. affinis is an example of such a brackish invader, and has invaded
   freshwater habitats multiple times independently in recent years. These
   invasions were accompanied by the evolution of physiological tolerance
   and plasticity, increased body fluid regulation, and evolutionary shifts
   in ion transporter (V-type H+ ATPase, Na+, K+-ATPase) activity and
   expression. These evolutionary changes occurred in parallel across
   independent invasions in nature and in laboratory selection experiments.
   Selection appears to act on standing genetic variation during invasions,
   and maintenance of this variation is likely facilitated through
   `beneficial reversal of dominance' in salinity tolerance across
   habitats. Expression of critical ion transporters is localized in newly
   discovered Crusalis leg organs. Increased freshwater tolerance is
   accompanied by costs to development time and greater requirements for
   food. High-food concentration increases low-salinity tolerance, allowing
   saline populations to invade freshwater habitats. Mechanisms observed
   here likely have relevance for other taxa undergoing fundamental niche
   expansions.},

Volume = {74},

Abstract = {We performed dynamic linear modeling analysis on fish contaminant data
   collected from the Ontario Ministry of the Environment and Environment
   Canada to examine long-term trends of total mercury (THg) and
   polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in Lake Erie. Several sport fish
   species (walleye, smallmouth bass, rainbow trout) with differences in
   their diet habits, food competition strategies and foraging patterns are
   characterized by weakly increasing trends of their THg levels in Lake
   Erie after the mid- or late 1990s. Similarly, our analysis shows that
   the decline rates of the PCB body burdens in white bass, smallmouth
   bass, freshwater drum and whitefish have slowed down or have switched to
   weakly increasing rates over the last decade. Our analysis also provides
   evidence that the rainbow trout and coho salmon PCB concentrations have
   been decreasing steadily but the associated rates were fairly weak. The
   systematic shifts in energy trophodynamics along with the food web
   alterations induced from the introduction of non-native species, the new
   role of the sediments as a net contaminant source, and the potentially
   significant fluxes from the atmosphere stand out as some of the
   hypotheses proposed to explain the limited Lake Erie response in recent
   years to the various contamination mitigation strategies. (C) 2011

Year = {2008},
Volume = {34},

Abstract = {Although numbers of buffleheads (Bucephala albeola), common goldeneyes
   (Bucephala clangula) and long-tailed ducks (Clangula hyemalis)
   over-wintering on Lake Ontario have increased substantially over the
   past two decades, factors influencing habitat use and the potential for
   competition have not been investigated. The purpose of this study was to
   determine the relationship between prey availability and community
   structure of diving ducks during winter on northeastern Lake Ontario.
   Benthic and nektonic samples collected during fall, winter, and spring
   2002-2004 indicated that macroinvertebrate numbers differed by location
   but generally did not decline throughout winter. Large accumulations of
   macroinvertebrates, apparently moved by wave action and currents, were
   documented in nearshore areas. Surveys showed that diving ducks
   congregated in mixed species flocks within areas of higher food
   abundance. Mixed species flocks were common in nearshore areas, likely
   because energy-dense foods (Amphipoda and Chironomidae) were abundant in
   the narrow zone of shallow water, close to shore. Although
   macroinvertebrate numbers likely affected habitat use by diving ducks,
   birds did not greatly reduce abundance of macroinvertebrates. It is
   unlikely that exploitative competition was occurring and interference
   competition appeared below threshold levels that would cause species to
   spatially segregate. Overall, our results suggest that food availability
   is not a limiting factor for buffleheads, common goldeneyes, or
   long-tailed ducks wintering on northeastern Lake Ontario.},

Abstract = {The Systems Approach Framework with an integrated
   Ecological-Social-Economic assessment was applied to address the issue
   of zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) farming in the large Oder
   (Szczecin) Lagoon, southern Baltic Sea. Heavy eutrophication hampers the
   use of the lagoon and zebra mussel farming is considered as new use and
   potential measure to improve water quality. Three alternative scenarios
   were developed in interaction with local stakeholders: 1) the production
   of mussels as fresh feed and meal on a commercial basis seemed not
   profitable, because of a limited market for fresh mussels (zoos,
   aquaculture) and low prices for organic feed. 2) Mussel cultivation to
   improve transparency and attractiveness of bathing waters near beaches
   had only a limited potential (0.2 m improvement of Secchi depth). A
   higher mussel biomass would increase the risk of temporary hypoxia. 3)
   Mussels farms for improving the environmental status (according to EU
   Water Framework Directive) by supporting macrophyte restoration were
   considered as the most promising scenario. Our model simulations
   suggested that as soon as a compensation for nutrient removal is
   considered, all mussel farm scenarios could cover the costs. Experiments
   and literature confirm that the conditions for an environmental friendly
   farming approach in the lagoon are suitable. Steps towards and problems
   associated with an implementation, e.g. invasion of Dreissena bugensis

Abstract = {We contrast ecological and life history traits of the well studied
   freshwater invader, the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha), with the
   lesser known invasive golden mussel (Limnoperna fortunei) to compare
   salient biological traits and environmental limits, and to predict the
   potential spread and ecosystem impacts of L.fortunei in areas where it
   is introduced. Both species are sessile, byssate bivalves with a
   planktonic larval stage and extremely high reproductive capacity. For
   both species adults attain much higher biomass in waterbodies they
   invade than all of the Dative invertebrates combined, and they create
   substrate complexity otherwise not found in freshwater systems. Both are
   very active suspension feeders, greatly enhance benthicpelagic coupling,
   and act as effective ecosystem engineers. Although taxonomically
   unrelated, their ecosystem impacts are surprisingly similar and follow
   from the novel ecological niche they share, rather than being species
   specific. The golden mussel has broader environmental tolerances and
   therefore may be a much more successful invader than D. polymorpha in
   regions dominated by acidic, soft and contaminated waters. In the near
   future L. fortunei may colonize the southern and central parts of North
   America, much farther north than has been previously predicted. Although
   to date the zebra mussel is considered the most aggressive freshwater
   invader, soon many waterbodies may receive another, even more aggressive
   invader.},

Abstract = {Biological invasions continue to accelerate, and there is a need for
   closer integration between invasive species research and on-the-ground
   management. In many regions, aquatic invasive species have established
   isolated populations, but have not yet spread to many sites that provide
   suitable habitat. In the Laurentian Great Lakes region, several Great
   Lakes invaders such as zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha), rainbow
   smelt (Osmerus mordax), and spiny water flea (Bythotrephes longimanus)
   are currently undergoing secondary spread to the smaller inland lakes
   and streams. This paper describes recent advances in forecasting the
   secondary spread of aquatic invasive species and presents a framework
   for assessing vulnerability of inland waters based on explicit
   assessment of three distinct aspects of biological invasions:
   colonization, site suitability, and adverse impact. In many cases, only
   a fraction of lakes on the landscape are vulnerable to specific invasive
   species, highlighting the potential application of this type of research
   for improving invasive species management. Effective application to
   on-the-ground resource management will require that research aimed at
   assessing site vulnerability be translated into management tools.},

Abstract = {The Asian clam Corbicula fluminea is among the most prolific aquatic
   invaders in the world; but in colder mid latitude areas, like the
   Laurentian Great Lakes, their population expansion has likely been
   limited by poor over winter survival. In these areas, Asian clams are
   typically found in thermal refugia like warmwater discharges from
   industrial facilities. We sought to identify the current extent of Asian
   clam populations in Lake Michigan and waters immediately adjacent to it,
   specifically at locations most likely to harbor overwintering
   populations - industrial warmwater discharges. During April-May 2017, we
   surveyed 17 locations around Lake Michigan. Evidence of Asian clam
   populations was found at four sites, though live specimens (n = 3) were
   only found at the Indiana Harbor Ship Canal in East Chicago, IN. Shells
   or fragments of shells were found at Green Bay, WI, Waukegan, IL, and
   Port Sheldon, MI. Our findings indicate that although Asian clams are
   present in Lake Michigan, they are relatively rare, and remain isolated
   to a few small pockets of over-wintering habitat. Published by Elsevier

Volume = {7},

Abstract = {Ecological risks and economical impacts of zebra mussels (Dreissena
   polyrnorpha) include alterations in the transfer of energy and cycling
   of materials in aquatic systems, increased accumulation of contaminants
   in aquatic food chains, clogging of water intakes, and damage to related
   infrastructure. A risk-based decision model was developed to assess the
   likelihood of zebra mussel invasion and establishment throughout the St.
   Croix Basin. The risk-based decision model CASM(ZM) is a version of the
   comprehensive aquatic systems model (CASM) and that was modified to
   simulate the growth, reproduction, and spatial distribution of zebra
   mussels. As a risk management tool, the model simulates the population
   dynamical complexity of zebra mussel populations, as well as their
   impacts on phytoplankton, zooplankton, benthic invertebrates, fish and
   natural mussel populations. The CASM(ZM) is based in part on a set of
   zebra mussel's physical-chemical habitat requirements such as calcium
   concentration (17 mg/L), total hardness (57.5 mg/L), conductivity (62 mu
   S/cm), dissolved oxygen concentration (6 mg/L), salinity (7 PSU), pH
   (6.8 and 9.4), Secchi disk depths (75 and 205 cm), and water
   temperatures for growth (14 degrees C) and reproduction (30 degrees C).
   The CASM(ZM) also includes a bioenergetics framework that describes the
   growth of zebra mussels and their trophic impacts on aquatic food webs.
   The CASM(ZM) can be used to forecast the risk of successful dreissenid
   invasions and assess the associated impacts of invasive mussels on food
   web dynamics of previously uninfested aquatic systems throughout the St.
   Croix Basin. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {27},

Pages = {230-238},
Abstract = {The demography of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) and its
   impacts on native fingernail clams (Sphaeriidae) in Lake Michigan near
   Michigan City, Indiana were studied from 1992 to 1997 at 5, 10, and 15 m
   depths. Zebra mussel densities ranged from 0 to 6,209/m(,)(2) and were
   greatest at deeper stations. Size-frequency distributions suggest that
   initial colonization of the Michigan City area occurred in 1991, with
   adults typically living for 2 to 3 years. Abundance of adult populations
   may be limited by the sandy habitat typical of the areas studied and the
   occasional high-energy wave action in the shallow (5 m) near-shore zone
   of this area. Densities of fingernail clam ranged from 0 to 1,312/m(2)
   and were also greatest at deeper stations. Approximately half of the
   fingernail clams shells between 1 and 2 mm in size were used as
   substrate for attachment by juvenile and adult zebra mussels, while over
   90\% of the clams > 2 mm showed attachment by zebra mussels. Overall
   median densities of Sphaeriidae decreased from 832/m(2) to 13/m(2) at
   the 15 m depth and from 234/m(2) to 0/m(2) at the 10 m depth during the
   study. It appears that zebra mussel colonization caused a dramatic
   reduction of Sphaeriidae density by 1997 that may eventually result in
   their loss from the area.},

Organization = {Amer Soc Zoologists},
Abstract = {The zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas), was introduced into
   North America in 1986. Initial North American (N.A.) studies suggested
   that physiological responses varied between N.A. and European
   populations. However, literature review indicates agreement on most
   aspects of physiological adaptation including: respiratory responses;
   hypoxia/anoxia tolerance; salinity limits; emersion tolerance; freezing
   resistance; environmental pH limits; calcium limits; starvation
   responses; and bioenergetic partitioning. The main differences among
   N.A. and European mussels appear to be elevated upper thermal limits and
   temperatures for optimum growth among N.A. populations. N.A. zebra
   mussels probably originated from the northern shore of the Black Sea in
   the warmest portion of the mussel's European range. However, most
   European physiological data come from northern Europe where populations
   may be adapted to colder temperatures. Alternatively, N.A. research
   suggests that mussels may have a capacity for seasonal temperature
   acclimatization such that responses recorded in wanner N.A. waters may
   be different from those recorded in northern Europe even after
   short-term laboratory acclimation. Studies of genetic variation and
   physiological response among European and N.A. D. polymorpha populations
   are required to elucidate the basis for physiological differentiation.
   Recently evolved D. polymorpha has poor resistance adaptations compared
   to unionacean and sphaeriid bivalves with longer freshwater fossil
   histories. Poor resistance adaptations make it less suited for stable
   habitats, instead, its high fecundities, early maturity, and rapid
   growth are adaptations to unstable habitats where extensive resistance
   adaptations are of little value.},

Abstract = {We evaluated long-term fisheries data relative to a range of
   perturbations for the Arkansas River from 1970 to 2006. Rotenone sample
   sites were located at pool 1,9 (Garrison Creek), Ozark Lake (Lavaca),
   and Lake Dardanelle (Panther Cove and the Arkansas Nuclear I Effluent
   Bay). The period of record was 24 years for Garrison Creek and Lavaca,
   29 years for Effluent Bay, and so years for Panther Cove. Mean total
   fish biomass ranged between 466 kg/ha and 1,601 kg/ha among sites, and
   no temporal trends were detected for total biomass. Invasion of zebra
   mussels Dreissena polymorpha, discovery of largemouth bass virus, and
   imposition of a 381 mm total length (TL) minimum length limit for
   largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides likely contributed to notable
   changes in these fisheries during the past 30 years. Biomass of redear
   sunfish Lepomis microlophus, freshwater drum Aplodinotus grunniens, and
   blue catfish Ictalurus furcatus increased in association with the
   invasion of the river by normative zebra mussels. Spotted gar
   Lepisosteus oculatus and paddlefish Polyodon spathula biomass increased,
   and common carp Cyprinus carpio biomass declined coincident with the
   zebra Mussel invasion. Large-scale sedimentation of aquatic habitats may
   have been related to observed declines of backwater-oriented species,
   especially common carp and spotted gar. The frequency bass between 350
   and 4.00 mm TL increased in electrofishing samples after the imposition
   of a 381-mm-TL minimum length limit, and total catch per hour of
   largemouth bass greater than 38 1 mm TL increased. Our associations
   would suggest that the discovery of largemouth bass virus during 2000
   contributed to (1) lower electrofishing catch per hour of largemouth
   bass greater than 533 mm TL, and (2) an average increase of 420 h
   required for an angler to catch a 2.2-7-kg largemouth bass. We
   anticipate further changes in the Arkansas River during the next decade
   from the biological invasions of white perch Morone americana, bighead
   carp Hypophthalmichthys nobilis, and silver carp H. molitrix; increased
   establishment of aquatic vegetation; and accelerated loss of aquatic
   habitats associated with planned federal navigation channel
   improvements.},

Abstract = {Phytoplankton and Microcystis aeruginosa (Kutz.) Kutz. biovolumes were
   characterized and modeled, respectively, with regard to hydrological and
   meteorological variables during zebra mussel invasion in Saginaw Bay
   (1990-1996). Total phytoplankton and Microcystis biomass within the
   inner bay were one and one-half and six times greater, respectively,
   than those of the outer bay. Following mussel invasion, mean total
   biomass in the inner bay decreased 84\% but then returned to its
   approximate initial value. Microcystis was not present in the bay during
   1990 and 1991 and thereafter occurred at/in 52\% of sample sites/dates
   with the greatest biomass occurring in 1994-1996 and within months
   having water temperatures >19 degrees C. With an overall relative
   biomass of 0.03 +/- 0.01 (mean + SE), Microcystis had, at best, a
   marginal impact upon holistic compositional dynamics. Dynamics of the
   centric diatom Cyclotella ocellata Pant. and large pennate diatoms
   dominated compositional dissimilarities both inter-and intra-annually.
   The environmental variables that corresponded with phytoplankton
   distributions were similar for the inner and outer bays, and together
   identified physical forcing and biotic utilization of nutrients as
   determinants of system-level biomass patterns. Nonparametric models
   explained 70\%-85\% of the variability in Microcystis biovolumes and
   identified maximal biomass to occur at total phosphorus (TP)
   concentrations ranging from 40 to 45 mu g . L-1. From isometric
   projections depicting modeled Microcystis/environmental interactions, a
   TP concentration of <30 mu g . L-1 was identified as a desirable
   contemporary ``target{''} for management efforts to ameliorate bloom
   potentials throughout mussel-impacted bay waters.},

Title = {Evidence for remote effects of dreissenid mussels on the amphipod

Abstract = {The status of invasive dreissenid mussels (Dreissena polymorpha and D.
   bugensis) and native amphipods (Diporeia spp.) in Lake Ontario was
   assessed in 2003 and compared with historical data. D. polymorpha (zebra
   mussels) were rarely observed in 2003, having been displaced by D.
   bugensis (quagga mussels). D. bugensis expanded its depth range from 38
   m depth in 1995 to 174 m in 2003 and this dreissenid reached densities
   averaging 8,000/m(2) at all sites < 90 m. During the same time period,
   Diporeia populations almost completely disappeared from 0-90 m depth,
   continuing a declining trend from 1994-1997 reported in previous
   studies. The average density of Diporeia in the 30-90 m depth interval
   decreased from 1,380/m(2) to 63/m(2) between 1997 and 2003. Prior to
   2003, areas deeper than 90 m represented a refuge for Diporeia, but even
   these deep populations decreased, with densities declining from
   2,181/m(2) in 1999 to 545/m(2) in 2003. Two common hypotheses for the
   decline of Diporeia in the Great Lakes are food limitation and a
   toxin/pathogen associated with dreissenid pseudofeces. The Diporeia
   decline in deep waters preceded the expansion of D. bugensis to these
   depths, and suggests that shallow dreissenid populations remotely
   influence profundal habitats. This pattern of decline is consistent with
   mechanisms that act from some distance including nearshore dreissenid
   grazing and downslope transport of pseudofeces.},

Abstract = {The zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) provides one example of
   successful invaders in novel environments. However, little attention has
   been devoted to exploring the factors regulating zebra mussel density
   and population size structure at the local scale. We tested effects of
   physicochemical factors and fish predation on the density of zebra
   mussels at several sites and between years in a natural lake. Water
   depth and roach (Rutilus rutilus) density were the most important
   variables affecting local zebra mussel density. Substrate was also an
   important factor but affected Dreissena density only at the shallowest
   depth examined (2 m), which also supported a large population of the
   mussels. Mean shell length of Dreissena increased with water depth. Our
   results indicate that predation pressure, intraspecific competition, and
   food limitation might be responsible for variation in zebra mussel
   density and population size structure in space and time and that fish
   predation might have strong top-down effects on zebra mussel
   populations.},

Title = {Predicting the impacts of an introduced species from its invasion
   history: an empirical approach applied to zebra mussel invasions},
Journal = {FRESHWATER BIOLOGY},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {48},
Number = {6},
Pages = {972-981},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {1. Quantitative models of impact are lacking for the vast majority of
   known invasive species, particularly in aquatic ecosystems.
   Consequently, managers lack predictive tools to help them prioritise
   invasion threats and decide where they can most effectively allocate
   limited resources. Predictive tools would also enhance the accuracy of
   water quality assessments, so that impacts caused by an invader are not
   erroneously attributed to other anthropogenic stressors.
   2. The invasion history of a species is a valuable guide for predicting
   the consequences of its introduction into a new environment. Regression
   analysis of data from multiple invaded sites can generate empirical
   models of impact, as is shown here for the zebra mussel Dreissena
   polymorpha. Dreissena's impacts on benthic invertebrate abundance and
   diversity follow predictable patterns that are robust across a range of
   habitat types and geographic regions. Similar empirical models could be
   developed for other invaders with a documented invasion history.
   3. Because an invader's impact is correlated with its abundance, a
   surrogate model may be generated ( when impact data are unavailable) by
   relating the invader's abundance to environmental variables. Such a
   model could help anticipate which habitats will be most affected by
   invasion. Lack of precision should not be a deterrent to developing
   predictive models where none exist. Crude predictions can be refined as
   additional data become available. Empirical modelling is a highly
   informative and inexpensive, but underused, approach in the management
   of aquatic invasive species.},

Abstract = {Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) are an aquatic invasive species
   that plague much of North America and are difficult to impossible to
   eradicate once they become established. Therefore, prevention and
   monitoring are key elements in the control of these organisms.
   Traditional microscopy is commonly used in monitoring but requires the
   presence of larval veligers. This limits the times when resource
   managers can monitor for the presence in northern lakes. A new
   monitoring tool, environmental DNA (eDNA), may allow for a more
   efficient and cost-effective monitoring program for zebra mussels. We
   developed and tested an environmental DNA assay in the fall and spring
   for zebra mussels in two Minnesota lakes, one heavily infested and
   another newly infested. We found that DNA copy numbers tended to be
   higher near the lake bottom and DNA was more concentrated in softer
   substrates. We also found that the amount of zebra mussel DNA sampling
   in winter resulted in similar results to when sampled in fall. This
   suggests that one could collect and analyze eDNA for zebra mussels
   during winter months to help inform future efforts in monitoring and
   control.},

Title = {Predicting introduction, establishment and potential impacts of
   smallmouth bass},
Journal = {DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {15},
Number = {5},
Pages = {831-840},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Aim
   The introduction of non-indigenous species has resulted in wide-ranging
   ecological and economic impacts. Predictive modelling of the
   introduction and establishment of non-indigenous species is imperative
   to identify areas at high risk of invasion to effectively manage
   non-indigenous species and conserve native populations. Smallmouth bass
   (Micropterus dolomieu), a warm water fish species native to central
   North America has negatively impacted native fish communities, including
   cyprinids and salmonid populations, as a result of intentional
   introductions. We predicted the introduction risk; species establishment
   based on habitat suitability; identified lakes at high risk of invasion;
   and finally assessed the consequential impacts on native salmon, trout
   and cyprinid populations.
   Location
   Ontario and British Columbia, Canada.
   Methods
   Classification tree and logistic regression models were developed and
   validated to predict the introduction and establishment of smallmouth
   bass for thousands of lakes.
   Results
   Densely human populated areas and larger lake surface areas successfully
   identify lakes associated with the introduction of smallmouth bass
   (introduction model) in British Columbia. Climate, lake morphology and
   water chemistry variables were the driving environmental parameters to
   define suitable smallmouth bass habitat (establishment model). A
   combination of the introduction and establishment model identified 138
   lakes that are currently at risk in British Columbia to the introduction
   and establishment of smallmouth bass. Of these 138 high-risk lakes, 95\%
   of them contain at least one species of salmon, trout or cyprinid,
   thereby increasing the potential impact of an invasion by smallmouth
   bass.
   Main conclusions
   Our framework can be applied to other terrestrial and aquatic species to
   obtain a better understanding of the potential risk posed by a
   non-indigenous species to an ecosystem. Furthermore, our methodology can
   be used to focus management efforts on areas at higher risk (e.g. number
   of potential releases, more favourable habitats) to control future
   introductions of non-indigenous species, thereby conserving native
   populations.},

Abstract = {Biofoulers accumulate on underwater surfaces and adversely affect human
   activities and infrastructure. Freshwater biofoulers are much less
   well-known than their marine counterparts but can be economically
   important: we estimate the potential global cost of freshwater
   biofouling to be similar to US\$277 million per year. They include
   several groups of organisms, all of which have the potential to be
   ecosystem engineers with strong effects on the physical and chemical
   properties of freshwater habitats. Nevertheless, ecological and economic
   research on freshwater biofoulers has been limited. We predict that
   freshwater biofouling will become worse in the future as a result of
   human activities, such as anthropogenic introductions of exotic species,
   eutrophication, construction of artificial habitats, and climate change.
   Increasing demand for energy and water may raise the costs associated
   with freshwater biofouling prevention and damage repair. More research
   and better policies and technologies are needed to prevent escalation of
   biofouler impacts and their related costs.},

Abstract = {Native unionid mussel populations have recently declined throughout
   North America as a result of zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha)
   fouling. Periodic cleaning of fouled unionids and cleaning followed by
   translocation have been suggested as methods for reducing mortality.
   Leptodea fragilis and Potamilus alatus were used to determine survival,
   recovery of energetic stores, and accumulation of newly settled zebra
   mussels after cleaning and replacement in situ. Both species had high
   survival, and L. fragilis increased energetic stores after cleaning.
   Elliptio complanata and Lampsilis radiata were used to compare
   conservation strategies for unionids fouled by zebra mussels. Survival
   and glycogen content were used to evaluate stress induced by cleaning
   and replacement in situ, cleaning and translocation, and cleaning,
   quarantine, and translocation, relative to the stress in fouled unionids
   and control (never fouled) unionids. New zebra mussel settlement was
   assessed to estimate the frequency of cleanings needed. Cleaned E.
   complanata and L. radiata maintained significantly higher glycogen
   levels and had higher survival than fouled unionids in all treatments;
   however, 30\% of L. radiata died while in quarantine but no E.
   complanata died. Translocated unionids were difficult to relocate in the
   riverine refugium The inability to find translocated unionids, coupled
   with high survival and energetic stores in cleaned and replaced
   unionids, indicate that cleaning and replacement is an effective
   conservation strategy. Cleaning and replacement may be used as the Ist
   step to conserve small populations of fouled unionids Living in
   environments where food is not Limiting and where collection and
   cleaning are logistically feasible.},

Volume = {495},

Abstract = {We conducted a factorial experiment, in outdoor mesocosms, on the
   effects of zebra mussels and water column mixing (i.e., turbulence) on
   the diet, growth, and survival of larval fathead minnows (Pimephales
   promelas). Significant (P < 0.05) larval mortality occurred by the end
   of the experiment with the highest mortality (90\%) occurring in the
   presence of both turbulence and zebra mussels, whereas mortality was
   37\% in treatment with turbulence and 17\% and 18\% in the zebra mussels
   treatment, and the control, respectively. The size of individual fish
   was significantly different among treatments at the end of the
   experiment and was inversely related to survival. Levels of trophic
   resources (i.e., phyto and zooplankton) varied among treatments and were
   treatment specific. Turbulent mixing facilitated removal of
   phytoplankton by zebra mussels by making the entire water column of the
   tanks available to these benthic filter feeders. Early in the experiment
   (Day = 0 to 14) the physical process of turbulent mixing likely caused a
   reduction in standing stocks of zooplankton. The interactive effect of
   turbulence and mussels reduced copepod and rotifer stocks, through
   physical processes and through filtration by zebra mussels, relative to
   the turbulence treatment. The reductions in the number of total
   zooplankton in the turbulent mixing mesocosms and the further reduction
   of rotifer and copepod in the turbulence and mussels treatment coincided
   with a period of increased reliance of larval fathead minnows on these
   prey. Estimates of consumption from bioenergetics modeling and measured
   prey standing stocks indicated caloric resources of suitable prey in
   turbulence treatments during the early weeks of the experiment were
   insufficient to prevent starvation. Early mortality in the turbulence
   and mussels treatment likely released surviving fish from intense
   intraspecific competition and resulted in higher individual growth
   rates. A combination of high abundance of zebra mussels in an
   environment with a well-mixed water column can have significant effects
   on larval fish survival and growth.},

Abstract = {The rapid spread of the exotic zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha)
   concerns aquatic resource managers in the United States and Canada.
   Since 1990, it has been spreading from the Great Lakes into the
   Northeast. The zebra mussel cannot colonize equally in northeastern
   lakes in part because soft water causes ion exchange and reproductive
   problems when {[}Ca2+] reaches a lower limit of approximately 12 mg/L,
   and pH drops below 7.3. We used (1) an alkalinity map to conservatively
   delineate areas expected to be at low risk for zebra mussel invasion and
   (2) water chemistry data from 344 lakes sampled in the 1991-1994
   Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) to estimate
   numbers and surface area of lakes at risk in the Northeast (New England,
   New York, and New Jersey). These lakes were randomly selected from a
   target population of 11,080 lakes > 1 and < 10,000 ha using a
   probability design that allowed inference to all lakes in the. region
   with known confidence. An estimated 25\% (2,770 SE = 410) of lakes in
   the Northeast have {[}Ca2+] > 12 mg/L and could potentially support
   zebra mussel. An estimated 80\% of lakes in high alkalinity areas are at
   risk, while only 5\% of lakes in low alkalinity areas have {[}Ca2+] > 12
   mg/L. The alkalinity map adequately segregated low- and high-calcium
   lakes. State resource managers can use this information to better
   allocate control, monitoring, and education resources.},

Title = {Impacts of dreissenid mussel invasions on chlorophyll and total

Journal = {FRESHWATER BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {58},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {1. Invasions of zebra and quagga mussels have had long-term, large-scale
   impacts on lake ecosystems in the USA as characterised by high
   abundance, broad-scale spread and effective adaption to new
   environmental conditions. Due to their high filtering capacity,
   decreases in chlorophyll a (Chl) and total phosphorus (TP)
   concentrations have been reported in many affected lakes. 2. In 25 US
   lakes, we analysed the effects of dreissenid invasions on changes in Chl
   and TP concentrations, measured as the probability of a concentration
   decrease in the post-invasion period and changes in ChlTP relationships
   using Bayesian hierarchical regressions. We also examined whether
   changes in Chl and TP concentrations and in the ChlTP relationship
   differed according to lake hydromorphology, such as mean depth or mixing
   status (mixed versus stratified lakes). 3. Our results showed that
   dreissenid invasions were often, but not always, associated with
   subsequent TP and Chl declines. Dreissenid effects on Chl and TP may be
   influenced by lake thermal structure. Decreases in Chl and TP were
   consistently found in mixed lakes where benthicpelagic coupling is
   tight, while the effects were less predictable in stratified lakes.
   Within stratified lakes, Chl and TP reductions were more clearly
   discernible in deeper lakes with long water residence times. 4.
   Regression results demonstrated that a joint increase in slope and
   decrease in intercept and a tighter correlation of the ChlTP
   relationship were likely to occur in dreissenid-invaded lakes; this does
   not support the idea of a shift from bottom-up to top-down control of
   primary production. These results have important implications for
   management, suggesting that a relaxation of TP standards would be
   unwarranted. 5. Across lakes, the slope of the ChlTP relationship for
   mixed lakes was substantially higher than that for stratified lakes
   before mussel invasion, indicating an important role of light in
   limiting primary production. The slope differences between mixed and
   stratified lakes decreased in the post-invasion period, possibly because
   mussel filtration results in a relaxation of light limitation that is
   more pronounced in deeper, stratified lakes.},

Title = {Feasting in fresh water: impacts of food concentration on freshwater

Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {6},
Number = {4},
Pages = {673-689},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Saline to freshwater invasions have become increasingly common in recent
   years. A key hypothesis is that rates of freshwater invasions have been
   amplified in recent years by increased food concentration, yet this
   hypothesis has remained unexplored. We examined whether elevated food
   concentration could enhance freshwater tolerance, and whether this
   effect evolves following saline to freshwater invasions. We examined
   physiological response to salinity and food concentration in a 2x2
   factorial design, using ancestral brackish and freshwater invading
   populations of the copepod Eurytemora affinis. We found that high food
   concentration significantly increases low-salinity tolerance. This
   effect was reduced in the freshwater population, indicating evolution
   following the freshwater invasion. Thus, ample food could enable
   freshwater invasions, allowing subsequent evolution of low-salinity
   tolerance even under food-poor conditions. We also compared effects of
   food concentration on freshwater survival between two brackish
   populations from the native range. Impacts of food concentration on
   freshwater survival differed between the brackish populations,
   suggesting variation in functional properties affecting their propensity
   to invade freshwater habitats. The key implication is that high food
   concentration could profoundly extend range expansions of brackishwater
   species into freshwater habitats, potentially allowing for
   condition-specific competition between saline invaders and resident
   freshwater species.},

Volume = {10},

Abstract = {In regions with abundant and diverse freshwater resources, it is
   difficult and costly to survey all lakes at the level required to detect
   invasive plants. Effective allocation of monitoring resources requires
   tools that identify waterbodies where exotic species are most likely to
   invade. We developed and tested models that predict conditions in which
   Eurasian watermilfoil, Myriophyllum spicatum, is most likely to survive
   and successfully colonize. We used logistic regression to model the
   likelihood of M. spicatum presence or absence using a suite of
   biological, chemical, and physical lake characteristics which are easily
   obtainable from public databases. We evaluated model fit by the Aikake
   criterion and model performance by the percentage of misclassification
   errors as well as the costs associated with acquiring data for variables
   modeled. Several models fit our data well, misclassifying only
   1.3-11.0\% of the lakes where M. spicatum was observed, and used
   relatively inexpensive landscape variables (percent forest cover in a
   drainage basin, presence and type of public boat launch, and bedrock
   type) that typically exist as information layers in geographic
   information systems (GISs) or recreational atlases. We found that the
   most important factors affecting the presence or absence of M. spicatum
   were those that influence water quality factors known to impact M.
   spicatum growth, rather than factors associated with human activity and
   dispersal potential. In particular, the amount of forest cover in the
   lake watershed was consistently important and could control the level of
   dissolved inorganic carbon in lakes, one of the factors known to affect
   M. spicatum growth rates. Factors such as the number of game fish
   species and number and types of boat ramps or proximity to roads were
   generally less important lake characteristics. Our models can be useful
   tools for developing management strategies to prevent or slow the spread
   of M. spicatum and aquatic invaders, such as the zebra mussel, that can
   attach to it and thus be dispersed. Our models also exemplify a general
   approach for slowing or stopping the spread of other invading species.},

Title = {The ShearStress importance on the spatial distribution pattern of the
   invader Limnoperna fortunei in the Upper Parana River Basin. - An
   assessment based on the Spatial Distribution Models},

Abstract = {The introduction of the golden mussel, Limnoperna fortunei (Dunker,
   1857) in South America was related to the discharge of ballast water,
   with its first record in 1991 in the La Plata River estuary. Since then,
   the species is spreading throughout the continent, with several economic
   and ecological negative consequences.
   Aim: To model, in the headwaters of Parana River, the spatial
   distribution of L. fortunei and to understand the determinants of the
   current pattern of species distribution and the risk of invasion of
   areas not yet colonized.
   Methods: The ecological niche of L. fortunei was modeled using the
   algorithm MAXENT (Maximum Entropy Method) combined with records of
   occurrence of the bivalve, limnological data and the shear force
   measured by the index Hack (SL). The evaluation of the performance of
   different models was based on AUC (Area Under the Curve). The analysis
   of each variable's contribution to the responses of the models was made
   based on the Jackknife test, available in the Maxent program. The models
   were validated with real absence data collected between 2006 and 2007.
   Based on the limnological characterization of the area and on outputs of
   the models, this analysis sought to understand the contributing aspects
   to the current and potential spatial distribution and to verify the risk
   of invasion of environments not yet colonized by the species.
   Results/Conclusion: The limnological characterization showed that the
   ecological requirements for the species as, pH, calcium, oxygen and
   chlorophyll a, were appropriate in both the connected stretches, invaded
   and non-invaded. Turbidity showed significant spatial differences which
   proved to be higher in environments with higher levels of Hack (SL),
   i.e. higher energy fluvial. In addition, the algorithm showed the
   importance of hydrodynamical aspects expressed by Hack index (SL) to the
   spatial distribution of species, since the models with the best
   performances were those that considered the Hack index (SL) as one of
   the environmental layers of the mussel's niche. All models indicated a
   high risk of invasion into the reservoir of Sao Simao.},

Abstract = {The continuous spread of invasive alien species, as zebra mussel
   (Dreissena polymorpha), is a major global concern and it is urgent to
   stop it. Early stages of an invasion are crucial and challenging;
   however, detection tools based on environmental DNA analysis are
   promising alternatives. We present an alternative DNA target
   amplification strategy for signal enhancement followed by dual-mode
   colorimetric naked eye and optical smartphone analysis for the early
   detection of zebra mussel environmental DNA. Target amplification was
   designed based on the nicking endonuclease probe cleavage upon probe and
   complementary target hybridization. The cleaved/intact probe interacts
   with DNA-modified nanoparticles for colorimetric detection. We have
   demonstrated that enzyme amplification strategy enhanced 12-fold the
   sensitivity by naked eye detection, achieving a detection limit of
   similar to 8 nM (4.48x10(10) copies) in controlled conditions, whereas
   target in complex environmental samples allowed the detection of 22.5 nM
   (1.26x10(11) copies). Competitive assays also showed that the system can
   discriminate specific zebra mussel DNA sequences from other DNA
   sequences. Additionally, smartphone analysis for DNA quantification
   further improved the sensitivity of its detection by 130-fold, more than
   2 orders of magnitude, when applied to environmental samples. The limit
   of detection to 0.17 nM (9.52x10(8) copies) is based on RGB coordinates,
   which is especially relevant to monitor early aggregation stages, being
   more accurate and reducing naked eye detection subjectivity. DNA
   extracted from zebra mussel meat, zebra mussel contaminated river water,
   and non-contaminated river water samples were successfully tested.
   Dual-mode colorimetric detection is useful in field analysis without the
   need for expensive laboratory equipment.},

Abstract = {The introduction of invasive species that can replace native species is
   one of the most critical threats to the biodiversity of aquatic systems.
   Here we investigated the potential contribution of one factor to the
   coexistence of the indigenous amphipod Gammarus roeselii and the
   invasive amphipod Dikerogammarus villosus in the same ecosystem (Lake
   Constance) within different microhabitats. We quantitatively studied the
   influence of ambient ammonia concentrations on the distributions of the
   two amphipod species. We also assessed the ammonia tolerance ranges of
   both species in laboratory experiments by measuring mortality rate,
   precopula disruption, egg mortality, and microhabitat choice. The
   proportion of G. roeselii among the two amphipod species was
   significantly positively related to the ammonia concentration in the
   water, which indicated that the distribution of the invasive D. villosus
   was limited at high ammonia concentrations. Although the mortality rates
   of the two species did not significantly differ, G. roeselii was more
   tolerant to ammonia with regard to precopula disruption, egg mortality,
   and microhabitat choice. The effective ammonia concentrations that led
   to a significantly reduced direct reproductive success in D. villosus
   were within the range of the highest field concentrations measured,
   where only G. roeselii occurred. D. villosus may have a smaller range
   than the indigenous G. roeselii partially because of its lower tolerance
   to higher ammonia concentrations, which lead to reduced reproductive
   success. Beside other habitat parameters differences on ammonia
   tolerance between the two amphipods might allow their coexistence along
   a gradient of microhabitats in Lake Constance.},

Abstract = {In June 2017, the invasion of an alien species Dreissena polymorpha was
   recorded in one of the quarries located in the Lake Ladoga basin (the

   the population and the trace element composition in shells of the
   mollusks were studied. It is found that the population is young with a
   high potential for further development under favorable environmental
   conditions. One of the prerequisites for invasion of the species into
   the water body is a high water mineralization, which provides an optimum
   level of elements necessary for the construction of a calcareous
   skeleton of a large number of specimens. The main chorological types
   formed by zebra mussels are brushes and druses which allow the maximum
   use of food resources in a limited space. The role of shells in
   accumulation and bio-burial of some trace elements is shown.},

Abstract = {Temperature, salinity, and aerial exposure tolerances of the invasive
   green mussel, Perna viridis, were investigated under environmentally
   realistic conditions to address potential competition with native
   oysters, Crassostrea virginica. This study demonstrated that green
   mussels exhibit a temperature tolerance range similar to that of its
   native range (13-30 A degrees C), thereby limiting northern spread of
   south Florida populations. Salinity tolerances as low as 6 were observed
   during gradual decreases; however, acute changes resulted in low
   survival at salinities of 15 and below. At low salinities, even when
   survival was high, reductions in normal behavior (byssal production and
   valve closure) were observed. Green mussel survival was significantly
   inhibited during aerial exposure across all temperatures, and mortality
   synergistically increased (60-80 \%) with increasing temperatures and
   exposure time. In contrast, oysters demonstrated a parts per thousand
   yen97 \% survival over the exposure period at similar internal
   temperatures observed in green mussels. Internal temperatures for both
   species frequently exceeded 33 A degrees C, reaching temperatures as
   high as 41 A degrees C, while air temperatures averaged only 26.4 A +/-
   1.6 A degrees C. Our results suggest that while Florida green mussel
   populations exhibit relatively broad temperature and salinity ranges,
   their spread is limited by the available subtidal habitat, potentially
   sparing intertidal oyster reefs from habitat and nutrient competition.},

Title = {Priority setting for invasive species management: risk assessment of
   Ponto-Caspian invasive species into Great Britain},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {23},
Number = {2},
Pages = {352-364},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Invasive species drive important ecological and economic losses across
   wide geographies, with some regions supporting especially large numbers
   of nonnative species and consequently suffering relatively high impacts.
   For this reason, integrated risk assessments able to screen a suite of
   multiple invaders over large geographic areas are needed for
   prioritizing the allocation of limited resources. A total of 16
   Ponto-Caspian aquatic species (10 gammarids, one isopod, two mysids, and
   three fishes) have been short-listed as recent or potential future
   invaders of British waters, whose introduction and spread is of high
   concern. In this study, we use multiple modeling techniques to assess
   their risk of establishment and spread into Great Britain. Climate
   suitability maps for these 16 species differed depending on the eastern
   and western distribution of species in continental Europe, which was
   related to their respective migration corridor: southern (Danube-Rhine
   rivers), and northern (Don and Volga rivers and Baltic lakes). Species
   whose suitability was high across large parts of Great Britain included
   four gammarids (Cheliorophium robustum, Dikerogammarus bispinosus, D.
   villosus, and Echinogammarus trichiatus) and a mysid (Hemimysis
   anomala). A climatic ``{''}heat map{''} combining the results of all 16
   species together pointed to the southeast of England as the area most
   vulnerable to multiple invasions, particularly the Thames, Anglian,
   Severn, and Humber river basin districts. Regression models further
   suggested that alkalinity concentration >120 mg/L in southeast England
   may favor the establishment of Ponto-Caspian invaders. The production of
   integrated risk maps for future invaders provides a means for the
   scientifically informed prioritization of resources toward particular
   species and geographic regions. Such tools have great utility in helping
   environmental managers focus efforts on the most effective prevention,
   management, and monitoring programs.},

Title = {Effects of water depth on survival, condition and stable isotope values
   of three invasive dreissenid species in a deep freshwater lake},

Abstract = {To examine the effects of depth on the performance of the freshwater
   dreissenid species Dreissena polymorpha and D. rostriformis bugensis,
   and the brackish water dreissenid, Mytilopsis leucophaeata, a controlled
   experiment lasting four months was conducted in a manmade freshwater
   lake in the Netherlands. The three species used in the experiment were
   collected from other water bodies in the Netherlands. Cages containing
   each species in separate compartments were placed at water depths of 2,
   5, 10 and 17 m from November 2009 until February 2010. Samples of
   individuals were retrieved at the start and at approximately four-week
   incubation intervals, for determination of overall survival, condition
   and soft tissue carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios. In contrast
   to the Dreissena species, survival of M. leucophaeata decreased strongly
   over time at each depth. Mortality increased with increasing depth and
   was greatest at 17 m. Survival of D. polymorpha at 17 m was much greater
   than that of D. rostriformis bugensis. The condition of all species
   after 3.5 weeks did not differ significantly from that at the start.
   Surviving M. leucophaeata showed a significantly reduced condition at
   all depths after 16 weeks. Both Dreissena species showed an improved
   condition at depths of 2, 5 and 10 m after 16 weeks, the greatest
   improvement being found at 2 m. After 16 weeks at 17 m, both Dreissena
   species had the lowest condition index. Stable isotope ratios of soft
   tissue for both Dreissena species showed a shift in delta N-15 within
   3.5 weeks. The delta N-15 values of mussels held at 2-10 m fell. Those
   held at 17 m had values similar to that initially recorded, possibly
   indicative of very limited food intake at that depth or a diet similar
   to that at their location of origin. After 16 weeks, delta C-13 values
   became more negative than those at the start, in particular at 2 m. The
   stable isotope ratios of soft tissue of M. leucophaeata did not change
   at any depth throughout the experiment, possibly indicating lack of
   feeding in the freshwater lake. Changes in stable isotope values for
   both Dreissena species were reduced at 17 m. Mortality of D. polymorpha
   was lower at 17 m compared to the other two dreissenid species which
   indicated greater tolerance of habitat conditions a this deeper depth.},

Title = {Happy together? Avoidance of conspecifics by gregarious mussels},
Journal = {CURRENT ZOOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {64},
Number = {1},
Pages = {53-61},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha is a Ponto-Caspian species invasive in
   Europe and North America, with great environmental impact. It lives
   byssally attached to hard substrata in large aggregations, which is
   often explained by its preferences for conspecifics, though direct
   evidence for such preferences has been rather limited so far. We studied
   the reactions of zebra mussels to conspecifics, hypothesizing that they
   may either be attracted to one another or form aggregations only in the
   absence of alternative attachment sites. In Experiment 1, we tested
   mussel tendency to detach from existing druses depending on druse size
   (2-25 individuals) and substratum type (soft: sand; hard: glass).
   Mussels detached significantly more often on the hard substratum and
   from larger druses compared to soft substratum and smaller druses,
   respectively. This indicates that mussels tended to avoid conspecifics
   at high density, particularly when alternative substratum was available.
   In Experiment 2, we tested the responses of single mussels to distant (3
   or 15 cm) conspecifics (0, 3, 15 individuals per 2.5 l tank) on the
   sandy substratum. The presence of conspecifics, regardless of their
   distance and density, resulted in single unattached mussels staying more
   often in their initial positions. Mussels did not move preferentially
   towards or away from the conspecifics. Thus, even on unsuitable
   substratum mussels were not attracted by conspecifics and probably
   exhibited an avoidance reaction by reducing their movement. This
   suggests that dense mussel aggregations are formed due to the lack of
   available alternative attachment sites rather than due to their
   preferences for conspecifics.},

Title = {Interrelations between Dreissena polymorpha colonization and autotrophic

Journal = {FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {183},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Temporal changes in autotrophic periphyton (algae and cyanobacteria) in
   relation to the colonization of Dreissena polymorpha, an invasive
   species, were investigated in situ using artificial substrata (glass
   slides) from April to August of 2008 in a Danubian floodplain. The
   colonization of cyanobacteria and planktonic diatoms firmly attached to
   the substrata followed by the development of apical pad forming diatoms
   and stalk forming diatoms, resulted in the rapid formation of a
   three-dimensional structure of periphyton. Increasing water
   temperatures, together with the well developed autotrophic periphyton,
   supported the colonization of Dreissena. A total of 16 size classes of
   Dreissena were found during the gradual mussel community development.
   The community most likely formed from the initially settled larvae which
   dominated the first period of aggregation, while adult individuals
   dominated the later phase, contributing to the increase in habitat
   complexity. High competition for space and nutrients on small-size
   substrata limited the autotrophic periphyton to achieve the ``climax
   community{''}characterized by filamentous green algae. Consequently,
   algal abundance decreased and diatoms firmly attached to the substrata
   prevailed. The decrease in mussel abundance at the end of the
   colonization experiment enabled a gradual increase in diatom abundance
   and redevelopment of a three-dimensional autotrophic periphyton
   structure. Altogether, our results showed that dense coverage of hard
   surfaces by mussels may have negatively influenced the algal community
   causing a significant decrease in algal abundance and a shift to the
   dominance of species resistant to the disturbance.},

Title = {A Probability Co-Kriging Model to Account for Reporting Bias and
   Recognize Areas at High Risk for Zebra Mussels and Eurasian Watermilfoil
   Invasions in Minnesota},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {4},
Month = {JAN 4},
Abstract = {Zebra mussels (ZMs) (Dreissena polymorpha) and Eurasian watermilfoil
   (EWM) (Myriophyllum spicatum) are aggressive aquatic invasive species
   posing a conservation burden on Minnesota. Recognizing areas at high
   risk for invasion is a prerequisite for the implementation of risk-based
   prevention and mitigation management strategies. The early detection of
   invasion has been challenging, due in part to the imperfect observation
   process of invasions including the absence of a surveillance program,
   reliance on public reporting, and limited resource availability, which
   results in reporting bias. To predict the areas at high risk for
   invasions, while accounting for underreporting, we combined network
   analysis and probability co-kriging to estimate the risk of ZM and EWM
   invasions. We used network analysis to generate a waterbody-specific
   variable representing boater traffic, a known high risk activity for
   human-mediated transportation of invasive species. In addition,
   co-kriging was used to estimate the probability of species introduction,
   using waterbody-specific variables. A co-kriging model containing
   distance to the nearest ZM infested location, boater traffic, and road
   access was used to recognize the areas at high risk for ZM invasions
   (AUC = 0.78). The EWM cokriging model included distance to the nearest
   EWM infested location, boater traffic, and connectivity to infested
   waterbodies (AUC = 0.76). Results suggested that, by 2015, nearly 20\%
   of the waterbodies in Minnesota were at high risk of ZM (12.45\%) or EWM
   (12.43\%) invasions, whereas only 125/18,411 (0.67\%) and 304/18,411
   (1.65\%) are currently infested, respectively. Prediction methods
   presented here can support decisions related to solving the problems of
   imperfect detection, which subsequently improve the early detection of
   biological invasions.},

Abstract = {Despite massive population declines in the open waters of Lake St. Clair
   due to invasive dreissenid mussels, the St. Clair River Delta has
   persisted as a refuge habitat for native unionid mussels. This study was
   conducted to determine how Dreissena-induced population declines might
   have impacted the genetic population structure of native unionid
   species. Nine variable microsatellite markers were used to assess the
   genetic population structure of the Fatmucket mussel (Lampsilis
   siliquoidea) across 18 sites (n = 341 individuals) within the delta and
   four of its tributaries. Results indicate that Fatmuckets within the
   various bays of the St. Clair Delta and tributaries show limited genetic
   differentiation by geographic distance but still represent a single
   population with evidence of recent gene flow, little differentiation
   among sampling sites, relatively high allelic richness at all sites, and
   little evidence supporting a recent genetic bottleneck. The Fatmucket is
   the most common species found in the delta and poor genetic health and
   connectivity of this species might have indicated a dire situation for
   less common and imperiled species found in the same habitats. Because
   this did not appear to be the case, little can be assumed about other
   mussel species.},

Abstract = {Native communities are thought to mediate the establishment and
   performance of invasive species through competitive and consumptive
   interactions, a concept referred to as ``biotic resistance.'' We
   investigated the generality of this concept across ecosystems. Despite
   the conspicuousness of freshwater invasions, investigations of biotic
   resistance have focused mostly on terrestrial and, more recently, marine
   coastal communities. We collected in-situ studies that tested the
   impacts of native freshwater communities on invading primary producers
   and consumers. Meta-analysis demonstrated that evidence of competitive
   biotic resistance in freshwater habitats was not as strong as that in
   marine and terrestrial ecosystems. In freshwater ecosystems consumptive
   resistance was significantly stronger than competitive resistance and
   consumptive resistance appeared to be as strong in freshwater as in
   marine and terrestrial systems. The limited number of studies
   considering freshwater biotic resistance hindered our ability to
   understand the importance of factors including latitude, experimental
   duration, and method. However, the strength of biotic resistance varied
   among freshwater habitats; specifically, biotic resistance was strongest
   in lentic environments. Our analysis identifies mechanisms underlying
   biotic resistance in freshwater ecosystems that warrant further
   investigation given the potential ongoing and future impacts of invasive
   species in these systems.},

Title = {Environmental factors affecting behavioural responses of an invasive

Abstract = {Antipredator defences of aquatic animals depend on various environmental
   parameters. We studied behavioural responses of a Ponto-Caspian invasive
   bivalve, the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, to conspecific alarm
   cues. We hypothesized that mussels would change their locomotion and
   aggregation in response to alarm signals. We also hypothesized that body
   size, light, substratum quality (suitable or unsuitable for attachment)
   and inclination would affect mussel defences. Changes in horizontal
   movement of mussels exposed to the alarm substance depended on light. In
   the presence of crushed conspecifics illuminated mussels (all sizes)
   moved longer distances than control individuals, whereas in darkness
   their reaction was the opposite. The response of small mussels was the
   strongest. Furthermore, the alarm substance reduced upward relocations
   of all size groups on an inclined surface but at the same time
   stimulated their downward movement. Large and medium mussels (but not
   small individuals) exposed to alarm signals formed aggregations more
   often than control individuals. This effect was only exhibited on sand,
   unsuitable for mussel attachment. Mussels were generally more clumped on
   sand than on hard substratum, suggesting that they did not prefer
   conspecific shells as attachment sites when alternative substrata were
   available. All responses of mussels to alarm cues tended to be stronger
   in light, which is an indirect indication of danger. Our study shows
   that the responses of the zebra mussel to conspecific alarm cues are not
   limited to activity reduction, as previously thought. They are adjusted
   to particular environmental conditions and may also involve increased
   locomotion when relocation to a safer site gives a better chance of
   survival. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Title = {Forecasting the expansion of the invasive golden mussel Limnoperna
   fortunei in Brazilian and North American rivers based on its occurrence
   in the Paraguay River and Pantanal wetland of Brazil},

Pages = {59-73},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The bivalve Limnoperna fortunei (Dunker, 1857), also called golden
   mussel, is native to Asia but becoming dispersed around the world. The
   golden mussel resembles the invasive dreissenid bivalves in many
   respects, and although much less studied it evidently has broader
   environmental tolerances. The golden mussel was introduced into the La
   Plata River estuary (South America) and quickly expanded upstream to the
   north, into the tropical Paraguay River reaching a large floodplain area
   in Brazil known as the Pantanal wetland. The golden mussel tolerates
   environmental conditions in the Pantanal that would be inhospitable for
   most bivalves, but mussel mortality has been observed during the most
   extreme oxygen depletion events. Based on knowledge about the limiting
   factors for the golden mussel in the Pantanal wetland, its potential
   distribution was predicted for the remainder of the Paraguay River basin
   where the species is not present, as well as in other river systems
   throughout Brazil. Forecasts of potential distribution in Brazilian
   river systems were based on physicochemical limitations for shell
   calcification, and specifically on lower thresholds of dissolved calcium
   concentrations and the calcium carbonate (calcite) index of saturation,
   which may be a better indicator of calcification potential in
   low-calcium waters than calcium concentration alone. In addition to
   examining spatial patterns in calcium and calcification potential, these
   and other limnological and climate variables were used in ecological
   niche modeling using GARP and Maxent algorithms. Forecasts of potential
   distributions in three major North American river systems (Mississippi,
   Colorado, and Rio Grande) were based mainly on water temperature because
   calcium availability and calcification evidently would not be limiting
   to golden mussel establishment in those waters. Due to the greater
   tolerance of the golden mussel to conditions known to limit other
   bivalves, as well as its greater ability for shell calcification in
   low-calcium water, the golden mussel could potentially become broadly
   distributed throughout Brazil. According to its thermal tolerance L.
   fortunei could become established in the Mississippi, Colorado and Rio
   Grande drainage systems, although the northern Mississippi River system
   including the Missouri River may be too cool in the winter to support
   the golden mussel.},

Title = {Using maximum entropy to predict the potential distribution of an
   invasive freshwater snail},
Journal = {FRESHWATER BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {61},
Number = {4},
Pages = {457-471},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {1. Ecological niche modelling is a technique used to estimate potential
   distributions of invasive species based on available occurrence data and
   associated environmental conditions. Maximum entropy (Maxent) is a
   powerful method for ecological niche modelling and yet has only rarely
   been applied to aquatic species.
   2. Here we applied Maxent to estimate the potential distribution of the
   invasive Chinese mystery snail (Cipangopaludina chinesis) in Wisconsin
   and analysed several methodological issues associated with using Maxent
   for lentic species.
   3. To generate Maxent estimates of the potential distribution of C.
   chinesis, we used presence records from 292 lakes, five spatially
   explicit climatic variables, and two lake-specific environmental data
   sets (area, conductivity) from 7995 lakes. Our investigations included
   three aspects that could affect model prediction accuracy and
   transferability: (i) combining climate and lake variables into a single
   data set in two different ways, using each lake as a single observation
   and as a grid of 1 ha cells; (ii) varying the size of the background
   data set (locations without presences); and (iii) contrasting
   environmental conditions between locations with and without C. chinesis.
   4. The lake-based model had higher accuracy than the grid-based model,
   although both models had accuracy values indicative of good performance.
   Conductivity and lake area were important predictor variables for both
   models, but had higher contribution to the lake-based model accuracy.
   Decreasing the background sample size minimally affected model accuracy
   and thus Maxent can be used even when background sampling does not meet
   the algorithm's default settings. Lastly, lakes that were
   environmentally dissimilar from lakes with known C. chinesis records
   were more likely to be predicted unsuitable by both grid-based and
   lake-based models.
   5. Overall, the models predicted high potential suitability across
   Wisconsin lakes for C. chinesis, especially in lakes >= 60 ha. Our study
   provides evidence that small or environmentally biased presence data
   sets may underestimate the number of environmentally suitable locations
   of invasive species.},

Abstract = {Johansson ML, Lavigne SY, Ramcharan CW, Heath DD, MacIsaac HJ. Detecting
   a spreading non-indigenous species using multiple methodologies. Lake
   Reserv Manage. XX:XX-XX. Non-indigenous species (NIS) are often
   introduced to novel environments at very low population abundance.
   Detecting the presence of such an NIS can be very challenging,
   particularly as it spreads from the initial establishment site. This
   provides an opportunity to test detection limits using different
   approaches. This study tested the detection capability of 3 methods as
   zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) spread from south to north through
   Lake Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Zebra mussel veliger larvae were
   detected using cross-polarized light microscopy (CPLM), flow cytometry
   and microscopy (FlowCam), and conventional polymerase chain reaction
   (cPCR) analysis of environmental DNA (eDNA) on the same samples.
   Abundance generally declined from south to north in the lake but was
   lowest at Calder's Dock (central). Although abundances could be quite
   low (i.e., <1 veliger/m(3), Calder's Dock) CPLM prevalence-the
   percentage of samples with at least one veliger-was high throughout the
   lake (99-100\% of samples). Prevalence was lower for cPCR and FlowCam
   but was statistically associated with veliger abundance. Using
   standardized 3 mL subsamples (0.06-0.18 m(3)of lake water sampled), all
   3 methods had a high probability of veliger detection if large numbers
   of samples were processed. FlowCam was the most expensive method to
   process these 3 mL subsamples, while cPCR was least expensive and
   fastest. eDNA combined with intensive sampling is the most practical
   method for wide-scale monitoring programs for early detection. However,
   all 3 methods are complementary and could be deployed sequentially, with
   rapid initial sample processing using PCR, confirmation and density
   estimation with FlowCam, and detailed veliger counts using CPLM.},

Title = {The potential for using biological control technologies in the

Journal = {JOURNAL OF SHELLFISH RESEARCH},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {177-183},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Broadly defined, biological control is the use of one species for the
   suppression of another. Two groups of organisms have potential as
   Dreissena control agents: selectively toxic microbes and natural
   enemies.
   Selectively toxic microbes are naturally occurring soil and water
   microorganisms that simply by chance happen to be toxic to Dreissena.
   Applied at artificially high densities to water, the microbial cells per
   se or their released metabolites are selectively lethal to Dreissena. In
   contrast, natural enemies are organisms that, by their evolutionary
   nature, will debilitate or kill Dreissena, including predators,
   parasites (both multicellular and microbial), and benthic competitors
   (organisms capable of competitively displacing Dreissena from
   substrates). Selectively Toxic Microbes: In the short run, these
   microorganisms represent the most promising candidates as biological
   control agents. The use of highly-specific, toxic microbes has a clear
   record of commercial success and environmental safety in the control of
   invertebrate pests in North America, and strains lethal to Dreissena
   have been already isolated. Considering how quickly a selectively toxic
   microbe could move from the laboratory to commercialization, continued
   research to develop this microbial control strategy is a high priority.
   Natural Enemies: In North America, as in Eurasia, there will likely be
   isolated field reports of major impacts by natural enemies, and, on the
   whole, we will likely see a cumulative effect of a complex of enemies
   having a constant, but limited, role in naturally suppressing Dreissena
   populations. In the majority of cases, Dreissena populations will cause
   economic and ecological effects at densities well below those that their
   enemies could naturally maintain. This does not mean, however, that
   certain natural enemies could not be artificially manipulated (e.g.,
   mass produced and released in an inundative fashion) to cause major
   Dreissena reductions.
   1. Parasites: These natural enemies would likely be the most
   environmentally-safe biocontrol agents, due primarily to their high host
   specificity. Comprehensive investigations to identify parasites that are
   strictly specific to Dreissena and that can be economically mass
   produced are a key research priority. Parasites from Dreissena's native
   Eurasian range should be studied to identify species that would be
   ``nearly risk free{''} candidates for importation into North America.
   Research to uncover parasites of Dreissena that are already present in
   North America should be intensified.
   2. Predators: Although organisms, such as fish and birds, have sometimes
   been documented to consume Dreissena at high rates, this does nor
   necessarily mean that they would be effective candidates for use in
   control programs. Predators are typically not specific enough in their
   prey choices. A predator introduced to a waterbody from outside its
   natural range may highly prefer Dreissena as a prey item, but will also
   consume other aquatic organisms. The consumption of such nontarget prey
   could potentially have serious, adverse, ecological impacts.
   3. Benthic Competitors: In addition to being micro/macrofouling
   organisms themselves, the lack of specificity of species that can
   competitively displace Dreissena from substrates (e.g., sponges)
   significantly reduces their potential as biocontrol agents.},

Abstract = {The various life stages of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) were
   examined during the initial years (1991-93) of the mussel's invasion
   into Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron. Yearly trends in densities of larvae,
   newly-settled juveniles, and adults were poorly related. Larval
   densities were lowest in 1991 and increased each year, but the number of
   settled juveniles was highest in 1991. Adults increased between 1991 and
   1992 and then declined in 1993. Mean adult densities at sites with hard
   substrates were 11,700, 33,200, and 4,100/m(2) in each of the 3 years,
   respectively. Year-to-year variation at individual sites was high and
   likely a result of recruitment dynamics and spatial patchiness of
   available substrate. By 1993, densities on hard substrates were
   generally similar throughout the bay, but length-frequency distributions
   in the inner and outer bay were quite different. The 1991-cohort was not
   distinguishable in the inner bay in 1993 either because of poor growth
   or a limited life span, but this cohort was readily distinguishable in
   the outer bay. In addition, ash-free dry weight of a standard 15-mm
   mussel in the inner bay declined 65\% between 1991 and 1993. Although
   food concentrations (chlorophyll and particulate organic carbon)
   declined to low levels in 1993 and both densities and soft-tissue weight
   of Dreissena declined, it is not clear whether populations in the bay
   have peaked and are now at equilibrium with the surrounding environment.},

Abstract = {A rapid assessment method to evaluate the relative impact of zebra
   mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, was undertaken in a 11.5 km(2) temperate
   lake within an Irish drumlin landscape. The lake was divided into three
   assessment units: the north lake, the south lake and a river section
   situated downstream of the two lake assessment units. Survey work was
   conducted as a single survey in September 2011. Following an evaluation
   of the mussel abundance and distribution range within each assessment
   unit, the Biological Pollution Level (BPL) was calculated. Additional
   environmental information was obtained from historical monitoring
   conducted by the Irish Environmental Protection Agency. The zebra mussel
   was rated as having a high abundance and distribution range in one lake
   assessment unit, was absent in the second lake assessment unit, and had
   a low abundance and distribution range for the river assessment unit.
   Ninety-three stations were surveyed in two and a half days illustrating
   a practical approach to monitoring which can meet legislative
   requirements.},

Title = {When will the zebra mussel reach Florence? A model for the spread of
   Dreissena polymorpha in the Arno water system (Italy)},
Journal = {ECOHYDROLOGY},

Abstract = {The zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) is a freshwater bivalve that has
   caused dramatic ecological and economic impacts worldwide in past
   decades. its success as ecosystem invader is mainly due to the species
   ability of spreading along rivers, together with the extremely high
   population densities that can be reached by local populations. Here we
   propose a spatially explicit model aimed at describing the population
   dynamics of mussel colonies in rivers represented as oriented graphs. We
   specifically apply the model to the Bilancino-Sieve-Arno water system
   (Tuscany, Italy), where D. polymorpha has been recently sighted. The
   model accounts for local-scale demographic processes and along-stream
   transport mechanisms. Because of the different temporal scales involved,
   we couple continuous- and discrete-time dynamics. Our model produces
   spatiotemporal scenarios of invasion that present several distinctive
   features of the zebra mussel invasion patterns observed in nature,
   including the spatial patchiness and the temporal irregularity of local
   populations, and the so-called domino effect. The application of our
   model to the Arno case study shows that D. polymorpha could severely
   threaten the city of Florence within a few years. Control measures aimed
   at limiting the impact of the species can significantly alter the
   ecological and environmental parameters. We find that such variations
   may profoundly impact spatiotemporal invasion patterns, possibly with
   counter-intuitive effects. For instance, reduced larval input from Lake
   Bilancino can in some cases produce higher mussel densities in
   downstream colonies. Therefore, the control of D. polymorpha must be
   planned with care in order to prevent unwelcome outcomes. Copyright (c)

Volume = {58},

Abstract = {Preventing the introduction of an invasive species and managing the
   ecological and economic effects of successful invasions often rely on
   accurate predictions of the potential distribution of the species in its
   new habitat. Instances of failed invasion can highlight factors other
   than dispersal that limit range expansion in an invasive species. The
   commercially available waterways (CAWs) of the U.S. are a network of
   interconnected rivers that support a regular traffic of commercial and
   maintenance vessels. As such, they are at extremely high risk of
   infestation from Dreissena, yet not all the rivers are infested. We used
   traffic, water chemistry, and impoundment characteristics of the rivers
   in this system to develop a set of logistic-regression models to predict
   the occurrence of Dreissena. Four single variable models correctly
   classified 20 out of 24 (83\%) river systems. The best two-variable
   models had only one misclassified river, for an overall accuracy of
   96\%. Among rivers to which Dreissena has successfully dispersed,
   permanent populations are most likely to establish in systems that have
   moderate ionic strength and that also have some impoundment areas to
   increase long-term population persistence. We use this hierarchy of
   factors to extend predictions to four systems that currently lack the
   high dispersal intensity of the CAWs.},

Title = {The effects of predation and unionid burrowing on bivalve communities in
   a Laurentian Great Lake coastal wetland},
Journal = {HYDROBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {545},
Pages = {93-102},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Unionid (Mollusca: Unionidae) densities have declined dramatically
   throughout the Laurentian Great Lakes after the introduction of
   dreissenid mussels (Mollusca: Dreissenidae). Recent surveys in some
   Great Lake coastal wetlands have found abundant unionid populations, but
   the factors that reduce zebra mussels on unionids in these habitats are
   not well understood. In 2001-2002, we tested effects of predation and
   unionid burrowing on corbiculids, sphaeriids and dreissenids in a Great
   Lake coastal wetland in western Lake Erie. In one experiment, we reduced
   access by molluscivores using exclosures with two mesh sizes (1.3 cm x
   1.3 cm; 5 cm x 10 cm) and sampled bivalves after 15 months. Small mesh
   exclosures had higher 2 numbers of dreissenids, Corbicula fluminea and
   sphaeriids (54.9, 3.8, 22.6 individuals/in, respectively) than 2 large
   mesh exclosures (0.0, 1.13, 0.13 individuals/m(2), respectively) or open
   controls (0.3, 1.0, 0.1 individuals/m(2), respectively). Numbers of
   dreissenids on C. fluminea were higher in small mesh exclosures (3.8
   dreissenids/Corbicula) than in large mesh exclosures (0.1
   dreissenids/Corbicula) or cageless controls (0 dreissenids/Corbicula).
   In a second experiment, we held two species of live unionids (Leptodea
   fragilis, Quadrula quadrula) and immobile Pyganodon grandis shells in
   exclosures (2.5 cm x 2.5 cm mesh) with either 5 cm, 10 cm, or 20 cm deep
   sediments and sampled bivalves after 2 months. There were fewer
   dreissenids on L. fragilis than P. grandis shells, but there was no
   difference in the number of dreissenids on Q. quadrula and P. grandis
   shells. Numbers of attached dreissenids were higher inside (189-494
   dreissenids/unionid) than outside (8-11 dreissenids/unionid) exclosures,
   and densities of sphaeriid and C. fluminea 2 2 clams were also higher
   inside (21.8, 4.7 individuals/m(2), respectively) than outside (0.4, 0.9
   individuals/m(2) respectively) exclosures. Numbers of attached
   dreissenids were higher on unionids that could burrow below the
   sediments (20 cm depth) than unionids in shallow sediments (5 cm depth)
   for unexplained reasons. Our data suggest that molluseivores can play a
   pivotal role in limiting numbers of bivalves including dreissenids in
   coastal wetlands.},

Title = {The `dirty dozen': socio-economic factors amplify the invasion potential
   of 12 high-risk aquatic invasive species in Great Britain and Ireland},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {50},

Abstract = {Aquatic invasive species are a growing concern to environmental managers
   because of their diverse impacts on aquatic biodiversity and high
   eradication costs, necessitating effective management policies. In this
   study, we evaluate the ability of environmental and socio-economic
   factors to predict the risk of invasion in Great Britain and Ireland of
   12 potential aquatic invaders covering all major aquatic groups. Despite
   their potential to inform risk assessments, this is the first time
   socio-economic factors related to propagule pressure have been
   specifically integrated in distribution modelling. Species distribution
   models (SDM, MaxEnt algorithm) were calibrated with a set of
   environmental factors (e.g. bioclimatic, geographical and geological)
   and integrated with socio-economic (e.g. human influence index,
   population density, closeness to ports) predictors. The inclusion of
   socio-economic factors in SDM did not affect accuracy scores (AUC
   already >0 center dot 90), but their effects were more pronounced in
   spatial predictions, resulting in up to a sixfold amplification of the
   area predicted suitable for each species. Despite the inclusion of
   potential surrogates of water chemistry (e.g. geology) and propagule
   pressure (e.g. population density), temperature-related variables were
   most important predictors of aquatic species' distributions. According
   to SDM, the environmental suitability for a suite of invaders belonging
   to different taxonomic groups and regions of origin is greatest in east
   and south-east England and decreases towards the north and west.
   Multiple invasions in this region are of special concern, as species are
   known to modify their habitat facilitating subsequent invasions, thereby
   potentially exacerbating their impacts. Major management regions to be
   prioritized in monitoring programmes include the Humber, Thames and
   Anglian River Basin Districts. Species of special concern include a
   mysid (Hemimysis anomala), a gammarid (Dikerogammarus villosus), a plant
   (Ludwigia grandiflora) and two crayfishes (Procambarus clarkii and
   P.fallax). Synthesis and Applications. The inclusion of socio-economic
   factors in species distribution models has the potential to improve
   predictions of areas under a highest risk of multiple invasions and to
   help disentangle the complex interplay between biological invasions and
   global environmental and socio-economic processes. Such understanding is
   pivotal to prioritize limited resources for the optimum prevention and
   control of biological invasions.},

Abstract = {The invasive clam Corbicula fluminea causes severe environmental and
   economic impacts in invaded sites and fouled water-dependent industries.
   The biological control of invasive species has potential as an
   effective, safe and low-cost tool. The potential of using direct (clam
   consumption) and indirect approaches (predator-avoidance behaviour) to
   control the pest was evaluated, aiming at establishing a
   proof-of-principle regarding the suitability of such strategies in
   confined settings (e.g. pipelines, channels, raw water tanks and other
   water-dependent facilities). Invertebrate (Procambarus clarkii) and
   vertebrate (Lepomis gibbosus, Luciobarbus bocagei) predators were
   examined for their control potential. In feeding experiments, barbels
   foraged upon C. fluminea but ingested very few clams, and clam
   consumption by crayfish was only observed in the smallest size class (<
   1 cm). Additional experiments linked these results to the protective
   role of the clam's shell. In practical terms, the potential of the fish
   species as C. fluminea predators is limited, but crayfish can be
   important predators of small clams. In a second set of experiments,
   putative predator avoidance by clams was assessed in dual-choice
   aquaria. Refuge availability, predator diet and light conditions were
   taken into account. Clam avoidance was observed under particular
   conditions, but the amplitude of dislocation was limited.},

Abstract = {Benthic algal communities in the Laurentian Great Lakes (USA and Canada)
   have been strongly affected by the invasion of dreissenid mussels. Early
   (1990-1995) studies in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron, demonstrated a shift
   from light to nutrient (phosphorus, P) limitation of benthic algae, and
   large changes in benthic algal community composition once zebra mussels
   (Dreissena polymorpha) became established. We conducted benthic algal
   sampling and a nutrient enrichment experiment at a historic sampling
   site to quantify benthic algae under current environmental conditions
   and to compare current results with historical data. Benthic algal
   P-demand was apparently saturated immediately post-invasion, but in
   subsequent years, algal growth on artificial substrata was consistently
   P-limited (p always <0.005), perhaps as a result of declining mussel
   abundance. Epilithic benthic algal community composition displayed large
   interannual changes, perhaps in response to mussel-induced alteration of
   light availability and natural changes in substratum characteristics at

Title = {Fouling mussels (Dreissena spp.) colonize soft sediments in Lake Erie
   and facilitate benthic invertebrates},
Journal = {FRESHWATER BIOLOGY},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {43},
Number = {1},
Pages = {85-97},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {1. We conducted survey and transplant studies to determine whether
   colonization and residency on soft sediments by introduced, fouling
   mussels (Dreissena polymorpha and D. bugensis) were affected by physical
   disturbance, and whether Dreissena presence in turn influenced the
   diversity and population densities of other benthic invertebrates.
   Surveys revealed that colony density was typically higher at moderate
   depths than at shallower and greater ones. However, the largest,
   midsummer colonies and greatest coverage of sediments by mussels
   occurred at deeper sites.
   2. Disturbance of transplanted colonies varied by depth and colony size,
   with deeper and larger colonies experiencing the lowest destruction
   rates. Colony destruction rate was positively correlated with current
   velocity adjacent to the lakebed.
   3. Absence of mussel colonies at shallow sites was not determined by
   recruitment or substrate limitation, as recruit density was higher and
   sediment characteristics more suitable for postveliger settlement at
   shallow than at deeper sites. Rather, seasonal storms have much stronger
   effects in shallow than in deep water.
   4. Mussel residency on soft sediment has profound effects on
   invertebrate biodiversity. Invertebrate species (taxon) richness and
   total abundance were positively correlated with mussel colony area.
   Mussel-sediment habitat supported between 462 and 703\% more taxa, and
   between 202 and 335\% more individuals (exclusive of Dreissena) than
   adjacent soft-sediment lacking mussels.
   5. Results from this study illustrate-that physical disturbance directly
   limits the distribution of mussels on soft sediments, and the diversity
   and abundance of other benthic invertebrates in consequence.},

Journal = {TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY},

Volume = {133},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Recent environmental changes in the Bay of Quinte, Lake Ontario, have
   coincided with a decline in the stocks of walleye Sander vitreus.
   Suitable habitat supply was estimated in three sections of the bay
   during the summers of 1972-2001 to assess its role in the decline. An
   empirical model was developed to predict suitable habitat area for
   walleyes based on their preferences for cool water and low light
   intensity. The results indicated that lack of suitable light limits
   walleye habitat in the bay. Walleye habitat in the shallow upper bay has
   decreased at the rate of 34 ha/year since the invasion of dreissenid
   mussels in 1994, while that in the middle and lower bays has remained
   abundant. Walleye stocks and suitable habitat in the upper bay have both
   declined since the early 1990s. However, this pattern has not been
   consistent through time and suggests that other factors have also
   affected the Bay of Quinte walleye population. The analyses developed
   here can be used as a tool to enhance the assessment of walleye habitat
   dynamics in the Bay of Quinte and allow us to examine the impact of
   oligotrophication on the habitat of an important recreational and
   commercial species.},

Volume = {10},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Research on alien and invasive species focuses on the direct effects of
   invasion on native ecosystems, and the possible positive effects of
   their presence are most often overlooked. Our aim was to check the
   suitability of selected alien species (the snail Physa acuta, the
   bivalve Dreissena polymorpha, and the gammarid Dikerogammarus villosus)
   as diluents for infectious bird schistosome cercariae-the etiological
   factor of swimmer's itch. It has been hypothesized that alien species
   with different feeding habits (scrapers, filterers and predators) that
   cohabit the aquatic environment with intermediate hosts of the
   schistosomatid trematodes are capable of feeding on their free-swimming
   stages-cercariae. In the laboratory conditions used, all experimental
   animals diluted the cercariae of bird schistosome. The most effective
   diluents were P. acuta and D. villosus. However, a wide discrepancy in
   the dilution of the cercariae between replicates was found for
   gammarids. The obtained results confirm the hypothesis that increased
   biodiversity, even when alien species are involved, creates the dilution
   effect of the free-living stages of parasites. Determining the best
   diluent for bird schistosome cercariae could greatly assist in the
   development of current bathing areas protection measures against

   respect to fresh and brackish European waters},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {This paper reviews published knowledge on how to deal with invasive
   species during biological quality assessments in European river systems
   for water management and assessments of ecological quality required, for
   example, by the European Water Frame Work Directive. The papers studied
   included international papers and some standards for water assessment.
   An overview of the current state of neozoa research showed that many
   different topics are treated, comprising biogeography and fauna records,
   species replacements and effectiveness of colonisation, life cycles,
   competition between native and invasive species, habitat quality and
   pathways of migration. Additionally, some papers have been published
   recently on the integration of neozoa in index-based assessment systems.
   Although the decline or increase of alien species populations and the
   corresponding impacts on indigenous populations were frequently
   observed, the mechanisms behind the invasions often remain hypothetical.
   In the reviewed papers, issues such as possible reasons for coexistence,
   tolerances, quality of habitat or water, life history traits and
   introduction of diseases were rarely covered. Few neozoa are
   sufficiently investigated to be categorised as indicators. After
   discussing the advantages and disadvantages of inclusion or exclusion,
   inclusion of invaders in assessments of both biodiversity (all species)
   and human impact (only species classified in their specific tolerance)
   is suggested. Further research is required to (1) update and assign
   ecological profiles of the non-indigenous species currently and (2)
   assess the effects of new invaders on native communities.},

Title = {Can filter-feeding Asian carp invade the Laurentian Great Lakes? A
   bioenergetic modelling exercise},
Journal = {FRESHWATER BIOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {55},
Number = {10},
Pages = {2138-2152},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {P>1. There is much concern that filter-feeding Asian carp will invade
   the Laurentian Great Lakes and deplete crucial plankton resources. We
   developed bioenergetic models, using parameters from Asian carp and
   other fish species, to explore the possibility that planktonic food
   resources are insufficient to support the growth of silver carp
   (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and bighead carp (H. nobilis) in the Great
   Lakes.
   2. The models estimated basic metabolic requirements of silver and
   bighead carp under various body sizes, swimming speeds and reproductive
   stages. These requirements were then related to planktonic food
   resources and environmental temperature to predict when and where silver
   and bighead carp may survive in the Great Lakes, and how far they may
   travel.
   3. Parameter values for respiration functions were derived
   experimentally in a coordinated study of silver and bighead carp, while
   consumption parameters were obtained from the literature on silver carp.
   Other model parameters lacking for Asian carp, such as those for
   egestion and excretion, were obtained from the literature on other fish
   species.
   4. We found that full-sized bighead carp required 61.0 kJ d-1 just to
   maintain their body mass at 20 degrees C, approximately equivalent to
   feeding in a region with 255 mu g L-1 macrozooplankton (dry) or 10.43 mu
   g L-1 chlorophyll a. Silver carp energy requirements were slightly
   higher.
   5. When applied to various habitats in the Great Lakes, our results
   suggest that silver and bighead carp will be unable to colonise most
   open-water regions because of limited plankton availability. However, in
   some circumstances, carp metabolism at lower temperatures may be low
   enough to permit positive growth even at very low rations. Positive
   growth is even more likely in productive embayments and wetlands, and
   the modelled swimming costs in some of these habitats suggest that carp
   could travel > 1 km d-1 without losing biomass.
   6. The simulation (and firmly hypothetical) results from this modelling
   study suggest when and where Asian carp could become established in the
   Great Lakes. Given the potential consequences to Great Lakes ecosystems
   if these filter feeders do prove capable of establishing reproducing
   populations, efforts to keep Asian carp out of the Great Lakes must not
   be lessened. However, we do encourage the use of bioenergetic modelling
   in a holistic approach to assessing the risk of Asian carp invasion in
   the Great Lakes region.},

Title = {Submerged aquatic vegetation in the Bay of Quinte: Response to decreased
   phosphorous loading and Zebra Mussel invasion},
Journal = {AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH \& MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Pages = {442-452},
Abstract = {Originally mesotrophic, the Bay of Quinte ecosystem has experienced
   eutrophication since the 1940s, which resulted in the decline of
   once-lush submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) beds in the upper bay by
   the mid-1960s. Since 1972, twelve SAV surveys have been conducted along
   ten index transects, recording:\% cover, distance SAV beds extended from
   shore (extent), maximum depth of colonization (Zc), species composition,
   and, in later years, wet plant biomass. Offshore secchi depth and ?par,
   (the vertical light extinction rate (m-1) for photosynthetically active
   radiation), were also recorded either weekly or bi-weekly during the
   growing season since 1972. During this time, two major changes occurred
   within the bay: the reduction in point-source phosphorus (P-control)
   loadings in 1978 and the 1993 invasion by Dreissenid Mussel. SAV
   response to these changes varied temporally and spatially, with the
   shallow upper bay showing the greatest response, particularly after
   Zebra Mussels establishment. In the upper bay, mean secchi depth
   increased by 8\% from 1.2 m prior to P-control (pre-P), to 1.3 m after
   P-control (post-P) and further increased by 46\% to 1.9 m after
   Dreissena establishment (post-D). Upper bay SAV responded to these
   invasive species with increases in the means of three variables: Zc from
   1.6 to 3.5 m, extent from 114 m to 417 m and wet biomass from 50 g m-2
   to 962 g m-2. SAV in the middle and lower bays were in better condition
   in 1972, with pre-P cover in excess of 50\% and Zc of 2.6 and 3.7 m,
   respectively. SAV cover did increase in the post-D (1994 to 2007) period
   by approximately 25\% and Zc increased to 3.7 and 6.5 m, but the narrow
   fringing strip of shallower water along the shore in these two deeper
   bays limited substantial increases in bed extent. Both water clarity and
   basin morphometry strongly influenced SAV distribution and abundance
   within the Bay of Quinte.},

Abstract = {Plasmonic nanosensors for label-free detection of DNA require excellent
   sensing resolution, which is crucial when monitoring short DNA
   sequences, as these induce tiny peak shifts, compared to large
   biomolecules. We report a versatile and simple strategy for plasmonic
   sensor signal enhancement by assembling multiple (four) plasmonic
   sensors in series. This approach provided a fourfold signal enhancement,
   increased signal-to-noise ratio, and improved sensitivity for DNA
   detection. The response of multiple sensors based on AuNSpheres was also
   compared with AuNRods, the latter showing better sensing resolution. The
   amplification system based on AuNR was integrated into a microfluidic
   sequential injection platform and applied to the monitoring of DNA,
   specifically from environmental invasive species-zebra mussels. DNA from
   zebra mussels was log concentration-dependent from 1 to 1 x 10(6) pM,
   reaching a detection limit of 2.0 pM. In site tests were also
   successfully applied to real samples, within less than 45 min, using DNA
   extracted from zebra mussel meat. The plasmonic nanosensors' signal can
   be used as a binary output (yes/no) to assess the presence of those
   invasive species. Even though these genosensors were applied to the
   monitoring of DNA in environmental samples, they potentially offer
   advantage in a wide range of fields, such as disease diagnostics.},

Title = {Development and characterization of 29 microsatellite markers for

Abstract = {Ligumia nasuta (Say, 1817; Eastern Pondmussel) is an imperiled
   freshwater mussel (Unionidae) in eastern North America. Population
   declines in the Laurentian Great Lakes resulting from the introduction
   of dreissenid mussels and habitat destruction in the 20th Century have
   greatly reduced and limited its distribution. To properly inform
   restoration and management efforts for L. nasuta, fine-scale genetic
   analyses must be performed on the remnant populations. This study used
   Illumina paired-end shotgun sequencing to identify potential
   microsatellite loci for L. nasuta, utilizing two samples to develop the
   Illumina paired-end shotgun library. Forty-eight primer pairs were
   tested on the remaining 24 samples. Twenty-nine of the 48 microsatellite
   primer sets screened were successfully amplified using 24 L nasuta
   samples collected from the Great Lakes watershed. The estimated fragment
   size ranged from 167 to 445 base-pairs (bp) and the number of alleles
   per locus varied between 5 and 16 (mean = 9.7). Only five of the loci
   deviated significantly from Hardy-Weinberg expectations after Bonferroni
   corrections. The development of these new microsatellite loci will
   greatly facilitate future genetic studies on L nasuta. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Green Bay is the largest freshwater estuarine system on earth, drains
   one-third of the Lake Michigan basin and delivers one-third of the
   lake's phosphorus load. Southern Green Bay is a designated area of
   concern due to ecosystem degradation that includes eutrophication,
   harmful algal blooms, hypoxia, lost or altered habitat, and reduced
   water quality. While marine estuaries are subject to tidal influence and
   saltwater intrusion, this freshwater estuary is subject to lake
   intrusion of freshwater with different quality parameters. Understanding
   the simultaneous effects of tributary flows and lake intrusions is
   crucial to comprehend the dynamics of freshwater estuaries. A single
   hydrodynamic, wind-wave, and sediment transport model was developed for
   the lake and its estuary. This approach provides fine resolution in the
   estuary and simulates directly the combined effects of tributary flows
   and lake intrusions. The approach overcomes open-boundary limitations of
   nested models, and of whole-lake models that lack sufficient resolution
   or wind-wave and sediment transport simulation. The model confirms
   findings of previous studies and demonstrates how the circulation,
   thermal regime, wave action, and sediment transport in the estuary
   depend on meteorological forcing, tributary flows, and lake intrusions.
   The stage is set to apply this approach to study biogeochemical
   processes in lakes and estuaries.},

Title = {Application of bioclimatic models coupled with network analysis for risk

Abstract = {In this study we use a combination of techniques to assess the general
   risk of invasion by the aquatic invader Dikerogammarus villosus in Great
   Britain at multiple scales. First, bioclimatic models (Support Vector
   Machine algorithm) were used to identify regions showing the highest
   climatic match with the European range of the species, and that might be
   at highest risk of initial colonization if provided with propagules. The
   model showed that nearly 60\% of Great Britain shows the minimum
   bioclimatic suitability for the species, particularly southern and
   eastern England. Afterwards, a Network Analysis was used to model the
   natural spatio-temporal spread of the killer shrimp in the Great Ouse
   River catchment (SE England), the first region invaded by this species.
   This model suggested that the northern part of the catchment, including
   two relevant Ramsar sites (Ouse Washes and Wicken fen) are at serious
   risk of being invaded in the short-term (<5 years). Taking into account
   the rapid spread of the killer shrimp in other European countries, its
   broad environmental tolerance, the high climate suitability of broad
   areas of Great Britain to the species, the current spread of other
   Ponto-Caspian species, and the high natural and artificial connectivity
   of the hydrological network, we conclude that D. villosus is very likely
   to continue its spread in Great Britain, dramatically affecting the
   native biodiversity. The multi-scale approach proposed in this study
   combines large-scale bioclimatic models with local-scale dispersal
   models, providing managers with a powerful spatial and temporal basis
   for informed decision-making.},

Abstract = {Species introduced to the Great Lakes region through shipping, pet and
   nursery trade, and as biological control have caused significant
   environmental damages and have increased the direct and indirect costs
   to boat owners and various water-dependent industries. Once established,
   recreational boating becomes the primary vector of spread for some of
   these species, such as zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha Pallas,
   1771). Prevention and mitigation efforts in the past have focused on
   boater education, boat washing stations, and inspections; yet these
   management actions can be expensive with limited or largely unknown
   effectiveness. In this study, we used a gravity model framework to
   accurately simulate the spread of an aquatic invasive species. After
   parameterization, the constructed model effectively simulated the
   human-mediated movements of the historical dreissenid spread patterns,
   correctly predicting an average accuracy of 78.2\% (standard deviation =
   0.01\%) lakes invaded per model run. We then used the model to determine
   the effectiveness of three different invasive species management
   scenarios in Michigan: deterring boaters from lakes with a high
   likelihood of invasion, targeted education at high-risk lakes, and a
   large-scale education effort. Results indicated that deterring boaters
   from high-risk lakes is effective in the first five years of an
   invasion, targeted education is more effective at late stages of an
   invasion, and large-scale education is effective at all stages of an
   invasion. Our results indicate that managers should be flexible in their
   management actions and that different strategies are likely more
   effective at different stages of an invasion.},

Abstract = {Increased global trade and modern intercontinental transportation have
   made invasive species an increasingly prominent stressor of freshwater
   ecosystems. Invasive species risk assessments, which range from simple
   screening protocols that focus on species attributes and ecological
   requirements to rigorous analyses of infestation, have become an
   important component of environmental impact assessment. In this paper we
   present two recent case studies in which risk and decision methods were
   applied to non-toxicological environmental issues that are central to
   many aquatic ecosystem management programs. The first example reviews
   potential infestation by the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, on
   Bayou Bartholomew, located in southeast Arkansas, as a result of the
   proposed augmentation of low flow conditions by pumping water from the
   nearby and much larger Arkansas River. The second example presents a
   retrospective analysis of the results of transplanting fat pocketbook
   pearly mussels, Potarnilus capax, from an approximately 6-km reach of a
   drainage ditch in eastern Arkansas. The two examples presented herein
   indicate the potential for improving environmental decision-making in
   the face of uncertainty-but in the presence of substantial information.
   As more rigorous attempts are made to widen and enhance applications of
   risk and decision methods to environmental decision-making, ecosystem
   management is likely to further improve.},

Abstract = {Zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) is considered as one of the 100 most
   harmful IAS in the world. Traditional detection methods have
   limitations, and PCR based environmental DNA detection has provided
   interesting results for early warning. However, in the last years, the
   development of isothermal amplification methods has received increasing
   attention. Among them, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has
   several advantages, including its higher tolerance to the presence of
   inhibitors and the possibility of naked-eye detection, which enables and
   simplifies its potential use in decentralized settings. In the current
   study, a real-time LAMP (qLAMP) method for the detection of Dreissena
   polymorpha was developed and tested with samples from the Guadalquivir
   River basin, together with two real-time PCR (qPCR) methods using
   different detection chemistries, targeting a specific region of the
   mitochondrial gene cytochrome C oxidase subunit I. All three developed
   approaches were evaluated regarding specificity, sensitivity and time
   required for detection. Regarding sensitivity, both qPCR approaches were
   more sensitive than qLAMP by one order of magnitude, however the qLAMP
   method proved to be as specific and much faster being performed in just
   9 min versus 23 and 29 min for the qPCR methods based on hydrolysis
   probe and intercalating dye respectively.},

Abstract = {The filter-feeding clam Corbicula fluminea has widely spread from its
   Asiatic origin into freshwater habitats on several continents, where it
   often has a considerable impact on ecosystem processes. The present
   study was stimulated by the observation that C. fluminea can experience
   mass mortality during warm summers, even when temperatures are still far
   below the lethal level. We hypothesized that starvation due to low food
   quantities during summer is a main factor in this context. In order to
   test nutritional conditions in an environment where summer mortality
   occurred, the clams' body mass was tracked in river bypass systems
   installed at the Lower River Rhine (Germany and The Netherlands). Two
   food levels were adjusted in the bypass channels: one corresponding to
   the original chlorophyll level in the river (ambient food) and one with
   a chlorophyll a level reduced by about 50\% (low food). The clams kept
   at the ambient food level increased their shell length during summer,
   although growth rates decreased at low food levels in the River Rhine in
   late summer. In contrast to shell length, body mass decrease in late
   summer cumulated in 94\% reduction from August until October. This trend
   was enhanced by the experimental food reduction, i.e., clams kept in the
   low food level treatments weighed 60\% less than the clams in the
   ambient food treatment at the end of summer. However, mortality was low
   in both treatments. The data demonstrate a high plasticity in the body
   mass of C. fluminea. The corresponding possibility to respire body mass
   can be seen as one strategy to survive longer starvation periods.},

Title = {The functional role of burrowing bivalves in freshwater ecosystems},
Journal = {FRESHWATER BIOLOGY},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {46},
Number = {11},
Pages = {1431-1446},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {1. Freshwater systems are losing biodiversity at a rapid rate, yet we
   know little about the functional role of most of this biodiversity. The
   ecosystem roles of freshwater burrowing bivalves have been particularly
   understudied. Here we summarize what is known about the functional role
   of burrowing bivalves in the orders Unionoida and Veneroida in lakes and
   streams globally.
   2. Bivalves filter phytoplankton, bacteria and particulate organic
   matter from the water column. Corbicula and sphaeriids also remove
   organic matter from the sediment by deposit feeding, as may some
   unionids. Filtration rate varies with bivalve species and size,
   temperature, particle size and concentration, and flow regime.
   3. Bivalves affect nutrient dynamics in freshwater systems, through
   excretion as well as biodeposition of faeces and pseudofaeces. Excretion
   rates are both size and species dependent, are influenced by
   reproductive stage, and vary greatly with temperature and food
   availability.
   4. Bioturbation of sediments through bivalve movements increases
   sediment water and oxygen content and releases nutrients from the
   sediment to the water column. The physical presence of bivalve shells
   creates habitat for epiphytic and epizoic organisms, and stabilizes
   sediment and provides refugia for benthic fauna. Biodeposition of faeces
   and pseudofaeces can alter the composition of benthic communities.
   5. There is conflicting evidence concerning the role of resource
   limitation in structuring bivalve communities. Control by bivalves of
   primary production is most likely when their biomass is large relative
   to the water volume and where hydrologic residence time is long. Future
   studies should consider exactly what bivalves feed upon, whether feeding
   varies seasonally and with habitat, and whether significant overlap in
   diet occurs. In particular, we need a clearer picture of the importance
   of suspension versus deposit feeding and the potential advantages and
   tradeoffs between these two feeding modes.
   6. In North America, native burrowing bivalves (Unionidae) are declining
   at a catastrophic rate. This significant loss of benthic biomass,
   coupled with the invasion of an exotic burrowing bivalve (Corbicula),
   may result in large alterations of ecosystem processes and functions.},

Title = {Population and Reproductive Dynamics of Zebra Mussels (Dreissena
   polymorpha) in Warm, Low-Latitude North American Waters},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL BULLETIN},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {242},
Number = {3},

Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha), first reported in Texas during
   2009, have infested 28 Texas reservoirs over 11 years. This species has
   not previously invaded water bodies as warm as those in Texas, where
   temperatures approach or exceed its previously accepted incipient upper
   thermal limit of 30 degrees C, raising the question of how such
   temperatures impact its population dynamics. Over 3-5 years, monthly
   collections of mussels, sampling for planktonic mussel veligers,
   juvenile settlement data, and water quality parameters, were undertaken
   at Texas lakes Texoma, Ray Roberts, and Belton to estimate mussel shell
   length growth rates, life spans, reproductive periods, and settlement
   patterns. Biannual spawning periods occurred at water temperatures of 18
   to 28 degrees C, resulting in distinct spring and fall juvenile
   settlement cohorts. Growth rates were rapid, with both cohorts attaining
   mean maximum shell lengths of 20-25 mm within 8-15 months of settlement,
   compared to European and northeastern US populations that attained
   similar sizes after 2-4 years. Shortened life spans were demarcated by
   adult mussel die-offs during summer months of elevated water temperature
   the year after initial settlement, leading to short-term cyclical
   fluctuations in population densities. Large-scale mussel die-offs were
   caused by flooding and hypoxia events. Elevated temperatures appeared to
   facilitate mussel invasiveness by increasing spawning frequency and
   elevating growth rates, thus reducing time to maturity and allowing
   population recovery within 1-2 years after environmentally induced
   severe population declines.},

Abstract = {There are serious concerns for native freshwater mussel survival
   (Bivalvia: Unionidae) in the Laurentian Great Lakes region after
   populations were seemingly pushed to the brink of extirpation following
   the introduction of dreissenid mussels (D.reissena polymorpha and D.
   rostriformis bugensis) in the mid-1980s. The Detroit River was the first
   major river system in North America to be invaded by dreissenids, and
   unionids were considered extirpated from the river by 1998. Since then
   several unionid refuges (areas with relatively low dreissenid impact and
   surviving unionids) have been found in coastal areas of lakes St. Clair
   and Erie, but no documentation exists in the Detroit River. To assess
   dreissenid presence and potential unionid persistence, a mixture of
   stratified random, historical, and potential refuge sites were surveyed
   during summer 2019 in the Detroit River. Unionid and dreissenid habitat
   use was further investigated with analysis of variance and
   classification tree analyses. Of the 56 sites surveyed, only five sites
   had live unionids totaling 220 animals of 11 species. More than 2000
   unionid shells of 31 species were collected from 39 sites, confirming
   the large and diverse unionid populations that existed prior to the
   dreissenid invasion. Ninety-eight percent of live unionids found showed
   evidence of past or present dreissenid attachment. Estimated dreissenid
   densities were highly variable with river location and ranged from 0 to
   5673 live individuals per m(2), with the largest densities concentrated
   in the upstream half of the Detroit River. Despite their previously
   assumed extirpation from the Detroit River, live unionids wei found
   during this comprehensive survey. Although only 40\% of the historical
   species within the unionid assemblage remains, our results suggest, in
   the right conditions, some co-existence is possible among some species
   of unionids and dreissenids in this large river system.},

Abstract = {Predators shape the behavior and distribution of prey organisms, driving
   their evolution and environmental impact. We studied relationships
   between interspecific competition and predation risk in Ponto-Caspian
   invasive gammarid crustaceans: Pontogammarus robustoides and
   Dikerogammarus villosus. We hypothesized that a stronger competitor D.
   villosus would displace P. robustoides from a preferred habitat, but the
   frequency of this displacement would be reduced in the presence of a
   higher fish predator, the racer goby. We studied gammarid preferences
   for stone or sand substrata in 24-h pairwise-choice tests in
   single-species or mixed-species treatments, at 2 densities (12 or 24
   individuals per tank), in the presence or absence of a predator. D.
   villosus displaced P. robustoides from the stone habitat, even at the
   low density. As P. robustoides tested separately preferred stones at
   both densities, its displacement resulted from active avoidance of a
   stronger competitor even when the substratum was not actually a limited
   resource. The presence of a predator reduced the number of instances of
   displacement of P. robustoides by D. villosus, allowing the weaker
   species to stay on its preferred substratum. Nevertheless, the presence
   of D. villosus still increased fish predation on P. robustoides. The
   presence of a predator modifies relationships between prey organisms,
   allowing a weaker competitor to stay in its preferred habitat. Thus,
   anti-predator responses of prey organisms may have cascading effects on
   the functioning of the community, affecting habitat choice and
   competition among species.},

Abstract = {Competition not only occurs between species, but (probably more
   importantly) also among individuals within species, especially, for
   species occurring in high densities and when resources are limiting.
   Fluctuating densities and dietary overlap may account for massive
   ecological and evolutionary changes in fish communities. We sampled a
   mixed juvenile (0+ stages, being younger than 1 year of age) fish
   community at the Lower Rhine over three consecutive years, including
   native and newly established species (similar to 64,000 captured
   individuals and similar to 4200 dissected fish). Our aim was to develop
   a new approach in which data on density, individual consumption rates,
   and diet overlaps (both intra- and interspecific) solely originating
   from the natural environment, were used and combined to estimate
   species-specific competitive strengths within and between seasons and
   species. The juvenile fish community at the food-limited Rhine was
   dominated by invasive gobies. Species-specific consumption rates
   decreased depending on the dietary overlap with other juveniles. Two
   invasive gobies (Neogobius melanostomus and N. fluviatilis) showed the
   greatest competitive abilities, followed by a third invasive Gobiid
   species (Ponticola kessleri) and the native Aspius aspius, a species
   utilizing an exclusive food source. Both other native species (Perca
   fluviatilis and Sander lucioperca) had the lowest estimates of
   food-related competitive strength, indicating that these species are
   forced into a juvenile competitive bottleneck by the invasive gobies,
   before they finally can develop into successful predators on gobies
   later in life. Our new analytical approach to measure dietary
   competitive strength among individuals provides a powerful tool to
   empirically study eco-evolutionary feedback dynamics in the field.},

Title = {Biophysical modeling assessment of the drivers for plankton dynamics in

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},

Volume = {308},

Abstract = {Given that phytoplankton and zooplankton communities have served as key
   ecological indicators of anthropogenic and other perturbations, a
   high-resolution Finite Volume Coastal Ocean Model (FVCOM) based
   Integrated Compartment Model (FVCOM-ICM) was implemented to investigate
   plankton dynamics with the inclusion of dreissenid invasion in Lake
   Erie, particularly in the most productive western basin. After
   identifying suitable horizontal and vertical resolutions that allowed
   for accurate depiction of in-lake nutrient concentrations and plankton
   biomass, we explored how variation in nutrient (phosphorus, nitrogen)
   loading and dreissenid mussel density could influence plankton dynamics.
   Our scenario-testing showed that western Lake Erie's phytoplankton
   community appeared more limited by phosphorus than nitrogen on both
   seasonal and interannual scales with light limitation occurring in the
   nearshore and Maumee River plume areas. Dreissenid mussel impacts varied
   temporally, with phytoplankton communities being highly influenced by
   dreissenid nutrient excretion at times (under low nutrient availability)
   and dreissenid grazing at other times (under bloom conditions). It was
   concluded that the effect of zooplankton predation on phytoplankton was
   stronger than that of dreissenid mussels, and that multiple algal groups
   could promote the efficiency of nutrient assimilation and the overall
   plankton production. Additionally, river inputs and wind-driven water
   circulation were important by causing heterogeneity in habitat
   conditions through nutrient advection and vertical mixing, and
   wind-induced surface waves could result in non-negligible down-wind
   redistribution of plankton biomass, which increased with wind/wave
   magnitude. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The freshwater mussel Limnoperna fortunei is adapted to colonize a wide
   range of aquatic environments, and its ability to contend with
   environmental stress through phenotypic plasticity has allowed this
   species to successfully colonize and become established in new regions.
   Only limited information is currently available on the wide
   intraspecific variability of this species in response to environmental
   heterogeneity. Here, we tested the hypotheses that (1) growth and body
   weight of mussels from a highly polluted environment differed from those
   from a less polluted habitat, and (2) growth parameters estimated in
   this study differed from those reported for other invaded ecosystems. We
   conducted controlled field experiments in two study sites with differing
   levels of pollution. To compare our results to those reported elsewhere,
   we considered growth data from studies performed in different locations.
   We found that mussels from the more polluted habitat showed lower shell
   growth and body weight than those from the less polluted environment. We
   also observed differences in the growth performances of the golden
   mussel between our estimates and those from other invaded habitats. Our
   findings provide useful information to better understand the striking
   intraspecific variability of this species in response to stressful
   conditions. Knowledge on the phenotypic plasticity of Limnoperna
   fortunei is essential for predicting and managing this species.},

Abstract = {The accidental spread of aquatic invasive species (AIS) by recreational
   boaters is a major concern of state and county environmental planners in
   the USA. While programs for watercraft inspection to educate boaters and
   slow AIS spread are common practice, large numbers of boats and
   waterbodies, together with limited budgets, make program design
   difficult. To facilitate program design, we developed an integer
   programming model for allocation of scarce inspection resources among
   lakes. Our model uses species-specific infestation status of lakes and
   estimates of boat movement between lakes. The objective is to select
   lakes for inspection stations to maximize the number of risky boats
   inspected, where risky boats are ones that move from infested to
   uninfested lakes. We apply our model in Stearns County in central
   Minnesota, USA, to prioritize lakes for inspection stations and evaluate
   alternative management objectives. With an objective of protecting
   uninfested lakes within and outside Stearns County, the optimal policy
   is to locate stations at infested lakes having the most boats departing
   for uninfested lakes inside and outside the county. With an objective of
   protecting only Stearns County lakes, the optimal policy is to locate
   stations at both infested and uninfested lakes having the riskiest boats
   arriving from within and outside the county and departing to in-county
   lakes. The tradeoff between these objectives is significant.},

Volume = {10},

Abstract = {Tools that bolster early detection of invasive dreissenid mussels are
   needed to prevent their spread across western North America. In this
   study, we assessed if environmental DNA (eDNA) can extend the seasonal
   window for dreissenid mussel early detection beyond that of plankton
   tows, which are limited to warmer seasons when mussel larvae are
   present. We focused eDNA sampling efforts at multiple sites in Tiber
   Reservoir (Montana) where dreissenid mussel abundance is hypothesized to
   be low. Samples were collected in June and October 2017, when water
   temperatures were cooler than thermal optima for dreissenid
   reproduction. and in July 2017 when water temperatures were wanner and
   conducive for reproduction. We detected dreissenid mussel DNA in June,
   July and October even though no dreissenid mussels were observed using
   non-molecular tools in 2017. A subset of positive and negative eDNA
   samples was analyzed by an independent lab and results were
   corroborated. We then estimated the effort needed for 95\% probability
   detection of dreissenid DNA at each site within Tiber Reservoir and
   found that as many as 27, 14, and 34 samples needed to be collected in
   June. July and October, respectively. To further validate the utility of
   eDNA. we also present ancillary eDNA results from other waters in the
   Flathead Reservation (Montana) where dreissenid mussels have never been
   detected and from waters with established zebra mussel populations in
   the upper Mississippi River. which were sampled in the spring when water
   temperatures were cooler than thermal optima for dreissenid
   reproduction. All Flathead Reservation samples were negative for
   dreissenid mussel DNA, while all upper Mississippi River samples were
   positive. This study adds to a growing body of research that
   demonstrates eDNA is a highly sensitive tool for dreissenid mussel
   surveillance in newly invaded waters, including colder seasons when
   non-molecular tools are likely to be less effective or more challenging
   to employ.},

   simulation shows that water surface temperature and vertical thermal
   structure can be well reproduced. Driven by the simulated vertical
   mixing, the biological model solves the transport and transformation of
   nutrients, plankton and detritus in the water column. Mussel grazing and
   excretion are added at the bottom boundary. The biological model
   predicts a notable decline of phytoplankton biomass and considerable
   increase of dissolved phosphorus (DP) in the entire water column at the
   end of spring. However, the reduction of phytoplankton and the increase
   of DP are limited to the bottom 20 m in summer as a result of the strong
   stratification. Model results also show that mussels can maximize
   particle delivery to the benthos, as the modeled benthic diffusive flux
   of particulate phosphorus exceeds the passive settling rate by 4.2x on
   average. Model simulation over a 10-month period indicates that
   profundal mussels have the potential to significantly change the
   distribution of energy and nutrients in the water column, even in a deep
   and stratified environment.},

Title = {The role of host specificity in explaining the invasion success of the
   freshwater mussel Anodonta woodiana in Europe},

Year = {2012},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Several freshwater mussel species represent some of the most problematic
   invasive species and have considerably altered ecosystems worldwide.
   Their invasion potential has been partially attributed to their
   free-living larvae, which have a high dispersal capability. We
   investigated the invasion potential of Anodonta (Sinanodonta) woodiana,
   a species of East Asian unionid mussel established worldwide despite
   having an obligatory parasitic stage (glochidium), which must encyst on
   host fish. The invasion success of A. woodiana has been attributed to
   the success of worldwide introductions of its sympatric fish hosts. We
   experimentally found, however, that A. woodiana is a broad host
   generalist, which can complete its development on all eight fish species
   tested, both coinvasive and native. Subsequently, we used a data on the
   occurrence and relative abundance of potential hosts in river habitats
   in the Czech Republic to project scenarios of the effect of host
   availability on A. woodiana invasion. We found that host availability
   does not constitute a major limit for A. woodiana to colonise most
   aquatic habitats in Central Europe. In addition, we investigated
   seasonal dynamics of A. woodiana reproduction and did not detect any
   limitations of its reproduction by ambient water temperatures typical of
   a Central European lowland river. Consequently, we predict that A.
   woodiana may further increase the speed and range of its invasion and we
   discuss possible consequences to native habitats and communities,
   especially to the endangered species of unionid mussels.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH},
Year = {2007},

Abstract = {Invasion ecology offers a unique opportunity to examine drivers of
   ecological processes that regulate communities. Biotic resistance to
   nonindigenous species establishment is thought to be greater in
   communities that have not been disturbed by human activities.
   Alternatively, invasion may occur wherever environmental conditions are
   appropriate for the colonist, regardless of the composition of the
   existing community and the level of disturbance. We tested these
   hypotheses by investigating distribution of the nonindigenous amphipod,
   Echinogammarus ischnus Stebbing, 1899, in co-occurrence with a
   widespread amphipod, Gammarus fasciatus Say, 1818, at 97 sites across
   the Laurentian Great Lakes coastal margins influenced by varying types
   and levels of anthropogenic stress. E. Ischnus was distributed
   independently of disturbance gradients related to six anthropogenic
   disturbance variables that summarized overall nutrient input, nitrogen,
   and phosphorus load carried from the adjacent coastal watershed,
   agricultural land area, human population density, overall pollution
   loading, and the site-specific dominant stressor, consistent with the
   expectations of regulation by general environmental characteristics. Our
   results support the view that the biotic facilitation by dreissenid
   mussels and distribution of suitable habitats better explain E. ischnus'
   distribution at Laurentian Great Lakes coastal margins than
   anthropogenic disturbance.},

Abstract = {The zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha was introduced to North America
   during the mid-1980s, and is now a dominant member of many benthic
   communities in the lower Great Lakes. In this study, I explored the
   abundance, biomass, size structure and settlement of Dreissena
   inhabiting rocks along a wave-swept disturbance gradient near Middle
   Sister Island in western Lake Erie. Ten rocks were collected from
   quadrats at six sites along each of three transect lines oriented
   perpendicular to shore. Occurrence, abundance and biomass of Dreissena
   on smaller, movable rocks were positively associated with rock distance
   from shore (similar to lake depth) and with rock area; rocks at
   nearshore sites supported little, if any, Dreissena, whereas those at
   offshore sites were heavily colonized. Mussel size distributions also
   differed in relation to shore distance. Large mussels (greater than or
   equal to 19 mm) were underrepresented or absent on rocks collected at
   nearshore sites, but were overrepresented at offshore locations (greater
   than or equal to 37 m). Settlement of larval mussels on settling pads
   was positively correlated with distance offshore and with time of
   exposure, though settlement was substantial even at a nearshore (10 m)
   location. Area-adjusted mussel dry mass increased more rapidly with
   distance offshore on large than on small rocks. Large rocks also
   required more force to displace and were significantly less likely to be
   disturbed when transplanted at the study site. Results from this study
   indicate that occurrence, abundance and size structure of Dreissena in
   nearshore waters of Lake Erie correspond with the frequency of habitat
   disturbance, though other factors including food limitation and larval
   supply may also contribute to these patterns. These patterns complement
   studies that established the significance of physical disturbance in
   other aquatic systems.},

Abstract = {Early detection of invasive species is critical for effective biocontrol
   to mitigate potential ecological and economic damage. Laser transmission
   spectroscopy (LTS) is a powerful solution offering real-time, DNA-based
   species detection in the field. LTS can measure the size, shape and
   number of nanoparticles in a solution and was used here to detect size
   shifts resulting from hybridization of the polymerase chain reaction
   product to nanoparticles functionalized with species-specific
   oligonucleotide probes or with the species-specific oligonucleotide
   probes alone. We carried out a series of DNA detection experiments using
   the invasive freshwater quagga mussel (Dreissena bugensis) to evaluate
   the capability of the LTS platform for invasive species detection.
   Specifically, we tested LTS sensitivity to (i) DNA concentrations of a
   single target species, (ii) the presence of a target species within a
   mixed sample of other closely related species, (iii) species-specific
   functionalized nanoparticles versus species-specific oligonucleotide
   probes alone, and (iv) amplified DNA fragments versus unamplified
   genomic DNA. We demonstrate that LTS is a highly sensitive technique for
   rapid target species detection, with detection limits in the picomolar
   range, capable of successful identification in multispecies samples
   containing target and non-target species DNA. These results indicate
   that the LTS DNA detection platform will be useful for field application
   of target species. Additionally, we find that LTS detection is effective
   with species-specific oligonucleotide tags alone or when they are
   attached to polystyrene nanobeads and with both amplified and
   unamplified DNA, indicating that the technique may also have versatility
   for broader applications.},

Title = {Significant ecosystem-wide effects of the swiftly spreading invasive
   freshwater bivalve Limnoperna fortunei},
Journal = {HYDROBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {636},
Number = {1},
Pages = {271-284},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Since its introduction in South America around 1990, the freshwater
   Asian mussel Limnoperna fortunei has been shown to strongly interact
   with several components of the local biota. However, investigation of
   its ecosystem-wide effects was hindered by (1) difficulties associated
   with evaluation of its densities over large spatial scales and (2)
   scarcity of pre-invasion environmental data. The present survey
   overcomes these shortcomings and addresses the question whether
   Limnoperna's impact on the ecosystem-wide scale is measurable and
   significant. On the basis of diver-collected bottom samples, we
   estimated the overall density of this mussel in a reservoir (Embalse de
   Rio Tercero, Argentina), where Limnoperna is present since 1998 and
   analyzed changes in several water-column properties before and after the
   invasion. The 47 km(2) reservoir hosts around 45 billion mussels; at
   these densities, a volume equivalent to that of this water body can
   potentially be filtered by the bivalves every 2-3 days. Data collected
   regularly since 1996 indicate that after the invasion water transparency
   increased, and suspended matter, chlorophyll a, and primary production
   decreased significantly, with strong changes occurring in the area with
   highest mussel densities. Our results indicate that the ecosystem-wide
   impacts of Limnoperna are generally comparable to those described in
   Europe and North America for another invasive mussel-Dreissena
   polymorpha. However, given Limnoperna's wider tolerance limits, its
   influence on newly invaded water bodies, potentially including Europe
   and North America, will probably be stronger.},

Abstract = {The St. Lawrence estuarine transition zone (ETZ) is a productive
   ecosystem supporting a larval fish nursery. Since 1994, Dreissena
   polymorpha veligers have become the dominant zooplankton (up to 260
   individuals.L-1). The environmental factors controlling their
   distribution across the ETZ and their potential impact on the plankton
   were determined. Their horizontal distribution was limited by salinity,
   with maximum decreases in concentration at 2e. A sharp decline in prey
   availability at >2e may be a secondary stressor for the veligers, in
   addition to the direct effects of salinity. Their vertical distribution
   was homogeneous throughout the water column, even in the presence of a
   pycnocline. Redundancy analysis showed that veliger concentrations were
   positively correlated with temperature and turbidity and negatively
   correlated with salinity and total phosphorus. Veligers were also
   positively correlated with chlorophyll a and picophytoplankton
   concentrations, suggesting little effect on their phytoplankton prey.
   Moreover, the veligers were positively correlated with the sestonic
   ratio of particulate to total phosphorus, indicating their positive
   association with good food quality. The veligers appear to have no
   severe negative impacts on the ETZ plankton community and are restricted
   to favourable conditions for their survival in the upstream, low
   salinity region of the ETZ.},

Abstract = {Phytoplankton communities can experience nonlinear responses to changing
   nutrient concentrations, but the nature of species shifts within
   phytoplankton is not well understood and few studies have explored
   responses of pelagic assemblages in large lakes. Using pelagic
   phytoplankton data from the Great Lakes, we assessed phytoplankton
   assemblage change-point responses to nutrients and invasive Dreissena,
   characterising community responses in a multi-stressor environment and
   determine whether species responses to insitu nutrients can be
   approximated from nutrient loading. We demonstrate assemblage shifts in
   phytoplankton communities along major stressor gradients, particularly
   prominent in spring assemblages, providing insight into community
   thresholds at the lower end of the phosphorus gradient and
   species-stressor responses in a multi-stressor environment. We show that
   responses to water nutrient concentrations could not be estimated from
   large-scale nutrient loading data likely due to lake-specific retention
   time and long-term accumulation of nutrients. These findings highlight
   the potential for significant accumulation of nitrates in
   ultra-oligotrophic systems, nonlinear responses of phytoplankton at
   nutrient concentrations relevant to current water quality standards and
   system-specific (e.g. lake or ecozone) differences in phytoplankton
   responses likely due to differences in nutrient co-limitation and
   effects of dreissenids.},

Title = {First report on the uptake of automobile catalyst emitted palladium by
   European eels (Anguilla anguilla) following experimental exposure to
   road dust},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},

Volume = {113},

Abstract = {Following the introduction of automobile catalysts in the middle of the
   1980s in Germany there is an increasing emission of the
   platinum-group-metals platinum, palladium (Pd) and rhodium. Still, it
   remains unclear if these metals are bioavailable for aquatic animals and
   to which extent they become accumulated by the aquatic biosphere.
   Because of analytical problems in detecting Pd in small biological
   samples the present investigation concentrates on the bioavailability of
   this metal. To answer the question of a Pd uptake by aquatic organisms
   experimental studies were conducted with European eels maintained in
   water containing road dust at a concentration of 10 kg/100 l. Following
   an exposure period of four weeks, samples of liver and kidney were
   analysed by total-reflection X-ray fluorescence analysis after
   co-precipitation of Pd with mercury. These experiments revealed an
   uptake of traffic related Pd by European eels which showed a mean liver
   Pd concentration of 0.18 +/-0.05 ng/g (wet wt.), whereas the Pd
   concentration in the kidney ranged below the detection limit. Thus, in
   this study we can demonstrate for the first time that automobile
   catalyst emitted Pd is bioavailable for aquatic animals. (C) 2001

Abstract = {Invasive bivalves are known to negatively impact aquatic ecosystems
   across the globe. Previous research has demonstrated invasive bivalves
   can shift nutrients from the water column to the sediment, harm native
   bivalves, and reduce phytoplankton biomass. However, bivalve effects
   vary with species and the region where the invasion occurs. Therefore,
   we used mesocosm experiments to examine the impact of invasive Corbicula
   fluminea on nutrient concentration and phytoplankton biomass in the
   water column of mesotrophic and eutrophic Puerto Rican reservoirs. We
   used four treatments to determine the effect of C. fluminea on the water
   column. We found C. fluminea did not have a significant effect on the
   ammonium, nitrate, or phosphorus concentration in either the mesotrophic
   or eutrophic mesocosm experiments. Additionally, C. fluminea presence
   did not significantly alter phytoplankton biomass, though Synedra
   dominated the phytoplankton community when C. fluminea were absent.
   While C. fluminea may not have caused an effect in the water column as
   it was potentially phytoplankton limited, the mesocosm experiment
   conditions reflect the natural environment, indicating phytoplankton
   limitation could be an issue in the reservoirs. Our findings suggest C.
   fluminea does not have a large effect on nutrient concentration or
   phytoplankton biomass in eutrophic and mesotrophic Puerto Rican
   reservoirs. This study represents the first effort to examine the
   effects of C. fluminea presence on the water column of a tropical
   reservoir.},

Title = {A review of ballast water management practices and challenges in harsh
   and arctic environments},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {20},
Number = {2},
Pages = {83-108},
Abstract = {Ballast water is carried by cruise ships, large tankers, and bulk cargo
   carriers to acquire the optimum operating depth of the propeller and to
   maintain maneuverability and stability. Recently, ballast water has been
   recognized as wastewater that is responsible for ocean pollution due to
   the worldwide transfer of non-indigenous species, pathogenic bacteria,
   and other pollutants via ballast water discharge. This poses serious
   environmental, ecological, and economic threats to both coastal
   communities and the marine environment. To address these negative
   impacts and concerns, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has
   codified and adopted a series of guidelines to minimize pollution and
   adverse effects caused by ballast water. A number of treatment
   technologies have been developed and applied in field practices to
   remove solids, particulates, organic pollutants, and organisms from
   ballast water, showing certain advantages and limitations. Many other
   management practices, such as ballast water exchange (BWE), shipping
   routes optimization, treatment process modeling, and risk assessment are
   in high demand to aid onboard treatment systems. However, knowledge and
   technical gaps still exist regarding the implementation of ballast water
   management practices especially in the context of arctic and harsh
   environments under changing climatic conditions. Records indicate that
   most coastal regions in the north have been invaded by unwanted species
   via ballast water discharge in the past decades. The North Atlantic and
   the Arctic Oceans have much colder climates and more extreme weather
   conditions than low latitudes. The discharge of untreated or less
   treated ballast water could cause much more severe damage to the local
   environment and hence pose higher risks to ecosystems and even human
   health, particularly in the context of climate change. Based on a
   comprehensive literature review, this study proposed a risk-based
   fuzzy-stochastic-interval programming decision support system to help
   eliminate environmental, ecological, as well as health threats from the
   discharge of ballast water, particularly in the north where weather,
   space, timing, maintenance, and cost are major concerns.},

Title = {Feeding competition between the native oyster Crassostrea virginica and
   the invasive mussel Mytella charruana},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {564},
Pages = {57-66},
Month = {FEB 3},
Abstract = {The sub-tropical mussel Mytella charruana has been reported as invasive
   along the southeast coast of the USA since 1986. This mussel has been
   found to negatively impact the keystone species in its invaded range,
   the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica. To date, however, no mechanism
   for this negative impact has been determined. To elucidate the role of
   the invasive mussel on economically important oyster reefs, we compared
   the feeding of both species in a lagoon along the east coast of Florida
   (USA). Three different methodologies were used: (1) in situ
   filter-feeding experiments using the biodeposition method to estimate
   feeding behavior; (2) laboratory assays to estimate the depletion of
   bacterial particles using a flow cytometer; and (3) stable isotope
   analysis in conjunction with ellipse-based metrics to investigate the
   niche size and overlap of these 2 species. The in situ filter-feeding
   experiments revealed that, compared to C. virginica, M. charruana had
   significantly higher clearance, filtration, rejection, organic
   ingestion, and ab sorption rates, as well as higher rejection percentage
   and absorption efficiency, but rejected the same amount of inorganic
   particles. Flow cytometry data suggested that bacteria were a food
   source for both bivalve species. Stable isotope values confirmed that M.
   charruana and C. virginica filled similar functional niches in this
   ecosystem. These results suggest that M. charruana can out-compete
   native oysters; the findings also demonstrate that an invasion of M.
   charruana might significantly alter plankton abundance, potentially
   limiting food sources available to other less efficient native
   filter-feeders such as clams.},

Title = {Phase synchronization of chlorophyll and total phosphorus oscillations
   as an indicator of the transformation of a lake ecosystem},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 13},
Abstract = {The ecosystem of the Naroch Lakes (Belarus) includes three water bodies,
   Lake Batorino, Lake Myastro and Lake Naroch. These lakes have a common
   catchment area. At the end of the 80 s, the ecosystem of the Naroch
   Lakes underwent a transformation, during which the nutrient load on the
   catchment area decreased, and the concentration of phosphorus as a
   limiting factor in these water bodies decreased significantly. At the
   same time, the Naroch Lakes were exposed to zebra mussel (Dreissena
   polymorpha Pallas) invasion. In the mid-90 s, the biological and
   hydrochemical characteristics of the ecosystem of the Naroch Lakes
   stabilized. We show here that complex processes associated with the
   transformation of the lake ecosystem and affecting both trophic
   interactions in the Naroch Lakes and the influence of environmental
   factors on them can be represented using a single parameter, the
   phase-locking index, PLI. In this case, a statistically significant
   numerical value of PLI characterizes the phase synchronization of two
   processes, oscillations of the concentration of total phosphorus, TP,
   and oscillations of the concentration of chlorophyll, Chl. We show that
   the phase synchronization of these processes occurs only after the
   stabilization of the ecosystem of the Naroch Lakes. In the period
   preceding the transformation of the lake ecosystem, there was no
   synchronization. Numerical evaluation of PLI as a holistic parameter
   allows us to characterize the transformation of the lake ecosystem as a
   whole without resorting to study of complex interactions of various
   factors involved in this transformation.},

Abstract = {Tolerance towards environmental stress has been frequently considered as
   one of the key determinants of invasion success. However, empirical
   evidence supporting the assumption that invasive species can better
   endure unfavorable conditions compared with native species is limited
   and has yielded opposing results. In this study, we examined the
   tolerance to different stress conditions (thermal stress and trace metal
   zinc pollution stress) in two phylogenetically related and functionally
   similar freshwater bivalve species, the native Anodonta anatina and the
   invasive Sinanodonta woodiana. We assessed potential differences in
   response to stress conditions using several cellular response assays:
   efficiency of the multixenobiotic resistance mechanism, respiration
   estimate (INT reduction capacity), and enzymatic biomarkers. Our results
   demonstrated that the invasive species overall coped much better with
   unfavorable conditions. The higher tolerance of S. woodiana was evident
   from (i) significantly decreased Rhodamine B accumulation indicating
   more efficient multixenobiotic resistance mechanism; (ii) significantly
   higher INT reduction capacity and (iii) less pronounced alterations in
   the activity of stress-related enzymes (glutathione-S-transferase,
   catalase) and of a neurotoxicity biomarker (cholinesterase) in the
   majority of treatment conditions in both stress trials. Higher tolerance
   to thermal extremes may provide physiological benefit for further
   invasion success of S. woodiana in European freshwaters, especially in
   the context of climate change. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Zooplanktophagy in the natural diet and selectivity of the invasive
   mollusk Limnoperna fortunei},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {Since the 1990s the Rio de La Plata basin has been widely colonized by
   the invader mollusk Limnoperna fortunei. In spite of a relatively
   well-developed knowledge of the biology and ecology of this mollusk, not
   much is known about its natural diet and possible food selectivity.
   Stomach contents of 120 specimens attached to the roots of Eichhornia
   crassipes, and available planktonic food sources, taken from seven
   representative environments of the Parana River floodplain, were
   analyzed. The diet consisted of 156 taxa with a wide size range (2-1,178
   mu m) and representing a great variety of organisms. Phytoplankton was
   dominant in abundance (98.6\% of the total diet), while zooplankton,
   mainly small cladocerans, was dominant in volume (67\% of the total
   diet). L. fortunei showed a positive food selectivity for organisms with
   limited escape ability and low to moderate size (Euglenophyta, Rotifera,
   Chydoridae and Bosminidae), and a negative selectivity for many algae.
   Therefore, the plankton community structure would be changed due to this
   differential predation pressure. These are the first observations about
   the feeding of L. fortunei upon zooplankton. The results of the present
   study agree, in general, with those of descriptive field studies and
   laboratory experiments on the effect of Dreissena polymorpha on
   zooplankton, but differ in some aspects. The differences suggest the
   possibility of different impacts on the ecosystem, and a probable
   complementary coexistence in potentially `invadable' environments.
   Ecological interaction between L. fortunei and the invasive hydrophyte
   Eichhornia crassipes suggests a possible synergistic effect on the
   distributional efficiency of the mollusk.},

Title = {Can a Rapid Underwater Video Approach Enhance the Benthic Assessment
   Capability of the National Coastal Condition Assessment in the Great
   Lakes?},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {55},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1446-1456},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Over 400 sites were sampled in the nearshore of the U.S. Great Lakes
   during the U.S. National Coastal Condition Assessment (NCCA) field
   survey in summer 2010. Underwater video images were recorded in addition
   to routine NCCA benthic assessment measures. This paper has two
   objectives: (1) to develop a process to evaluate video performance with
   acceptance criteria, exploring reasons for poor images, and (2) to use
   acceptable videos in an example application with invasive mussels,
   evaluating the enhancement potential of video to supplement traditional
   grab sampling. A standard hierarchical protocol was developed to rank
   video performance based on quality and clarity. We determined
   controllable and uncontrollable factors affecting video performance.
   Moreover, specific thresholds limiting video were identified: > 0.5/m
   for light extinction and > 3.5 A mu g/L for chlorophyll a concentration.
   To demonstrate the utility and enhancement potential of video sampling,
   observed dreissenid presence from excellent (221 of 362 videos) videos
   was compared with NCCA benthic taxonomy, in the context of the
   statistically based NCCA survey. Including video increased the overall
   area estimate of the U.S. Great Lakes nearshore with invasive mussels by
   about 15 \% compared to PONAR alone; 44 \% (7570 km(2)) of the surveyed
   region had mussels. The proportion of the nearshore area having mussels
   varied from low (3.5 \%) in Lake Superior to > 50 \% in the lower lakes.
   PONAR and video have unique strengths and weaknesses as sampling tools
   in the Great Lakes nearshore environment, but when paired were
   complimentary and thus provided a more thorough benthic condition
   assessment at lake and regional scales.},

Title = {Abiotic factors controlling the establishment and abundance of the
   invasive golden mussel Limnoperna fortunei},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Pages = {717-729},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Limnoperna fortunei (Bivalvia, Mytilidae), a freshwater bivalve native
   to Southern Asia, has been an invasive species in South America since
   1991. It spread upstream in the La Plata basin reaching the Paraguay
   River in the vicinity of the Pantanal wetland, Brazil, around 1998. The
   role of abiotic factors in controlling establishment and abundance of
   this species is not well known, making projections of its risk of
   further spread difficult. This study evaluates the importance of abiotic
   factors to L. fortunei populations established in rivers of the
   Pantanal, focusing on larval and juvenile densities and taking advantage
   of a wide range of seasonal variability in water temperature, flow,
   dissolved oxygen, and suspended material. Temperature, river stage
   (influencing several water characteristics) and water velocity are the
   main variables related to the larval and juvenile densities. In the
   Pantanal, environmental variables vary over a broader range compared
   with other South American locations, subjecting L. fortunei to oxygen
   depletion, low calcium, low pH, and high water velocity and suspended
   solids, associated with low chlorophyll a concentrations. The combined
   effect of several of these conditions may explain the relatively low
   densities in some Pantanal sites. However, they probably will not
   prevent the persistence of populations in the Pantanal and the eventual
   establishment of viable populations in upriver systems connected to the
   Pantanal. These results are pertinent not only to this species but also
   to other aquatic invasive invertebrates whose expansion may be limited
   by thermal extremes, episodic oxygen depletion, and waters that are too
   dilute or acidic for optimal biocalcification.},

Title = {Autochthonous or allochthonous resources determine the characteristic

Journal = {THEORETICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Ecosystem engineering, or the modification of physical environments by
   organisms, can influence trophic interactions and thus food web
   dynamics. Although existing theory exclusively considers engineers using
   autochthonous resources, many empirical studies show that they often
   depend on allochthonous resources. By developing a simple mathematical
   model involving an ecosystem engineer that modifies the physical
   environment through its activities, its resource, and physical
   environment modified by the engineer, we compare the effects of
   autochthonous and allochthonous resources on the dynamics and stability
   of community with ecosystem engineers. To represent a variety of real
   situations, we consider engineers that alter either resource
   productivity, engineer feeding rate on the resource, or engineer
   mortality, and incorporate time-lagged responses of the physical
   environment. Our model shows that the effects of ecosystem engineering
   on community dynamics depend greatly on resource types. When the
   engineer consumes autochthonous resources, the community can exhibit
   oscillatory dynamics if the engineered environment affects engineer's
   feeding rate or mortality. These cyclic behaviors are, however,
   stabilized by a slowly responding physical environment. When
   allochthonous resources are supplied as donor-controlled, on the other
   hand, the engineer population is unlikely to oscillate but instead can
   undergo unbounded growth if the engineered environment affects resource
   productivity or engineer mortality. This finding suggests that ecosystem
   engineers utilizing allochthonous resources may be more likely to reach
   high abundance and cause strong impacts on ecosystems. Our results
   highlight that community-based, compounding effects of trophic and
   physical biotic interactions of ecosystem engineers depend crucially on
   whether the engineers utilize autochthonous or allochthonous resources.},

   medium- and large-sized N. melanostomus and contributed to the diet to a
   minor extent. In addition to the variability between size classes, we
   found a high interannual variability in the prey species. Round goby in
   the Kiel Canal was characterised by relatively low asymptotic total
   length and high relative fecundity. An almost balanced sex ratio
   indicates the established status of the population. The highest spawning
   activity took place between May and the end of June. From our data,
   negative effects of round goby on native species due to competition for
   prey and habitat are more likely than due to direct predation on eggs or
   fry. Affected species with similar habitat requirements are for example
   small gobiids from the genus Pomatoschistus. As round goby occurs in
   high abundance, substantial changes of the Kiel Canal ecosystem seem
   possible and likely.},

Abstract = {Many large European rivers have undergone multiple pressures that have
   strongly impaired ecosystem functioning at different spatial and
   temporal scales. Global warming and other environmental changes have
   favored the success of invasive species, deeply modifying the structure
   of aquatic communities in large rivers. Some exogenous species could
   alter trophic interactions within assemblages by increasing the
   predation risk for potential prey species (top-down effect) and limiting
   the dynamics of others via resource availability limitation (bottom-up
   effect). Furthermore, large transboundary rivers are complex aquatic
   ecosystems that have often been poorly investigated so that data for
   assessing long-term ecological trends are missing. In this study, we
   propose an original approach for investigating long-term combined
   effects of global warming, trophic resource decrease, predation risk,
   and water quality variations on the trait-based structure of
   macroinvertebrate and fish assemblages over 26 yr (1985-2011) and 427-km
   stretch of the river Meuse (France and Belgium). The study of temporal
   variations in biological, physiological, and ecological traits of
   macroinvertebrate and fish allowed identifying community trends and
   distinguishing impacts of environmental perturbations from those induced
   by biological alterations. We provide evidence, for this large European
   river, of an increase in water temperature (close to 1 degrees C) and a
   decrease in phytoplankton biomass (-85\%), as well as independent
   effects of these changes on both invertebrate and fish communities. The
   reduction of trophic resources in the water column by invasive molluscs
   has dramatically affected the density of omnivorous fish in favor of
   invertebrate feeders, while scrapers became the major feeding guild
   among invertebrates. Macroinvertebrate and fish communities have shifted
   from large-sized organisms with low fecundity to prolific, small-sized
   organisms, with early maturity, as a response to increased predation
   pressure.},

Abstract = {The occurrence of Pt in environmental matrices is increasing since the
   introduction of automobile catalytic converters. Given that Pt is
   bioavailable and causes biological effects in plants and animals,
   respective biomonitoring programs are in high demand. But the analytical
   methods for conducting such programs have not yet been sufficiently
   established. Therefore, a study was carried out to develop a microwave
   digestion of biological samples, which allows a rapid determination of
   Pt by adsorptive cathodic stripping voltammetry. A high pressure
   microwave system was used and the digestion was performed in HNO(3) and
   HCI. After digestion the HNO(3) was evaporated with a microwave assisted
   vacuum concentration set. The study resulted in a procedural detection
   limit of 37.5 ngL(-1) and a relative standard deviation of 18\%. A
   recovery study resulted in a Pt loss below 5\%. The microwave assisted
   evaporation of HNO(3) performed satisfactorily and up to 500 mL of the
   sample solution could be used for the voltammetric measurements without
   any effect on the peak heights. A direct comparison of Pt concentrations
   conducted after microwave digestion and digestion by high pressure
   ashing showed similar values. However, these promising results were not
   persistent throughout the repeated analysis using the same Teflon
   vessels. The vessels did not endure the harsh conditions and due to
   aging processes the Pt loss consistently increased until Pt
   determination in environmental relevant concentrations became
   impossible. Quartz vessels could not be employed as an alternative to
   the Teflon vessels, due to a lack of compatibility with the vacuum
   concentration system. Consequently, the results of this paper show that
   there is a need for further development of more resistant Teflon
   materials. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The role of temperature and oxygen availability on the distribution of
   Corbicula largillierti},
Journal = {INVERTEBRATE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {139},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The invasiveness of Corbicula largillierti has been underestimated, but
   this bivalve is currently receiving more attention. The first study of
   the distribution of this species along one of the major basins of
   central Argentina showed that it was completely absent in the major
   central reservoir, but was present along its tributary and effluent
   rivers. Ten years later, this discontinuous distribution has not
   changed, despite the bivalve's high dispersion capacity. The main
   environmental differences between the reservoir and the rivers are that
   the former has finer sediment grain size, higher temperatures, and lower
   oxygen concentration during summer months. This study aimed to evaluate
   whether one of these factors could be limiting the distribution of C.
   largillierti. We assessed the metabolic response and burial behavior
   (under different grain sizes) of C. largillierti over 8 weeks at 30
   degrees C against a control condition at 20 degrees C. We also analyzed
   the oxygen consumption (vO(2)) as a function of environmental oxygen
   concentration (pO(2)) at 25 degrees C, estimating its metabolic
   regulation capacity (R). This showed the existence of an environmental
   oxygen concentration threshold (P-t) that could be an indicative of
   physiological limiting concentrations that compromise species survival
   and settlement. After 8 weeks at 30 degrees C, the metabolic rate of
   individuals of C. largillierti increased and their burial behavior was
   slightly compromised but mostly for coarser sediments. Concerning
   environmental oxygen availability, C. largillierti is an oxyconformer
   with a low R (39.9\%), a clear pattern of negative regulation, and a low
   P-t (48.4\% air saturation). The lack of any regulation capacity of C.
   largillierti under environmental oxygen limitations and the extremely
   low pO(2) at the bottom of the reservoir during summer months may
   explain its failure to colonize and survive there.},

Title = {Environmental modulation of reproductive activity of the invasive mussel
   Limnoperna fortunei: implications for antifouling strategies},
Journal = {AUSTRAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {34},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Limnoperna fortunei (Dunker, 1857) (Bivalvia) invaded Argentina through
   the Rio de la Plata estuary around 1990 and is presently established
   throughout five South American countries as a dominant component of the
   benthic fauna and a major nuisance for industry and power plants.
   Between 1997 and 2006 we monitored the reproductive activity of L.
   fortunei through weekly measurements of planktonic larvae in six South
   American water bodies: Rio de la Plata estuary, Parana and Carapachay
   rivers, Salto Grande, ItaipU and Embalse de Rio Tercero reservoirs. Mean
   larval densities varied between 4000 and 7000 individuals m-3; except in
   the reservoirs of ItaipU (450 ind. m-3) and Salto Grande (869 ind. m-3),
   where the mussel was first recorded shortly before our surveys, and
   upstream dispersal is limited (Salto Grande). In all cases, reproductive
   output decreases during the winter. At four of the six sites surveyed
   larval densities were comparatively high for 8.8-10.2 months per year. A
   lower food supply is possibly responsible for the shorter reproductive
   period of 5.9 months at Embalse. At Salto Grande, there is a
   well-defined mid-summer drop in larval numbers, coinciding with blooms
   of cyanobacteria. We propose that, in addition to temperature, two major
   factors may regulate the reproductive activity of L. fortunei: (i) the
   availability of food; and (ii) blooms of toxic cyanobacteria,
   significantly shortening the otherwise very long reproductive period.
   This information is important for the design of antifouling programmes
   involving the use of molluscicides, and has potential for reduced
   biocide use. These results provide supporting evidence for some
   fundamental ecological theories of invasions discussed here.},

Abstract = {Biological invasions involve complex interactions between social and
   environmental factors, challenging effective management. This study
   represents the invasion of Minnesota lakes by zebra mussels as a network
   of interactions and finds that using network metrics can guide effective
   management.
   Complex socio-environmental interdependencies drive biological
   invasions, causing damages across large spatial scales. For widespread
   invasions, targeting of management activities based on optimization
   approaches may fail due to computational or data constraints. Here, we
   evaluate an alternative approach that embraces complexity by
   representing the invasion as a network and using network structure to
   inform management locations. We compare optimal versus network-guided
   invasive species management at a landscape-scale, considering siting of
   boat decontamination stations targeting 1.6 million boater movements
   among 9,182 lakes in Minnesota, United States. Studying performance for
   58 counties, we find that when full information is known on invasion
   status and boater movements, the best-performing network-guided metric
   achieves a median and lower-quartile performance of 100\% of optimal. We
   also find that performance remains relatively high using different
   network metrics or with less information (median >80\% and lower
   quartile >60\% of optimal for most metrics) but is more variable,
   particularly at the lower quartile. Additionally, performance is
   generally stable across counties with varying lake counts, suggesting
   viability for large-scale invasion management. Our results suggest that
   network approaches hold promise to support sustainable resource
   management in contexts where modelling capacity and/or data availability
   are limited.},

Abstract = {A paradox of invasion biology is that even though native species are
   locally adapted to environmental conditions, nonnative species without
   this advantage often invade. Ecologists have advanced four main theories
   to explain why invaders are successful in some places and not others:
   biotic resistance, environmental resistance, human disturbance, and
   natural enemies. However, none of these theories alone can account for
   invasions by two trout species outside their native ranges in North
   America. Brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) are able to displace native
   cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii) in the inland western US, but are
   themselves displaced by nonnative rainbow trout (O. mykiss) in the
   southeastern US. An alternative hypothesis is that an interaction among
   zoogeography, evolutionary history, and environmental resistance from
   the natural flow regimes can account for this paradox. The nonnative
   species invade successfully at the southern edge of the ranges of the
   native species, which are farthest from their ancestral origins. Due to
   their evolutionary history, the native species are poorly adapted to the
   natural disturbance regime at the southern limit of their ranges, but
   the nonnative species are preadapted by chance due to theirs. This
   alternative hypothesis about the interaction between the historical
   contingency of evolution and environmental resistance should be more
   widely tested, to inform both invasion biology and the conservation of
   native trout.},

Title = {Comparative impact of two glyphosate-based formulations in interaction
   with Limnoperna fortunei on freshwater phytoplankton},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {85},
Pages = {575-584},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Although contamination and invasive species are two of the most relevant
   anthropogenic drivers affecting ecosystems, their joint impact on the
   environment has been poorly investigated. Glyphosate, directly or
   indirectly, contaminates freshwater systems which in turn may be invaded
   by the golden mussel Limnoperna fortunei. Under laboratory conditions,
   we studied the combined effect of technical-grade glyphosate, Roundup
   Max (R) and Glifosato Atanor (R), in scenarios with and without L.
   fortunei, on phytoplankton from Salto Grande Reservoir (Uruguay River,
   Argentina). We expected that the effects of the interaction on
   phytoplankton and water quality would vary with the form of herbicide
   applied. The assay was conducted for 14 days (TO using 3-L bottles as
   experimental units. Eight treatments were performed in triplicate: C:
   Control; M: mussel; G: technical grade glyphosate acid; R: Roundup Max
   (R); Glifosato Atanor (R); MG: mussel + technical-grade glyphosate acid,
   MA: mussel + Glifosato Atanor (R) and MR: mussel + Roundup Max (R). The
   active ingredient was applied at 6 ppm. The dissipation of glyphosate in
   water was 1.5-2.6 times higher in presence of mussels. Treatments G and
   A showed an increase in phytoplankton abundance, mainly the
   cyanobacteria Microcystis spp. with rised to 289\% and 639\% at Tf,
   respectively, relative to their values at Ti. Roundup Max (R) limited
   the growth of Microcystis spp., as its abundance decreased 59\% relative
   to Ti. L. fortunei reduced phytoplankton abundances at Tf. Evenness
   increased significantly in M, MG, MR and MA, while it decreased in G, R
   and A relative to C. The interaction of factors produced a significant
   synergistic increase in periphyton; periphytic chlorophyll a
   concentration was 0.81 +/- 0.02 mu g cm(-2) for MR; 0.09 +/- 0.02 mu g
   cm(-2) for MA and 0.02 +/- 0.01 mu g cm(-2) for MG. Limnoperna fortunei
   appeared as the driving force in the interaction. The assay described
   here allows for the rapid assessment of the impact of these types of
   agents on freshwater.},

Title = {Associations between corbiculid and unionid densities and distributions

Abstract = {Some corbiculids (bivalve clams in the genus Corbicula) are invasive,
   having spread nearly worldwide and are thought to impact native unionid
   mussels. To determine the density and distributional associations of
   invasive corbiculids co-occurring with native unionids, corbiculid clam
   and unionid mussel surveys were conducted at 122 sites in the Kalamazoo
   River catchment, Michigan, U.S.A. Unionid densities ranged from 0 to 97
   (x(-) = 7.45 +/- 15.38 SD) live unionids found per person hour while
   corbiculid densities varied from 0 to 0.24 (0.012 +/- 0.037) g/cm(3).
   Corbiculid distributions were clumped (Moran's I test: Index = 0.281, Z
   = 2.228, p = 0.026) and highest along the main branch of the river.
   Unionid distributions, both individual species and at family level, were
   found to be randomly distributed throughout the catchment (Moran's I
   test: Index = 0.343 to -0.022, Z = 1.913 to -0.118, p value = 0.056 to
   0.970). Overall, unionid species richness, as well as the distribution
   of 13 unionid species, were negatively associated with corbiculid
   density. Although corbiculids can inhabit the same river reaches with
   unionids, unionid species richness and densities may be negatively
   influenced by the presence of corbiculids. Although many species of
   unionids were negatively associated with corbiculid density, our
   research showed that they can co-exist in the same river reaches.
   Overall, unionids were positively correlated with corbiculids throughout
   the catchment, probably because the two groups have similar habitat
   requirements. It is therefore important to consider unionids and
   corbiculids concurrently in conservation planning and the management of
   invasive corbiculids.},

Title = {The spatio-temporal distribution of the Ponto-Caspian polychaete in the
   Lower Sector of the Danube River and in Danube Delta},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {28},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Several Ponto-Caspian species, such as dreissenid and mud shrimp species
   have become massive invaders in freshwater ecosystems of Europe and
   North America. In order to understand the ability of other Ponto-Caspian
   groups to expand and invade other regions, their occurrence and
   adaptation within areas that can act as a vector need to be understood.
   Several Ponto-Caspian polychaete species might be capable to become
   invasive as well. Understanding their ecological tolerances and
   distribution dynamics in waterways that link them to other regions is
   therefore imperative to acknowledge their invasive potential. In this
   study we examine the distribution patterns of three PC polychaete
   species in the Danube River and delta area in order to assess whether
   the region might be a corridor for these species to spread into central
   Europe and beyond. The results revealed that the three studied species
   greatly vary in distribution and environmental tolerances, but that two
   of the three show ecological tolerances and distribution range
   extensions that make them potentially very invasive. Our study provides
   a baseline for further distribution studies of PC polychaetes and
   details their habitat requirements. The possibility that the two
   Ponto-Caspian polychaete species could use the Danube corridor to
   realise a massive range extension is new and raises several conservation
   concerns. It is imperative to understand invasive potential and
   distribution dynamics in order to prepare effective measurements to
   limit spread of potentially harmful species, such as Ponto-Caspian
   mussels, mud shrimps and in this case polychaete. (c) 2021 The

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Pages = {459-473},

Abstract = {The frequency of dispersal of invertebrates among lakes depends upon
   perspective and spatial scale. Effective passive dispersal requires both
   the transport of propagules and the establishment of populations large
   enough to be detected. At a global scale, biogeographic patterns of
   cladoceran zooplankton species suggest that effective dispersal among
   continents was originally rare, but greatly increased in the past
   century with expanded commerce. Genetic analysis allows some
   reconstruction of past dispersal events. Allozyme and mitochondrial DNA
   comparisons among New World and Old-World populations of several exotic
   cladocerans have provided estimates for likely source populations of
   colonists, their dispersal corridors, and timing of earlier dispersal
   events. Detecting the Old-World tropical exotic Daphnia lumholtzi early
   in its invasion of North America has allowed detailed analysis of its
   spatial spread. Twelve years of collection records indicate a rapid
   invasion of reservoirs in the United States, by both regional spread and
   long-distance jumps to new regions. Combining landscape features with
   zooplankton surveys from south-central US reservoirs revealed higher
   colonization rates of D. lumholtzi at lower landscape positions, a
   result which can be explained by either greater propagule load or by
   higher susceptibility of these downstream reservoirs. Because invaded
   reservoirs provide a source of propagules for nearby floodplain ponds,
   the rarity of this species in ponds suggests limitation by local
   environments. Such analyses of invading species over multiple spatial
   scales allow a better understanding of ecological processes governing
   invasion dynamics.},

Title = {Salinity as a barrier for ship hull-related dispersal and invasiveness
   of dreissenid and mytilid bivalves},
Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {163},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The benthic stages of Dreissenidae and Mytilidae may be dispersed over
   long distances while attached to ship hulls. Alternatively, larvae may
   be transported by water currents and in the ballast and bilge water of
   ships and vessels. To gain insight into dispersal potential and habitat
   suitability, survival of the benthic stages of two invasive dreissenid
   species (Dreissena polymorpha and Mytilopsis leucophaeata) and one
   mytilid species (Mytilus edulis) chosen based on their occurrence in
   fresh, brackish and sea water, respectively, were tested in relation to
   salinity. They were exposed to various salinities in mesocosms during
   three long-term experiments at outdoor temperatures. Mussel survival was
   studied without prior acclimation, reflecting conditions experienced
   when attached to ship hulls while travelling along a salinity gradient
   from fresh or brackish water to sea water, or vice versa. Initially,
   mussels react to salinity shock by temporarily closing their valves,
   suspending ventilation and feeding. However, this cannot be maintained
   for long periods and adaptation to higher salinity must eventually
   occur. Bivalve survival was monitored till the last specimen of a test
   cohort died. The results of the experiments allowed us to distinguish
   favorable (f.: high tolerance) and unfavorable (u.: no or low tolerance)
   salinity ranges in practical salinity units (PSU) for each species, viz.
   for D. polymorpha 0.2-6.0 PSU (f.), 7.0-30.0 PSU (u.), for M.
   leucophaeata 0.2-17.5 PSU (f.), 20.0-30.0 PSU (u.) and for M. edulis
   10.5-36.0 PSU (f.), 0.2-9.0 and 40 PSU (u.). At the unfavorable
   salinities, all mussels died within 14 days of initial exposure with the
   exception of M. edulis (23-30 days). The maximum duration of survival of
   single specimens of D. polymorpha was 318 days at a salinity of 3.2 PSU,
   of M. leucophaeata 781 days at 15.0 PSU and of M. edulis 1052 days at
   15.0 PSU. The number of days survived was compared with the duration of
   actual ship voyages to estimate the real world survival potentials of
   species dependent of salinity changes, travel distances and durations.
   The conclusion is that salinity shocks during the trip were survived
   within the favorable salinity range but that the species tolerate only
   for a few weeks the unfavorable salinity range. This functions as a
   barrier for dispersal. However, at faster and more frequent shipping in
   the future salinity can become no longer very important as a dispersal
   barrier.},

Abstract = {Since 1995, Dikerogammarus Villosus SONVINSKI, a Ponto-Caspian amphipod
   species, has been invading most of Western Europe's hydrosystems. D.
   villosus geographic extension and quickly increasing population density
   has enabled it to become a major component of macrobenthic assemblages
   in recipient ecosystems. The ecological characteristics of D. villosus
   on a mesohabitat scale were investigated at a station in the Moselle
   River. This amphipod is able to colonize a wide range of substratum
   types, thus posing a threat to all freshwater ecosystems. Rivers whose
   dominant substratum is cobbles and which have tree roots along the banks
   could harbour particularly high densities of D. villosus. A relationship
   exists between substratum particle size and the length of the
   individuals, and spatial segregation according to length was shown. This
   allows the species to limit intra-specific competition between
   generations while facilitating reproduction. A strong association exists
   between D. villosus and other Ponto-Caspian species, such as Dreissena
   polymorpha and Corophium curvispinum, in keeping with Invasional
   Meltdown Theory. Four taxa (Coenagrionidae, Calopteryx splendens,
   Corophium curvispinum and Gammarus pulex) exhibited spatial niches that
   overlap significantly that of D. villosus. According to the predatory
   behaviour of the newcomer, their populations may be severely impacted.},

Title = {The effect of temperature and salinity on the survival of Mytilopsis
   leucophaeata larvae (Mollusca, Bivalvia): The search for environmental
   limits},

Abstract = {The brackish water mussel, Mytilopsis leucophaeata, is a rapidly
   expanding invasive bivalve in Europe with great biofouling capacities.
   Being a typical brackish water species with very broad habitat
   preferences and environmental limits, adults are extremely tolerant to
   fluctuations in temperature and salinity. The life cycle of mussels
   however, consists of two phases: (1) from fertilization until larval
   settlement they are pelagic, only protected by a larval soft shell and
   (2) after settlement, the individuals become benthic and develop a hard
   mytiliform shell. The fact that adult mussels can close their protective
   valves is the major reason why they are important fouling species and
   are difficult to remove once settled. Therefore, vulnerability of
   different larval life stages of M. leucophaeata to temperature and
   salinity was investigated during standardized acute 48 h experimental
   tests. In addition, the survival limits of the most vulnerable larval
   life stage were determined at different temperature-salinity
   combinations. Results indicated that larval stages show a differential
   vulnerability: 4 h old embryos were more vulnerable to changes in
   temperature and salinity than 2 day old larvae. Maximal survival of 4 h
   old embryos was found at 22 degrees C at salinity 15. Surrounding this
   optimum, conditions stayed good for survival in a rather wide range:
   only salinities of 0 and 25 and temperatures below 10 degrees C or above
   30 degrees C caused high embryonic mortality. Thus, even the most
   vulnerable larval stage in the life cycle of M. leucophaeata can be
   considered highly resistant to environmental conditions. Considering the
   broad environmental limits of adult as well as larval M. leucophaeata,
   we can expect this species to appear many brackish water bodies
   worldwide, with only colder regions potentially limiting its invasion
   success. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Marine pest incursions can cause significant ongoing damage to
   aquaculture, biodiversity, fisheries habitat, infrastructure and social
   amenity. They represent a significant and ongoing economic burden.
   Marine pests can be introduced by several vectors including aquaculture,
   aquarium trading, commercial shipping, fishing, floating debris, mining
   activities and recreational boating. Despite the inherent risks, there
   is currently relatively little routine surveillance of marine pest
   species conducted in the majority of countries worldwide. Accurate and
   rapid identification of marine pest species is central to early
   detection and management. Traditional techniques (e.g. physical sampling
   and sorting), have limitations, which has motivated some progress
   towards the development of molecular diagnostic tools. This review
   provides a brief account of the techniques traditionally used for
   detection and describes developments in molecular-based methods for the
   detection and surveillance of marine pest species. Recent advances
   provide a platform for the development of practical, specific, sensitive
   and rapid diagnosis and surveillance tools for marine pests for use in
   effective prevention and control strategies. Crown Copyright (C) 2010

Title = {Population Dynamics of Lake Ontario Lake Trout during 1985-2007},
Journal = {NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {31},
Number = {5},
Pages = {962-979},
Abstract = {Lake trout Salvelinus namaycush were extirpated from Lake Ontario circa
   1950 owing to commercial and recreational fishing, predation by sea
   lampreys Petromyzon marinus, and habitat degradation. Since the 1970s,
   substantial efforts have been devoted to reestablishing a
   self-sustaining population through stocking, sea lamprey control, and
   harvest reduction. Although a stocking-supported population has been
   established, only limited natural reproduction has been detected. Since
   the 1990s, surveys have indicated a continuing decline in overall
   abundance despite fairly static stocking levels. We constructed a
   statistical catch-at-age model to describe the dynamics of Lake Ontario
   lake trout from 1985 to 2007 and explore what factor(s) could be causing
   the declines in abundance. Model estimates indicated that abundance had
   declined by approximately 76\% since 1985. The factor that appeared most
   responsible for this was an increase in age-1 natural mortality rates
   from approximately 0.9 to 2.5 between 1985 and 2002. The largest source
   of mortality for age-2 and older fish was sea lamprey predation,
   followed by natural and recreational fishing mortality. Exploitation was
   low, harvest levels being uncertain and categorized by length rather
   than age. Accurate predictions of fishery harvest and survey catch per
   unit effort were obtained despite low harvest levels by using atypical
   data (e. g., numbers stocked as an absolute measure of recruitment) and
   a flexible modeling approach. Flexible approaches such as this might
   allow similar assessments for a wide range of lightly exploited stocks.
   The mechanisms responsible for declining age-1 lake trout survival are
   unknown, but the declines were coincident with an increase in the
   proportion of stocked fish that were of the Seneca strain and a decrease
   in the overall stocking rate. It is possible that earlier studies
   suggesting that Seneca strain lake trout would be successful in Lake
   Ontario are no longer applicable given the large ecosystem changes that
   have occurred subsequent to invasion by dreissenid mussels.},

Title = {Secondary spread of invasive species: historic patterns and underlying
   mechanisms of the continuing invasion of the European rockweed Fucus
   serratus in eastern North America},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Pages = {79-97},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Post-establishment spread of invasive species is a major determinant of
   their impact, but the spatial pattern and temporal rhythm of secondary
   spread are often poorly known or understood. Here we examine the spread
   of the European rockweed Fucus serratus over 1,500 km of shoreline after
   its initial discovery in Pictou, Nova Scotia (Canada) in 1868. Building
   upon earlier periodic surveys, we document the current distribution of
   this invader and provide a historic analysis of the invasion, including
   the integration of the recently-detected multiple introductions from
   Europe. The initial spread was rapid in the southern Gulf of St.
   Lawrence (6.0 km year(-1)), likely due to both natural spread in a
   favorable environment and the extensive regional shipping traffic at the
   time which linked Pictou to several key ports in eastern Canada and
   northeast USA. Later spread, especially along the Atlantic coast of Nova
   Scotia, was slower (recently 0.9 km year(-1)), but included several
   major jumps (similar to 50-500 km), undoubtedly due to human-mediated
   transport. Although the spatial extent of the invasion has increased
   over the past 140 years, it has experienced several remarkable events:
   apparent local extinctions of northern satellite populations, a major
   retraction (100-150 km) along the northwestern limits of its continuous
   range, and stalled invasions at several points and times during its
   southward progression. Distributional data suggest that this invader is
   excluding congeners in shallow zones and possibly kelp species in deeper
   zones. Genetic data from one contact zone showed hybridization with
   native F. distichus but no evidence for introgression in migrating F.
   serratus. Hybridization and several other reproductive traits likely
   contribute to the competitive dominance of the invader in this
   environment.},

Title = {Modelling the transport of sloughed cladophora in the nearshore zone of
   Lake Michigan},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {323},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {The invasion of dreissenid mussels has profoundly altered benthic
   physical environments and whole-lake nutrient cycling in the Great Lakes
   over the past several decades. The resurgence of the filamentous green
   alga Cladophora appears to be one of the consequences of this invasion.
   Sloughed Cladophora deteriorates water quality, fouls recreational
   beaches, and may contribute to outbreaks of avian botulism, which have
   been espe-cially severe in the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore
   (SLBE) region of Lake Michigan. To help determine the fate of sloughed
   Cladophora, a Lagrangian particle trajectory model was developed to
   track the transport of Cladophora fragments in the nearshore zone based
   upon a physical transport-mixing model. The model results demonstrate
   that the primary deposition sites of sloughed Cladophora within the SLBE
   region are mid-depth sites not far away from their initial growth area.
   Because of high algae production in the nearshore waters and limited
   exchange between the inner and outer bay, the shoreline beach of Platte
   Bay appears to be particularly vulnerable to fouling, with overall three
   times as many accumulated particles as those along the Sleeping Bear Bay
   and Good Harbor Bay. The results of this model may be used to guide
   regional environmental management initiatives and provide insights into
   the mechanisms responsible for avian botulism outbreaks. This model may
   also inform the development of whole-lake ecosystem models that account
   for nearshore-offshore interactions.},

Title = {Variable changes in zooplankton phenology associated with the
   disappearance of the spring phytoplankton bloom in Lake Michigan},
Journal = {FRESHWATER BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {67},
Number = {2},
Pages = {365-377},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Changes in seasonal cycles (i.e., phenology), can cause mismatches
   throughout aquatic food webs and often are used as the primary indicator
   of zooplankton response to environmental changes. However, zooplankton
   phenology has been largely overlooked in Lake Michigan despite the
   altered phenology of phytoplankton, including the disappearance of the
   offshore spring phytoplankton bloom following Dreissena mussel
   invasions. Multiple measures of phenology were evaluated for the major
   zooplankton groups in offshore southeastern Lake Michigan both before
   the loss of the spring bloom (1983-2003), and after the spring bloom had
   disappeared (2007-2019). Water temperatures in spring did not differ
   between time periods. Standardised biomass declined between time periods
   for all zooplankton groups in spring and for total zooplankton and the
   cladoceran Daphnia in the summer. Changes in zooplankton phenology
   varied across groups and depended on the phenological measures used.
   Month of peak biomass shifted later for all groups, but the central
   point of the growing season did not change for any group between time
   periods. The onset of population development was delayed only for the
   copepod Limnocalanus. Spring chlorophyll concentrations combined with
   spring water temperatures provided the best predictions of population
   onset for Limnocalanus and Daphnia. The central point of the growing
   season varied with spring chlorophyll concentrations for Limnocalanus,
   but with spring water temperature for Daphnia. Changes in zooplankton
   phenology were relatively subtle compared to the large changes observed
   for spring chlorophyll concentrations. By contrast, there were fairly
   consistent declines in zooplankton biomass across groups that were
   associated with the declines in spring chlorophyll either alone or in
   combination with spring water temperature. This may mean that food
   limitation has a stronger influence on zooplankton biomass or production
   than on zooplankton phenology in offshore Lake Michigan. Based on our
   results from Lake Michigan, alterations such as nutrient reduction or
   invasive dreissenid mussel filtering that lead to declines in spring
   phytoplankton blooms in other large freshwater lakes could result in
   subtle delays in zooplankton phenology for some groups along with
   stronger declines in zooplankton biomass.},

Pages = {148-164},

Note = {21st International Conference on Aquatic Invasive Species (ICAIS),
   Montreal, CANADA, OCT, 2019},
Abstract = {Decontaminating recreational watercraft, and fishing, sailing or
   watersports equipment after use can reduce the overland dispersal of
   aquatic invasive species (AIS) among lakes. Recommended methods include
   pressure-washing, rinsing with hot water, using cleaning agents, or
   air-drying, but the extent of their efficacy is unknown. The aim of this
   review is to assess the effectiveness of current decontamination
   measures for recreational watercraft against various AIS. Web of
   Science, Greenfile, Environment Complete and Geobase were searched for
   articles published through September 2019. Studies on preventing
   overland AIS spread, and plant and invertebrate AIS response to hot
   water, pressure-washing, desiccation or cleaning agents, were selected.
   Of 37 studies included in the review, the majority (70.3\%) assessed
   air-drying, followed by hot water (32.4\%), household chemicals
   (16.2\%), and pressure-washing (2.7\%). The recommended air-drying
   duration of up to one week produced high mortality (>= 90\%) among
   several invertebrate and macrophyte species, although survival was high
   for certain aquatic snails. Larger and/or older invertebrates were more
   resistant to desiccation. Aquatic plant survival and growth were
   inversely related to water loss (a function of drying time and relative
   humidity), and short or single fragments were less resistant to
   air-drying than larger or clustered fragments. Immersion in water >= 50
   degrees C for 15 minutes resulted in 100\% mortality among mussels,
   small invertebrates and some plant species. A higher temperature of 60
   degrees C was required for hot water spray applications lasting >= 5
   seconds to achieve the same mortality rate among dreissenid mussels.
   High pressure-washing eliminated significantly more entangled plants,
   and small organisms and seeds than low pressure. Household chemicals
   such as salt or bleach required specific doses and immersion durations
   to be lethal to small organisms. This review reveals that current
   decontamination methods may be effective, but their efficacy against a
   diversity of AIS, including those on watch lists, are not yet
   well-understood. As the literature is currently skewed towards studies
   on air-drying, which has limited efficacy, further research is required
   to evaluate practical, and alternate or combined measures to best inform
   management practices.},

Title = {Effects of environmental factors on the distribution of the exotic
   species Mytilopsis sallei (Recluz, 1849) (Bivalvia: Dreissenidae) on the
   Northeast coast of Brazil},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {165},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The invasive bivalve Mytilopsis sallei caused several economic and
   ecological impacts in Asia. In Brazil, M. sallei was first reported in
   2004, and thus far, little is known about its ecological impact on
   Brazilian estuaries. The present study aims to evaluate the abundance
   and distribution of M. sallei and to analyse the environmental factors
   that led to the establishment of this species in a Brazilian Northeast
   estuary. Sampling was carried out in six stations along the estuary,
   covering a broad spectrum of salinities. Results showed that M. sallei
   was the most abundant benthic species in this estuary, although it was
   not broadly distributed, occurring only in one station (S1), the most
   polluted and the one with the lowest salinities (mean 17.3 +/- 11.56),
   which was the abiotic factor controlling the distribution of M. sallei.
   This station also had the lowest diversity of species (H' = 0.3269). The
   main M. sallei microhabitat was the pneumatophores roots from mangrove
   trees and decomposing wood. Despite the high abundance of M. sallei in
   S1, this species experienced negative effect of other benthic species
   suggesting that its distribution was limited by the high abundance of
   native species in other stations. Our results suggest that the
   distribution of M. sallei is influenced by a set of characteristics:
   preference for low salinity, favourable substrate type, tolerance to
   pollutants, and less direct competitors. Understanding how invasive
   species are distributed and relate to native species will provide more
   robust strategies to help maintain environmental health that ultimately
   will prevent the expansion of M. sallei population.},

Title = {Unveiling the Ecological Applications of Ancient DNA From Mollusk Shells},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {MAR 3},
Abstract = {The shells of marine mollusks represent promising metagenomic archives
   of the past, adding to bones, teeth, hairs, and environmental samples
   most commonly examined in ancient DNA research. Seminal work has
   established that DNA recovery from marine mollusk shells depends on
   their microstructure, preservation and disease state, and that authentic
   ancient DNA could be retrieved from specimens as old as 7,000 years.
   Here, we significantly push the temporal limit for shell DNA recovery to
   >= 100,000 years with the successful genetic characterization of one
   Portlandia arctica and one Mytilus mussel sample collected within a
   dated permafrost layer from the Taimyr Peninsula, Russia. We expand the
   analysis of ancient DNA in carbonate shells to a larger number of genera
   (Arctica, Cernuella, Crassostrea, Dreissena, Haliotis, Lymnaea,
   Margaritifera, Pecten, Ruditapes, Venerupis) from marine, freshwater and
   terrestrial environments. We demonstrate that DNA from ancient shells
   can provide sufficient resolution for taxonomic, phylogenetic and/or
   population assignment. Our results confirm mollusk shells as long-term
   DNA reservoirs, opening new avenues for the investigation of
   environmental changes, commercial species management, biological
   invasion, and extinction. This is especially timely in light of modern
   threats to biodiversity and ecosystems.},

Title = {Evidence for interactions among environmental stressors in the
   Laurentian Great Lakes},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {101},
Pages = {203-211},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Co-occurrence of environmental stressors is ubiquitous in ecosystems,
   but cumulative effects are difficult to predict for effective indicator
   development. Individual stressors can amplify (synergies) or lessen
   (antagonisms) each other's impacts or have fully independent effects
   (additive). Here we use the Laurentian Great Lakes, where a multitude of
   stressors have been studied for decades, as a case study for considering
   insights from both a systematic literature review and an expert
   elicitation (or structured expert judgment) to identify stressor
   interactions. In our literature search for pairs of stressors and
   interaction-related keywords, relatively few studies (9\%, or 6/65)
   supported additive interactions with independent stressor effects.
   Instead, both antagonisms (42\%, or 27/65) and synergies (49\%, or
   32/65) were common. We found substantial evidence for interactions of
   invasive dreissenid mussels with nutrient loading and between pairs of
   invasive species (predominantly dreissenids x round goby), yet both sets
   of records included mixtures of synergies and antagonisms. Complete
   quantification of individual and joint effects of stressors was rare,
   but effect sizes for dreissenid mussels x nutrient loading supported an
   antagonism. Our expert elicitation included discussion in focus groups
   and a follow-up survey. This process highlighted the potential for
   synergies of nutrient loading with dreissenid mussels and climate change
   as seen from the literature review. The elicitation also identified
   additional potential interactions less explored in the literature,
   particularly synergies of nutrient loading with hypoxia and wetland
   loss. To stimulate future research, we built a conceptual model
   describing interactions among dreissenid mussels, climate change, and
   nutrient loading. Our case study illustrates the value of considering
   results from both elicitations and systematic reviews to overcome data
   limitations. The simultaneous occurrence of synergies and antagonisms in
   a single ecosystem underscores the challenge of predicting the
   cumulative effects of stressors to guide indicator development and other
   management and restoration decisions.},

Abstract = {Shallow urban lakes are inherently variable due to their unpredictable
   mixing regime and often rapid response to the external environment. They
   therefore present a number of challenges to water managers seeking to
   improve water quality. Salford Quays (8.14 ha, depth = 6.6 m), Greater
   Manchester, UK is an example of a managed artificial shallow urban water
   body that provides a number of ecosystem services but in the past was
   one of the most polluted areas of water in the UK. Here we examine the
   long-term dataset (1985-2010) associated with restoration and document
   changes of several orders of magnitude in both phosphorus and
   chlorophyll-a. Three distinct phases of phytoplankton community
   succession were identified over the restoration period: cyanobacterial
   dominance, an abundance of larger chlorophytes and finally a
   preponderance of r-selected taxa such as nanoplankters and cryptomonads.
   We show that these phases relate to changes in limitation from
   photolimitation to increased zooplankton grazing and, finally, the
   combined effects of low nutrients and filter feeding by the invasive
   bivalve Dreissena polymorpha. Owing to water column mixing and the lack
   of a littoral zone in the main basins, Salford Quays will be relatively
   unaffected by confounding variables such as stratification and therefore
   offers an insight into the processes of community change in similar
   artificial and heavily modified natural systems elsewhere. In addition
   the Quays offer an excellent case study of urban water management and
   serves as an example both of best practice and a target ecosystem to
   direct the restoration of other urban waterways.},

   result of astronomical forcing},
Journal = {BIOGEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {10},
Number = {12},
Pages = {8423-8431},
Abstract = {Human induced range expansions of invasive dreissenid bivalves are of
   great concern. However, the underlying biological processes are only
   poorly understood, partly due to the lack of information on natural
   expansion events. Here we use the extinct bivalve species Sinucongeria
   primiformis as a model organism for testing natural (i.e.
   pre-Anthropocene) blooms of dreissenid species in a lacustrine system of
   Lake Pannon during the Tortonian (similar to 10.5 Myr; late Miocene). A
   total of 600 samples from a consecutive core were evaluated for the
   relative abundance of this pavement-forming mollusc, which cover about
   eight millennia of late Miocene time with a decadal resolution.
   Our data indicate that the settlement by bivalves in the offshore
   environment was limited mainly by bottom water oxygenation, which
   follows predictable and repetitive patterns through time. These
   population fluctuations might be related to solar cycles: successful
   dreissenid settlement is recurring in a frequency known as the lower and
   upper Gleissberg cycles with 50-80 and 90-120 yr periods. These cycles
   appear to control regional wind patterns, which are directly linked to
   water mixing of the lake. This is modulated by the even more prominent
   500 yr cycle, which seems to be the most important pacemaker for Lake
   Pannon hydrology.},

   Clam Corbicula fluminea},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 2},
Abstract = {Temperature is a determinant environmental variable in metabolic rates
   of organisms ultimately influencing important physiological and
   behavioural features. Stressful conditions such as increasing
   temperature, particularly within high ranges occurring in the summer,
   have been suggested to induce flotation behaviour in Corbicula fluminea
   which may be important in dispersal of this invasive species. However,
   there has been no experimental evidence supporting this hypothesis. It
   was already proven that C. fluminea drift is supported by a mucilaginous
   drogue line produced by mucocytes present in the ctenidia. Detailed
   microscopic examination of changes in these cells and quantification of
   clam flotation following one, two and three weeks of exposure to 22, 25
   and 30 degrees C was carried out so that the effects of increasing water
   temperatures in dispersal patterns could be discussed. Results show that
   changes in temperature triggered an acceleration of the mucocytes
   production and stimulated flotation behaviour, especially following one
   week of exposure. Dilution of these effects occurred following longer
   exposure periods. It is possible that these bivalves perceive changing
   temperature as a stress and respond accordingly in the short-term, and
   then acclimate to the new environmental conditions. The response
   patterns suggest that increasing water temperatures could stimulate C.
   fluminea population expansion.},

Title = {Native Dreissena freshwater mussels in the Balkans: in and out of
   ancient lakes},
Journal = {BIOGEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {7},
Number = {10},
Pages = {3051-3065},
Abstract = {The Balkans is a biogeographically highly diverse region and a worldwide
   hotspot of endemic freshwater diversity. A substantial part of this
   diversity is attributed to well recognized and potential ancient lakes
   in its southwestern part. However, despite considerable research
   efforts, faunal relationships among those lakes are not well understood.
   Therefore, genetic information from native representatives of the mussel
   genus Dreissena is here used to test the biogeographical zonation of the
   southwestern Balkans, to relate demographic changes to environmental
   changes, to assess the degree of eco-insularity, to reconstruct their
   evolutionary history, and to explore the potential of native taxa for
   becoming invasive.
   Phylogeographical and population genetic analyses indicate that most
   studied populations belong to two native species: D. presbensis
   (including the distinct genetic subgroup from Lake Ohrid, ``D.
   stankovici{''}) and D. blanci. In addition, the first confirmed record
   of invasive D. polymorpha in the southwestern Balkan is presented.
   The distribution of native Dreissena spp. generally coincides with the
   biogeographical zonations previously suggested based on fish data.
   However, there is disagreement on the assignment of the ancient lakes in
   the area to respective biogeographical regions. The data for Lake Ohrid
   are not conclusive. A closer biogeographical connection to lakes of the
   Vardar region and possibly the northern Ionian region is, however,
   suggested for Lake Prespa.
   The reconstruction of the evolutionary history of Dreissena spp.
   suggests that populations underwent demographic and spatial expansions
   in the recent past. Expansions started around 320 000-300 000 years ago
   in ``D. stankovici{''}, 160 000-140 000 years ago in D. blanci, and 110
   000-70 000 years ago in D. presbensis. These time frames are discussed
   within the context of available paleogeological data for lakes Ohrid and
   Prespa. It is suggested that regional environmental changes may have had
   pronounced effects on the population histories of native Dreissena spp.,
   though the high buffer capacity of Lake Ohrid may have lessened these
   effects in ``D. stankovici{''}. In addition, local events influencing
   individual lakes had very likely considerable effects on the demographic
   histories of Dreissena spp. as well. The observed patterns of
   immigration and emigration in and out of ancient lakes may suggest that
   limited gene flow enabled the survival of few isolated subpopulations
   and that later on eco-insularity (selective advantages of locally
   adopted groups) may have prevented excessive hybridization and sympatry
   of closely related taxa.
   As for the potential invasiveness of native Dreissena spp., the inferred
   spatial expansions are not human-mediated and all taxa still appear to
   be restricted to their native ranges. A concern, however, is that today
   D. presbensis and D. blanci also occur in artificial water bodies, and
   that invasive D. polymorpha has reached the area.},

Title = {Linking environmental warming to the fitness of the invasive clam
   Corbicula fluminea},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {15},
Number = {12},
Pages = {2838-2851},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Climate warming is discussed as a factor that can favour the success of
   invasive species. In the present study, we analysed potential fitness
   gains of moderate warming (3 degrees C above field temperature) on the
   invasive clam Corbicula fluminea during summer and winter. The
   experiments were conducted under seminatural conditions in a
   bypass-system of a large river (Rhine, Germany). We showed that warming
   in late summer results in a significant decrease in the clams' growth
   rates (body mass and shell length increase) and an increase in mortality
   rate. The addition of planktonic food dampens the negative effect of
   warming on the growth rates. This suggests that the reason for the
   negative growth effect of temperature increase in late summer is a
   negative energetic balance caused by an enhanced metabolic rate at
   limited food levels. Warming during early summer revealed contrasting
   effects with respect of body mass (no warming effect) and shell length
   (increased shell growth with warming). This differential control of both
   parameters further enhances the loss of the relative (size-specific)
   body mass with warming. In contrast, warming in winter had a
   consistently positive effect on the clams' growth rate as demonstrated
   in two independent experiments. Furthermore, the reproduction success
   (as measured by the average number of larvae per clam) during the main
   breeding period (April) was strongly enhanced by experimental warming
   during winter, i.e. by eight times during the relatively cold winter
   2005/2006 and by 2.6 times during the relatively warm winter 2007/2008.
   This strong, positive effect of moderate winter warming on the clams'
   fitness is probably one reason for the recent invasion success of C.
   fluminea in the northern hemisphere. However, warm summer events might
   counteract the positive winter warming effect, which could balance out
   the fitness gains.},
