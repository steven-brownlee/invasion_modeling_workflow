T1  - Modeling the Bioaccumulation and Biomagnification Potential of Microplastics in a Cetacean Foodweb of the Northeastern Pacific: A Prospective Tool to Assess the Risk Exposure to Plastic Particles
AN  - 2444733710
AB  - Microplastics (MPs) can readily be ingested by marine organisms. Direct ingestion and trophic transfer are likely to be the main pathway for microplastics to bioaccumulate in upper trophic level organisms. Bioaccumulation potential of MPs in marine mammalian foodwebs is scarcely known. To understand whether microplastics bioaccumulate in marine mammals, a bioaccumulation model for MPs was developed for the filter-feeding humpback whale and fish-eating resident killer whale foodwebs of the Northeastern Pacific. Applying three concentration scenarios for MPs by entering observed water and sediment concentrations as input data (low, high and moderate scenarios), and tested under two different elimination rates (kE) for zooplankton, the model predicted species-specific and foodweb-specific bioaccumulation potential. The predator-prey biomagnification factor (BMFTL, used to assess the ratio of the MP concentration in predator to that in prey adjusted to the difference of trophic levels), involving cetaceans, appeared to be not only lower than one or equal to one (BMFTL ≤ 1 as in resident killer whale/Chinook salmon), but also BMFTL > 1 in some predator-prey relationships (humpback whale/zooplankton). Depending on the magnitude of abiotic concentrations used in the modelling, the trophic magnification factor (TMF) regression analyses over time showed lack of evidence for trophic magnification as the magnification was independent of the trophic level, indicating no changes (TMF = 1; p>0.05), and trophic dilution (TMF<1; p<0.05) due to the decrease in MP concentrations as the trophic level increased. Projected biomagnification in simplified foodwebs revealed no significant increase in concentrations as the trophic level increased (TMF=1; p>0.05), following 100-365 days. Compared to the high biomagnification behaviour of persistent organic pollutants in marine foodwebs, scarce biomagnification capacity of microplastic was predicted in the cetacean foodwebs. Notwithstanding, the moderate to high microplastic bioaccumulation predicted in some lower trophic level marine organisms highlights the health risks of toxic exposure to marine fauna and coastal communities relying strongly on seafood. This modelling work provides a tool to assess the bioaccumulation potential and impact of microplastics in the marine environment to support risk assessment and inform plastic waste management.

T1  - Scope for growth of cultivated Pacific and Gulf of California populations of lion's paw scallop Nodipecten subnodosus, and their reciprocal transplants
AN  - 2447590812
AB  - In the present work, the relative effects of the season (early vs. late summer), site (Gulf vs. Pacific study sites), the population of origin (Gulf vs. Pacific) and associated abiotic variables were determined in two geographically-separated Nodipecten subnodosus populations and their reciprocal transplants, through the scope for growth (SFG) and net growth efficiency (K2) using a portable open-flow system. Results indicate that both energy acquisition and expenditure were significantly affected by season, site, and population factors. Scallop energy acquisition and growth efficiency were highest during the earlier, cooler part of the summer and higher at the Pacific site where food availability was highest. Significantly higher respiration rates were measured for the Pacific scallop population, leading to significantly lower net growth efficiency than scallops of Gulf origin, which indicates a physiological advantage for Gulf scallops during the suboptimal growth conditions present during summer months on both coasts of the Baja California peninsula. It may have important implications for aquaculture enterprises in this region, and may also confirm the genetic divergence between these two geographically separated populations. The advantages of the open-flow system for in situ ecophysiological studies in aquatic organisms are discussed.

T1  - Effects of Polyethylene Microplastics on Freshwater Oligochaeta <i>Allonais inaequalis</i> (Stephenson, 1911) Under Conventional and Stressful Exposures
AN  - 2439113482
AB  - The occurrence of microplastics in the aquatic environment has been reported around the world; however, their effects on freshwater oligochaetes are unknown. In this research, we investigated the toxic effects of polyethylene microplastics (MP), size between 40 and 48 μm, on the aquatic worm Allonais inaequalis. We applied the bioassays considering 24 °C as standard temperature and thermal stress of 19 °C and 29 °C, associated with the presence and absence of sediment in short-term and chronic exposures (96 h and 240 h, respectively). MP did not cause significant mortality in short-term exposures and did not affect the reproduction of worms. In addition, when we analyzed whether thermal stress, as well as substrate availability, would have an additional impact on MP toxicity, there were no significant effects. At 29 °C, the individuals reached the highest reproduction rates, whereas at 19 °C the offspring significantly reduced. Moreover, the lack of sediment substantially reduced survival rates after 96 h under 24 °C (p = 0.018). This paper also records for the first time, the ability of microplastic ingestion by a freshwater naidid. Due to its capacity to respond in a short period, adaptation to laboratory cultivation, and representativeness among freshwater aquatic invertebrates, A. inaequalis is presented as a tropical test organism for toxic effect analysis of microplastics, either in conventional exposures or simulated environmental disturbances.

T1  - Patterns of mitochondrial and microsatellite DNA markers describe historical and contemporary dynamics of the Humboldt squid <i>Dosidicus gigas</i> in the Eastern Pacific Ocean
AN  - 2431395405
AB  - Dosidicus gigas is an economically important species distributed in the Eastern Pacific Ocean. Unraveling the genetic population structure of this species is crucial to ensure its fishery sustainability and management. Mitochondrial DNA sequences and nuclear neutral loci are useful to understand how historical and contemporary factors drive the genetic population structure of species. However, most studies investigating genetic structuring of D. gigas from its northern and southern populations rely on patterns identified using mitochondrial genes. The use of both types of DNA markers is especially relevant for marine species with high dispersal capabilities such as D. gigas. Here, we describe the genetic structure of D. gigas using partial sequences of the mitochondrial gene NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 and nuclear microsatellite loci in populations of the northern hemisphere from the Costa Rica Thermal Dome and off Ecuador; and, of the southern hemisphere from the South Equatorial Current and off Peru. Statistical parsimony network and Bayesian analyses from mitochondrial sequences revealed three historical maternal lineages in both hemispheres, with high levels of genetic differentiation and signatures of population expansion during the late Pleistocene. Use of Discriminant Analysis of Principal Component (DAPC) with microsatellite loci of mature and immature individuals showed the presence of at least two contemporary genetic stocks homogeneously co-distributed in both northern and southern hemispheres, which can be explained by the biological characteristics of D. gigas and the variable oceanographic conditions of the Eastern Pacific Ocean. Overall, our findings indicate that cooperation between countries with intensive fishing will benefit the sustainability of D. gigas.

T1  - The effects of satiation level and competition risk on resource acquisition in red swamp crayfish (<i>Procambarus clarkii</i>)
AN  - 2429349798
AB  - Strategies of resource acquisition are subject to change due to introduced pressures placed upon individual animals. The pressures of food deprivation and competition can lead to a drastic change in previously established strategies of resource acquisition. We conducted a series of trials in which red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) were either deprived of food or satiated and competition was introduced via a plastic model to necessitate the abandonment of established resource acquisition strategies in favor of risk-insensitive strategies. Crayfish exhibited no difference in behavior when exposed to a singular pressure; however, an interaction between food deprivation and competition was detected and indicates that crayfish responded to food sources more quickly and with more risk-insensitive behavior when a model competitor was present. This combination of factors indicates a complex relationship between resource acquisition strategies and the pressures of acquiring food.

T1  - Predicting microcystin concentration action-level exceedances resulting from cyanobacterial blooms in selected lake sites in Ohio
AN  - 2423654433
AB  - Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms and the toxins they produce are a global water-quality problem. Monitoring and prediction tools are needed to quickly predict cyanotoxin action-level exceedances in recreational and drinking waters used by the public. To address this need, data were collected at eight locations in Ohio, USA, to identify factors significantly related to observed concentrations of microcystins (a freshwater cyanotoxin) that could be used in two types of site-specific regression models. Real-time models include easily or continuously-measured factors that do not require that a sample be collected; comprehensive models use a combination of discrete sample-based measurements and real-time factors. The study sites included two recreational sites and six water treatment plant sites. Real-time models commonly included variables such as phycocyanin, pH, specific conductance, and streamflow or gage height. Many real-time factors were averages over time periods antecedent to the time the microcystin sample was collected, including water-quality data compiled from continuous monitors. Comprehensive models were useful at some sites with lagged variables for cyanobacterial toxin genes, dissolved nutrients, and (or) nitrogen to phosphorus ratios. Because models can be used for management decisions, important measures of model performance were sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of estimates above or below the microcystin concentration threshold standard or action level. Sensitivity is how well the predictive tool correctly predicts exceedance of a threshold, an important measure for water-resource managers. Sensitivities > 90% at four Lake Erie water treatment plants indicated that models with continuous monitor data were especially promising. The planned next steps are to collect more data to build larger site-specific datasets and validate models before they can be used for management decisions.

T1  - Seasonal variation of microcystins and their accumulation in fish in two large shallow lakes of China
AN  - 2422265217
AB  - Bioaccumulation of microcystins (MCs) has been widely observed in aquatic vertebrates and invertebrates, but its seasonal and specific variations remain unclear. In the present study, dissolved MCs in water, algal cell-bound MCs and muscle tissue MCs of nine fish species were investigated monthly in two of the largest shallow lakes in China: Lake Taihu and Lake Chaohu. The fish species were grouped as carnivorous, planktivorous, and omnivorous fish. Seasonal variations in dissolved and algal cell-bound MCs in water and MCs contents of fish hepatopancreas and muscle were investigated in the two lakes from 2009 to 2010. Dissolved MCs in water ranged from 0.35 to 2.56 µg l−1 in Lake Taihu and 0.16 to 2.45 µg l−1 in Lake Chaohu, and showed seasonally a unimodal distribution. Algal cell-bound MCs also showed a similar seasonal variation in both lakes, but dissolved MCs in water peaked about one month later than algal cell-bound MCs. The MCs content in the Fish muscle was higher MCs from October to December than in the other months. For most of the fish species, it exceeded the tolerable daily intake value established by the WHO. The averaged MCs content in the muscle of carnivorous, planktivorous, omnivorous fish was 48.2, 28.7 and 37.8 μg kg−1 in Lake Taihu, respectively, and 27.8, 18.6 and 20.4 μg kg−1 in Lake Chaohu. It was significantly higher in carnivorous fish than in planktivorous and omnivorous fish, indicating that carnivorous fish has a higher exposure risk to the local people when consuming the harvested fish. The average ratio of hepatopancreas to muscle MCs contents was 13.0, 25.2, 13.8 for carnivorous, planktivorous, omnivorous fishes in Lake Taihu, respectively, and 18.0, 24.9, 14.8 in Lake Chaohu. These ratio for planktivorous fish almost doubled that for carnivorous and omnivorous fish. High correlation of MC content in carnivorous, omnivorous and planktivorous fish indicates that MCs can be delivered along trophic levels in the food chains.

T1  - Passive and grab sampling methods to assess pesticide residues in water. A review
AN  - 2416304234
AB  - There is actually health concern about the uncontrolled use of pesticides, as some banned pesticides continue to be used in many regions of the world, especially in Latin America. Advanced analytical methods are thus required to detect pesticides in water. Common pesticide analysis is done by grab sampling of water volumes ranging from milliliters to liters. Grab sampling is suitable for moderate to high pesticide concentrations, but fails to detect trace levels and shows only a single-time snapshot of pesticide levels. Alternatively, passive sampling extracts and collects water directly in situ, thus allowing time for pollutants to be accumulated into the sampler. Passive sampling has recently become a major tool for extraction of organic contaminants in surface water, groundwater and wastewater. Diverse pollutants have been studied, such as pesticides, illicit and prescription drugs, metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and cyanobacterial microcystin toxins. This review describes the main devices of passive sampling, used for the extraction of pesticides in waters.

T1  - Decreasing nitrogen loading and climate change promotes the occurrence of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria in a restored city lake
AN  - 2411431792
AB  - External loading reduction has been implemented to improve water quality in China since the 2000s. To evaluate the effects of nutrient reduction on phytoplankton, long-term monitoring data for Lake Wuli from 1998 to 2017 were analyzed. After the restoration since 2003, nitrogen decreased significantly from 8 to 2 mg/l until 2008 and then remained stable until 2017, while total phosphorus declined progressively from 0.2 mg/l to approximately 0.08 mg/l during 2003 and 2017. Biological data indicated that phytoplankton biovolume decreased after restoration until 2010 and then increased slightly from 2010 to 2017, mainly due to increasing of cyanobacterial biovolume. The dominant taxa shifted from cryptophyta to cyanobacteria since 2009. The results of both nonmetric multidimensional scaling and random forest regression showed that changes in nutrients, especially decreases in nitrogen, were the main drivers for phytoplankton community variation and increasing of cyanobacterial biovolume to the total phytoplankton biovolume ratio in summer and autumn. In addition to nutrients reduction, climatic variables such as wind speed decrease also played vital roles in increasing of cyanobacterial dominance in Lake Wuli. Our study confirmed that phytoplankton community respond strongly to nitrogen reduction in the subtropics and that climate change mediates the response.

T1  - Seasonal Variability in Benthic–Pelagic Coupling: Quantifying Organic Matter Inputs to the Seafloor and Benthic Macrofauna Using a Multi-Marker Approach
AN  - 2409767726
AB  - The exchange between the water column and the seafloor is a complex process, and is particularly intensive in the shallow waters of highly productive coastal areas, where the temporal variability in the inputs of pelagic organic matter will determine many aspects of the benthic community structure. However, few studies have focused on the seasonality of inputs of organic matter to the seafloor, and on the consequent dynamics and time scales of response of benthic consumers. We conducted a one-year study where we repeatedly sampled multiple organic compounds traditionally used as markers to study the link between the pelagic organic matter inputs and the seafloor, and the potential response of benthic macrofauna to seasonal trends in phytoplankton biomass. We simultaneously quantified the particulate organic matter in the water column, the sinking material and different seafloor compartments, and analysed it for pigments, organic carbon and nitrogen content, C/N ratio, and stable isotopes. Seafloor sediment was also analysed for total lipids, and the dominant macrobenthic species for isotopic signatures. Results showed a major deposition of fresh organic matter during the spring bloom followed by more degraded organic matter inputs during the late summer bloom and even lower quality of the organic matter reaching the seafloor during winter. Strong positive relationships between water column and sedimentary pigments suggest that phytoplankton was the main source of carbon to the seafloor. The isotopic signatures of the dominant macrobenthic species suggest a fast response to the organic matter inputs from the water column. However, different species responded differently to the deposition of organic matter. Macoma balthica and Marenzelleria spp. fed on more reworked and degraded sedimentary material, while Monoporeia affinis showed a shift in the feeding habits according to its life stage, with adult individuals feeding on fresher material than juveniles did. Our study highlights the seasonal variability of the benthic-pelagic coupling and the utility of a multi-marker approach to follow the temporal inputs of organic matter from the water column to the seafloor and benthic organisms.

T1  - Exploring New Frontiers in Marine Radioisotope Tracing – Adapting to New Opportunities and Challenges
AN  - 2408954067
AB  - Radioisotopes have been used in earth and environmental sciences for over 150 years and provide unique tools to study environmental processes in great detail from a cellular level through to an oceanic basin scale. These nuclear techniques have been employed to understand coastal and marine ecosystems via laboratory and field studies to understand how aquatic organisms respond to environmental stressors including temperature, pH, nutrients, metals, organic anthropogenic compounds and biological toxins. Global marine issues, such as ocean warming, deoxygenation, plastic pollution, ocean acidification, increased duration and intensity of toxic harmful algal blooms (HABs), and coastal contamination are all impacting marine environments, thereby imposing various environmental and economic risks. Being able to reliably assess the health of coastal and marine ecosystems, and how they may respond to future disturbances, can provide vital information for society in the sustainable management of their marine environments. This paper summarises the historical use of radiotracers in these systems, describes how existing techniques of radioecological tracing can be developed for specific current environmental issues and provides information on emerging issues that would benefit from current and new radiotracer methods. Current challenges with using radioecological tracers and opportunities are highlighted as well as opportunities to maximise the uptake of these methods to greatly increase the ability of environmental managers to conduct evidence-based management of coastal and marine ecosystems.

T1  - Assessment of Natural and Anthropogenic Radioactivity of the Princes’ Islands in the Sea of Marmara
AN  - 2404536380
AB  - In this study, the activity concentrations of naturally occurring 238U, 232Th and 40K and anthropogenic 137Cs radionuclides were measured for 56 soil and beach sand samples collected from the Princes’ Islands (Istanbul) in the Sea of Marmara, using a gamma-ray spectrometer. In each case, the outdoor gamma-ray dose rates in air were measured at the coordinates where the samples were collected, using a portable gamma-ray detector. In addition, the 210Po specific activity concentrations were measured for 13 different types of fish and 3 black mussel samples that are consumed in the region, using an alpha spectrometer. The mean activity concentrations of natural 238U, 232Th and 40K and artificial 137Cs radionuclides were calculated to be 33.8 ± 0.5 Bq kg−1, 19.3 ± 0.3 Bq kg−1, 429.5 ± 4.5 Bq kg−1 and 8.9 ± 0.1 Bq kg−1, respectively, in the soil and beach sand samples. Activity concentration contour maps of the Princes’ Islands (Istanbul) were constructed. The mean annual effective dose values for natural and artificial radioactive nuclide activity concentrations were determined to be 55.4 μSv y−1 and 1.2 μSv y−1, respectively. The average outdoor gamma-ray dose rate measured in the air was 0.68 mSv y−1. The mean activity concentrations of 210Po in the fish and mussel samples were measured to be 16.2 ± 1.9 Bq kg−1 and 516.1 ± 25.8 Bq kg−1. The average annual effective ingestion doses due to 210Po from the consumption of these seafoods were calculated to be 106.9 μSv y−1 and 619.4 μSv y−1, respectively. The results of this study were compared with the limits proposed by UNSCEAR, ICRP and the values obtained in other similar studies worldwide.

T1  - Cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins in estuarine water and sediment
AN  - 2397280301
AB  - While transfer of freshwater cyanobacteria to estuaries has been observed worldwide, the associated transfer of cyanotoxins is less often reported, in particular the sediment contribution. During fall 2018, we monitored the co-occurrence of cyanobacteria and microcystin (MC) in both the water column and in surface sediments at five stations along a river continuum, from a freshwater reservoir to the coastal area in Brittany, France. Cyanobacteria dominated the phytoplankton community in the water column with high densities at the freshwater sites. Microcystis cells and intracellular MC transfer to estuarine and marine sites were observed with decreasing concentrations in accordance with flow dilution. Extracellular MC showed the opposite trend and increased from upstream to downstream in accordance with the lysing of the cells at elevated salinities. Surface sediment samples contained high densities of colonial Microcystis in freshwater and with decreasing concentrations along the salinity gradient, similar to cells concentrations in the water column. Intracellular MC was detected in sediment at all sites except at the marine outlet suggesting the survival of intact cells. Extracellular MC concentrations in sediment were up to five times higher than intracellular concentrations suggesting incomplete MC degradation. mcyB genes were present at all sites, while mcyA genes were absent at the marine outlet suggesting the presence of toxic strains along the estuary. The high densities of intact colonies of potentially toxic Microcystis in the estuarine sediment strongly suggest that sediments can act as an inoculum of cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins in estuaries.

T1  - Natural Communities of Carotenogenic Chlorophyte <i>Haematococcus lacustris</i> and Bacteria from the White Sea Coastal Rock Ponds
AN  - 2397991238
AB  - Haematococcus lacustris is a biotechnologically important green unicellular alga producing widely used keta-karotenoid astaxanthin. In natural habitats, it exists in the form of algal-bacterial community, and under laboratory conditions, it is also accompanied by bacteria. The issue of the bacterial composition of industrial algal cultures is widely recognized as important. However, there is a dearth of information about bacterial composition of H. lacustris communities. In current work, we analyze the composition of natural H. lacustris communities from the White Sea coastal temporal rock ponds. For the first time, a 16S rRNA gene-based metagenome of natural H. lacustris bacterial communities has been generated. Main results of its analysis are as follow. Bacterial families Comamonadaceae, Cytophagaceae, Xanthomonadaceae, Acetobacteraceae, Rhodobacteraceae, and Rhodocyclaceae were observed in all studied H. lacustris natural communities. They also contained genera Hydrogenophaga and Cytophaga. Bacteria from the Hydrogenophaga genus were present in H. lacustris cultures after their isolation under the conditions of laboratory cultivation. Similar to other planktonic microalgae, H. lacustris forms a phycosphere around the cells. In this zone, bacteria attached to the algal surface. The contact between H. lacustris and bacteria is maintained even after sample drying. The study provides information about possible members of H. lacustris core microbiome, which can be presented in the industrial and laboratory cultures of the microalga.

T1  - Effect of the Hebei Spirit Oil Spill on the Condition, Reproduction, and Energy Storage Cycle of the Manila Clam <i>Ruditapes philippinarum</i> on the West Coast of Korea
AN  - 2178842345
AB  - Seasonal variations in the condition, biochemical composition, and reproduction of Ruditapes philippinarum were investigated from August 2009 to October 2010, 18 months after the Hebei Spirit oil spill off Malipo Beach on the west coast of Korea. No significant differences in physical and nutritional conditions were found between the oil-damaged and the undamaged control beaches. At the undamaged Mongsanpo Beach, all the biometric components (dry tissue weights and biochemical components) remained at low levels during autumn–winter but increased rapidly through spring, followed by a dramatic drop in August. In contrast, at the oil-damaged beach, no clear seasonal fluctuations were detected in the biometric components during the study period. Absolute values of all the components were much higher at the control than at the damaged site. This lack of energy reserves in the clams in the damaged area likely resulted in a failure of gametogenic development. Gonadal maturity index peaked in summer at both beaches. However, the gross egg weight was much higher at the control than at the damaged site during June–July. In addition, its different peak timing between sites indicated a month’s lag in the major spawning pulse at the oil-damaged beach. The spatial variations in all the biometric components of the clams observed in this study clearly implied that the Hebei Spirit oil spill may interfere with the clam phenology at Malipo Beach within 2 to 3 years after the incident.

T1  - Effects of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) on the thyroid status, vitellogenin, and oxidant–antioxidant balance in the Murray River rainbowfish
AN  - 2368393525
AB  - Perfluorooctanoic acid’s (PFOA) widespread use, presence and persistence in the aquatic environment has led to an increasing number of studies focusing on its toxicological effects. In Australia, PFOA has been detected in the aquatic environment, however its effects on Australian native fauna are unknown. In this study, male Australian native fish Murray River rainbowfish (Melanotaenia fluviatilis) were exposed to four different concentrations of PFOA (0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10 mg L−1). Variations in thyroid hormones (Triiodothyronine (T3)/Thyroxine (T4)) and the presence of vitellogenin were determined in plasma. Oxidative stress responses were evaluated in gills and liver. Exposure of male fish to PFOA resulted in altered T3/T4 ratios and the presence of vitellogenin in the plasma. Activities of catalase (CAT) and glutathione- S-transferase (GST) were significantly increased in the gills and significantly reduced in the liver. Lipid peroxidation was observed in both tissues showing that vital organs could not neutralize the peroxides generated by oxidative stress resulting from exposure to PFOA. In natural populations exposed to PFOA, such hormonal disturbances can have negative effects, notably through altered capacity to respond to changes in environmental conditions.

T1  - ASSESSING THE ALLOCHTHONOUS AND AUTOCHTHONOUS SEDIMENT INPUTS IN CONJUNCTION WITH CATCHMENT AND IN SITU DEPOSITIONAL CONDITIONS IN SEVERAL SHALLOW LAKES OF THE DANUBE DELTA AND THE BLACK SEA LITTORAL AREA
AN  - 2652681224
AB  - In order to assess the origin and contribution of the autochthonous and allochthonous material to the recent natural sedimentation, analyses of the main lithological components, i.e., total organic matter (TOM%), total carbonates (CAR%) and minerogenic fraction (SIL%), were performed on several bottom sediment samples, gathered from five lakes. These lakes represent different environmental situations (i.e., deltaic, lagoon and littoral/coastal environment), but they are all influenced by the river/rivulet input of water and sediments. Sampling techniques take into consideration an undisturbed substratum (0 - 30 cm) from surface and subsurface bottom sediment samples, that were collected, using Van Veen Grab Sampler, from 141 stations, along the selected longitudinal and latitudinal transects of the lakes. Loss On Drying and, respectively, Loss On Ignition Methods were used to estimate the percentage contents ofTOM%, CAR% and SIL%. The main physical processes that influence the sediment deposition within these lakes are generally related to hydrodynamics and sediment transport, climatic conditions, and environmental variables within the depositional areas. The results reveal a similar alternating lithology between organic-rich sediments (low energy environmental conditions), mineral-rich sediments (higher energy environmental conditions) and "transitional"/mixed sediments (mixed sediment environments). In complex environments, like the study area, with both fluvial input and high in situ productivity, separating and quantifying the two constituents is not straight forward. Further investigations are required to corroborate the findings of this paper for recent sediment accumulations in environments with mixed sedimentary processes.

T1  - Crime Prediction with Historical Crime and Movement Data of Potential Offenders Using a Spatio-Temporal Cokriging Method
AN  - 2469474533
AB  - Crime prediction using machine learning and data fusion assimilation has become a hot topic. Most of the models rely on historical crime data and related environment variables. The activity of potential offenders affects the crime patterns, but the data with fine resolution have not been applied in the crime prediction. The goal of this study is to test the effect of the activity of potential offenders in the crime prediction by combining this data in the prediction models and assessing the prediction accuracies. This study uses the movement data of past offenders collected in routine police stop-and-question operations to infer the movement of future offenders. The offender movement data compensates historical crime data in a Spatio-Temporal Cokriging (ST-Cokriging) model for crime prediction. The models are implemented for weekly, biweekly, and quad-weekly prediction in the XT police district of ZG city, China. Results with the incorporation of the offender movement data are consistently better than those without it. The improvement is most pronounced for the weekly model, followed by the biweekly model, and the quad-weekly model. In sum, the addition of offender movement data enhances crime prediction, especially for short periods.

T1  - Assessment of Water Quality Using Chemometrics and Multivariate Statistics: A Case Study in Chaobai River Replenished by Reclaimed Water, North China
AN  - 2443348373
AB  - Dry rivers could be effectively recovered by reclaimed water in North China, while river water quality would be an important issue. Therefore, it is important to understand the spatiotemporal variation and controlling factors of river water. Water samples were collected during March, May, July, September, and November in the year 2010, then 20 parameters were analyzed. The water environment was oxidizing and alkaline, which was beneficial for nitrification. Nitrate was the main nitrogen form. Depleted and enriched isotopes were found in reclaimed water and river water, respectively. Total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) of reclaimed water exceed the threshold of reclaimed water reuse standard and Class V in the surface water quality criteria. Most river water was at the severe eutrophication level. The sodium adsorption ratio indicated a medium harmful level for irrigation purpose. Significant spatial and temporal variation was explored by cluster analysis. Five months and nine stations were both classified into two distinct clusters. It was found that 6 parameters (chloride: Cl−, sulphate: SO42−, potassium: K+, sodium: Na+, magnesium: Mg2+, and total dissolved solids: TDS) had significant upward temporal variation, and 12 parameters (dissolved oxygen: DO, electric conductivity: EC, bicarbonate: HCO3−, K+, Na+, Ca2+, TDS, nitrite-nitrogen: NO2-N, nitrate nitrogen: NO3-N, TN, TP, and chlorophyll a: Chl.a) and 4 parameters (Mg2+, ammonia nitrogen: NH3-N, and the oxygen-18 and hydron-2 stable isotope: δ18O and δ2H) had a significant downward and upward spatial trend, respectively. The Gibbs plot showed that river water chemistry was mainly controlled by a water–rock interaction. The ionic relationship and principal component analysis showed that river water had undergone the dissolution of carbonate, calcite, and silicate minerals, cation exchange, a process of nitrification, photosynthesis of phytoplankton, and stable isotope enrichment. In addition, gypsum and salt rock have a potential dissolution process.

T1  - Thallium accumulation in different organisms from karst and lowland rivers of Croatia under wastewater impact
AN  - 2430953689
AB  - The aim of the present research was to investigate the bioaccumulation of thallium (Tl), a technology-critical element, in fish intestine and muscle, gammarids and the fish intestinal parasites, acanthocephalans, and to evaluate their potential as indicators of metal exposure in aquatic environments. Moreover, total and cytosolic (metabolically available and potentially toxic fraction) Tl concentrations were measured and compared between the intestines of brown trout (Salmo trutta Linnaeus, 1758) from the karst Krka River and Prussian carp (Carassius gibelio Bloch, 1782) from the lowland Ilova River. Since there is a scarcity of information on subcellular metal partitioning in the fish intestine, the results of Tl concentrations in acid digested intestinal tissue, homogenate and cytosol represent preliminary data on Tl diet-borne uptake in salmonid and cyprinid fish. In both rivers, samplings were performed upstream (reference site) and downstream (contaminated site) of the wastewater impact in autumn and spring. Total Tl concentrations were much higher in brown trout than Prussian carp, and higher proportions of cytosolic Tl concentrations were observed in the intestinal tissue of brown trout (45–71 %) compared with that of Prussian carp (32–47 %). Therefore, both indicators showed species- and site-specific differences. Considering different bioindicator organisms, the most effective Tl accumulation was evident in acanthocephalans compared with the fish tissues and gammarids, which confirmed the potential of fish parasites as bioindicators of metal exposure. Trends of spatial and temporal Tl variability were mostly comparable in all indicator organisms and for total and cytosolic Tl concentrations in the intestine of salmonid and cyprinid fish species, which confirmed their application as useful biological tools in metal exposure assessment.

T1  - Protein Recovery from Underutilised Marine Bioresources for Product Development with Nutraceutical and Pharmaceutical Bioactivities
AN  - 2429342465
AB  - The global demand for dietary proteins and protein-derived products are projected to dramatically increase which cannot be met using traditional protein sources. Seafood processing by-products (SPBs) and microalgae are promising resources that can fill the demand gap for proteins and protein derivatives. Globally, 32 million tonnes of SPBs are estimated to be produced annually which represents an inexpensive resource for protein recovery while technical advantages in microalgal biomass production would yield secure protein supplies with minimal competition for arable land and freshwater resources. Moreover, these biomaterials are a rich source of proteins with high nutritional quality while protein hydrolysates and biopeptides derived from these marine proteins possess several useful bioactivities for commercial applications in multiple industries. Efficient utilisation of these marine biomaterials for protein recovery would not only supplement global demand and save natural bioresources but would also successfully address the financial and environmental burdens of biowaste, paving the way for greener production and a circular economy. This comprehensive review analyses the potential of using SPBs and microalgae for protein recovery and production critically assessing the feasibility of current and emerging technologies used for the process development. Nutritional quality, functionalities, and bioactivities of the extracted proteins and derived products together with their potential applications for commercial product development are also systematically summarised and discussed.

T1  - Cadmium Pollution in the Tourism Environment: A Literature Review
AN  - 2417818902
AB  - Cadmium is a highly-toxic metal, and, its environmental occurrence and human exposure consequently deserve close attention. The insight into the relationships between cadmium and tourism relations has deepened during the past three decades and the research into this relationship is reviewed. For this purpose, 83 relevant publications (mainly articles in international journals) were analyzed. It was found that investigation of Cd in the tourism environment took place in all continents (except Antarctica) and has intensified since the mid-2000s; Chinese researchers are the most active contributors. The Cd occurrence in air, living organisms, sediments, soil, suspended particular matter, water, and of the human environment has been studied. It has become clear that tourism contributes to Cd pollution (particularly, by hotel wastewater and increased traffic), and, vice versa, Cd pollution of beaches, coastal waters, food, urban parks, etc. creates risks for tourists and increases human exposure to this toxic metal. Both mechanisms have received equal attention. Examples concern many places worldwide, with the Mediterranean and Central and Eastern Europe as apparently critical regions. Our significantly incomplete knowledge of the relationships between cadmium and tourism must be ascribed to the common oversimplification of these relationships and to the scarcity or even absence of information supplied by the most important tourist destinations. The present review demonstrates that more studies of heavy metals and, particularly, Cd in the tourism environment are needed.

T1  - Effect of feed additives from marine hydrobionts on the protein metabolism condition in broiler chickens
AN  - 2416530911
AB  - There was studied the effect of two feed additives made from finely ground wastes of the primary processing of marine aquatic organisms on the biochemical parameters of the protein metabolism of the blood serum of broiler chickens of Ross 308 cross. The composition of the mineral feed additive (MFA) included mussel leaves and seawater, the protein-mineral feed additive (PMFA) - the leaves of large and the body of small mussels, seaweed Phyllophora nervosa and seawater. The determination of blood serum indices was performed using an automatic biochemical analyzer GBG ChemWell2910 (USA) and the use of test systems Global Scientific (USA). According to the results of biochemical studies of the broiler chickens' blood serum, the diet of which was supplemented with feed additives, there was established an increase in the total protein content, incl. albumin and globulin. Compared with MFA, the use of PMFA to a greater extent increased the content of total protein, albumin, and globulin. The total protein content changes and its fractions occurred due to an increase in the activity of transamination enzymes: alanine and aspartate aminotransferase and the absence of changes in glucose content. Due to the relatively smaller increase in the amount of albumin compared to globulin, the albumin-globulin ratio in the chickens of the experimental groups was lower. Among the globulin fractions, the greatest changes were observed in the relative content of á2 -globulins. Based on the results of the research, a conclusion was drawn on the stimulating effect of feed additives of marine aquatic organisms on the protein metabolism condition of broiler chickens.

T1  - Understanding the Ecological Response of Planktic and Benthic Epipelic Algae to Environmental Factors in an Urban Rivers System
AN  - 2400572291
AB  - Many studies have been concentrated on the distribution of algae in lakes, rivers, and seas, however, few studies have been concerned about their distribution and relation with polluted urban rivers. In this study, the spatio-temporal variation characteristics of water quality and algae community in Nanjing city were investigated with microscopic examination for one year. Results showed that the water pollution in this area was mainly related to high concentration of nitrogen (NH3-N and TN (Total nitrogen). There was a total of 77 species of algae in the studied rivers from June 2016 to May 2017, among which 73 species of planktic algae and 34 species of epipelic algae, in which the abundance and biomass of the latter were 1925 and 904 times that of the former, respectively. The two kinds of algae had different change tendencies which were related to seasons. For planktic algae, the abundance and biomass decreased in this season sequence: summer, spring, autumn, and winter. For epipelic algae, the abundance and biomass were relatively higher in winter. The dominant community of planktic algae was Chlorophyta-Bacillariophyceae-Cyanobacteria type, while that of epipelic algae was Bacillariophyceae—Cyanobacteria type. Most of the present algae were bi-trophic species, and were tightly related to the pollution characteristics of the rivers. The key environmental factors for planktic algae are T, TN, and TP, and those for Epipelic algae are N:P and TN. The relation between the community composition of planktic and epipelic algae and environmental parameters are highly complex, and it is worth carrying out further study to clarify their interaction mechanism.

T1  - Transfer of the Neurotoxin β-N-methylamino-l-alanine (BMAA) in the Agro–Aqua Cycle
AN  - 2400239271
AB  - The neurotoxic non-protein amino acid β-N-methylamino-l-alanine (BMAA) is connected to the development of neurodegenerative diseases. BMAA has been shown to accumulate in aquatic ecosystems, and filter-feeding molluscs seem particularly susceptible to BMAA accumulation. The blue mussels farmed along the Swedish coastline in the Baltic Sea are, due to their small size, exclusively used to produce feed for chicken and fish in the agro–aqua cycle. We have investigated the possible biotransfer of BMAA from mussels, via mussel-based feed, into chickens. Chickens were divided into two groups, the control and the treatment. BMAA was extracted from the muscle, liver, brain, and eye tissues in both chicken groups; a UPLC-MS/MS method was subsequently used to quantify BMAA. The results indicate detectable concentrations of BMAA in both chicken groups. However, the BMAA concentration in chicken was 5.65 times higher in the treatment group than the control group, with the highest concentration found in muscle tissue extracted from the treatment group chickens. These data suggest that there is a BMAA transfer route within the agro-aqua cycle, so further investigation is recommended before using mussel-based feed in the chicken industry.

T1  - Strain-specific responses of toxic and non-toxic <i>Microcystis aeruginosa</i> to exudates of heterotrophic bacteria
AN  - 2298926364
AB  - Although the cyanobacterium Microcystis is colonial during water blooms, isolated Microcystis strains become unicellular in culture. Studies indicate that heterotrophic bacteria can promote Microcystis colonies in culture, but little is known about the underlying mechanism or how widespread it is among bacteria. This study investigated the identity and colony-promoting effects of bacteria isolated from the 2014 Microcystis bloom in Lake Erie. Isolates were classified by their 16S rRNA gene sequences. Toxic and non-toxic cultures of M. aeruginosa were exposed to exudates of bacterial isolates, and their morphology, polysaccharide content, and reflectance spectra were compared to those of M. aeruginosa control cultures. Six isolates belonging to three genera enhanced the frequency or size of M. aeruginosa colonies in cultures where a dialysis barrier prevented direct contact between heterotrophic cells and M. aeruginosa cells. Toxic and non-toxic M. aeruginosa strains differed in how their morphology and optical properties responded to treatment. This study demonstrates that heterotrophic bacteria can promote colonial morphology in Microcystis without making physical contact with the Microcystis cells, as well as the first to indicate that toxic and non-toxic strains of the same morphospecies have different morphological and optical responses.

T1  - Research on ecotoxicology of microplastics on freshwater aquatic organisms
AN  - 2328366209
AB  - As a new type of pollutant, microplastics are an emerging scientific and social concern in the environment and are widely distributed in the aquatic environment and organism. Nowadays, researches on microplastic pollution mainly focus on the marine environment. As a bridge for the migration of microplastics from the terrestrial environment to the marine environment, the freshwater environment has been deserved more attention. Published articles on microplastics in freshwater environments were reviewed in this paper, and four typical behaviors of microplastics were summarized: biological ingestion, biological attachment, adsorption of pollutants and release of plasticizers. In addition, the progress in research and results on the ecological toxicity of microplastics to freshwater organisms was also analyzed. Finally, emphasis on future research on the toxicity of microplastics to freshwater aquatics organisms was made throughout this review as a tool in microplastic risk assessment research.

T1  - Toxicity, residue, degradation and detection methods of the insecticide triazophos
AN  - 2264801763
AB  - Organophosphorus pesticides were widely used in agricultural production and in public health as insecticides and acaricides. Triazophos, an organophosphorus insecticide widely used in developing countries, has been found in agricultural products and the environment. Additionally, triazophos is toxic for aquatic organisms and poses a  risk of dietary exposure. This article reviews the toxicity, the residues in agricultural products, water and soil, exposure risk, metabolism, microbial degradation, hydrolysis, and photolytic and detection methods of triazophos. Commonly used methods for triazophos detection include chromatography-mass spectrometry and rapid methods based on antigen–antibody reactions. China had made many advances in studying triazophos-degrading bacteria and rapid detection methods of triazophos residues. We also found that triazophos causes oxidative stress, cell damage and tissue injury in animals through neurotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, reproductive toxicity and genotoxicity.

T1  - Evaluation of genotoxicity and hematological effects in common carp (<i>Cyprinus carpio)</i> induced by disinfection by-products
AN  - 2311446927
AB  - Disinfection is intended to improve drinking water quality and human health. Although disinfectants may transform organic matter and form disinfection by-products (DBPs), many are branded as cyto- and genotoxic. Traditionally, research focuses on the effects of DBPs on human health, but cytogenic impacts on aquatic organisms still remain ill defined. The current study examines the potential toxic effect of chloroform and iodoform (DBPs) on Cyprinus carpio, selected as a model organism. Fish specimens were exposed to various concentrations of DBPs primarily based on LD50 values, where acute toxicity was monitored for 96 h. Headspace SPME extraction through gas chromatography was employed to assess the effects of spiked DBPs doses in fish blood. Cytotoxicity was monitored using Comet assay. Tail length, tail DNA, and olive tail moment values were quantified to be significant (P

T1  - DNA damage and physiological responses in an Indian major carp <i>Labeo rohita</i> exposed to an antimicrobial agent triclosan
AN  - 2243884128
AB  - This study is aimed to evaluate the toxic effects of triclosan (TCS) in an Indian major carp Labeo rohita. The 96-h LC50 value of triclosan to L. rohita was found to be 0.39 mg L−1. Fish were exposed to two sublethal concentrations (0.039 mg L−1, treatment I and 0.078 mg L−1, treatment II) of TCS for 35 days, and certain hematobiochemical, antioxidant, histopathological responses were measured. Compared to the control group, there was a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in the values and genotoxicity of hematological parameters such as hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), and erythrocyte (RBC) in TCS-exposed fish, but the values of leucocyte count (WBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) were found to be increased. A biphasic response in mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) value was observed during the study period (35 days). Significant (p < 0.05) alterations in plasma biochemical parameters (glucose and protein), electrolytes (Na+, K+, and Cl−), and transaminases (GOT and GPT) were observed in fish treated with TCS in both treatments. Gill Na+/K+-ATPase activity was found to be decreased in fish treated with TCS in both treatments. Enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant index levels have also fluctuated in all the tissues (gill, liver, and kidney). The histological lesions were comparatively more severe in the gill than the liver and kidney. Comet assay showed DNA damage on exposure at two sublethal concentrations. The present results suggest that TCS is highly toxic to fish even at sublethal concentrations.

T1  - Behavioral and biochemical effects of the antifouler and antidandruff zinc pyrithione on the freshwater fish <i>Gambusia holbrooki</i>
AN  - 2211208243
AB  - The presence of pharmaceutical residues in the aquatic environment is receiving great attention since the levels of these substances have significantly increased in this compartment, potentially leading to adverse ecological effects. Zinc pyrithione (ZnPt) is a widely used organometallic biocide, which is incorporated into antifouling formulas, such as paints, to prevent the establishment of biofilms on surfaces exposed to the aquatic environment. It is also used in cosmetics, such as antidandruff shampoos and soaps. Considering this wide use, and the absence of a significant amount of data on the toxicity of ZnPt especially towards non-target organisms, the objective of this study was to characterize the toxicity of ZnPt, on several ecological relevant endpoints assessed in the fish Gambusia holbrooki. For this purpose, we measured traits related to feeding and aggressive behavior, as well as indicators of oxidative stress (CAT and GSTs), neurotoxicity (AChE), and anaerobic metabolism (LDH), after acute and chronic exposures to ZnPt. In terms of behavioral features, the feeding test showed the occurrence of significant differences between the control animals and those exposed to a concentration of ZnPt of 45 μg/L. In addition, ZnPt caused changes in terms of oxidative stress biomarkers (CAT and GSTs), for both exposure periods. ZnPt was also capable of causing changes in the cholinergic neurotransmission functioning and anaerobic metabolism, but only following the chronic exposure.

T1  - Potential effects of electrical energy transmission – the case study from the Polish Marine Areas (southern Baltic Sea)
AN  - 2240327294
AB  - The operation of offshore wind turbines and electricity transmission through submarine cables over long distances generate electromagnetic or static magnetic fields (depending on the technical solution) that may modify the natural geomagnetic field and cause induced electric and electromagnetic fields in the water. The present study synthesizes the current knowledge and speculates on the possible environmental impact of electrical energy transfer based on the example of the Polish Marine Areas (southern Baltic Sea). We review the possible effects of the electrical energy induction and transfer against the existing and planned wind turbine installations. Furthermore, we consider different cable design variants as a way of environmental impact mitigation. Possible impacts of induced magnetic fields on marine organisms and, consequently, on the ecosystem functioning are also addressed.

T1  - Identification assisted by molecular markers of larval parasites in two limpet species (Patellogastropoda: <i>Nacella</i>) inhabiting Antarctic and Magellan coastal systems
AN  - 2229807350
AB  - In the Southern Ocean, many parasites of vertebrates (mainly helminth groups) have been recognized as endemic species, but parasites of marine invertebrates remain almost unknown. It is reasonable to assume that digenean larvae will parasitize gastropods, bivalves, amphipods, and annelids, the usual first and second intermediate hosts for those parasites. Here, using an identification assisted by molecular markers, we report the Digenea species parasitizing the most abundant limpet species inhabiting ice-free rocky intertidal and subtidal zones of the Southern Ocean, viz. Nacella concinna from the Antarctic and Nacella deaurata from the Magellan region. The limpets harbored larval Digenea (two metacercariae and one sporocyst). Phylogenetic analysis based on the multilocus tree supported the hypothesis that N. concinna is parasitized by a species of Gymnophallidae, whereas the limpet N. deaurata is parasitized by Gymnophalloides nacellae and a species of Renicolidae. In addition, differences in prevalence and intensity were also recorded between the two compared host species and also from other congeneric species. This new knowledge in parasite species in marine invertebrates from the Southern Ocean reveals the presence of a particular parasite fauna and confirms the utility of molecular tools to identify biodiversity still scarcely known.

T1  - Levels of heavy metals in the straightfin barb <i>Enteromius paludinosus</i> (Peters 1852) from River Malewa, Naivasha, Kenya
AN  - 2212607830
AB  - There have been several studies on heavy metals in Lake Naivasha. However, none of them has reported the levels of mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), and chromium (Cr). Moreover, there are no studies on the heavy metals’ concentrations in the straightfin barb (Enteromius paludinosus, Peters 1852), a fish species that hosts a parasite (Ligula intestinalis), the latter having been reported to have a high ability to absorb heavy metals from its host. This paper therefore addresses the accumulation of heavy metals, namely arsenic (As), chromium (Cr), lead (Pb), and mercury (Hg) in the tissues of straightfin barb, Enteromius paludinosus (Peters 1852) from the mouth of River Malewa in Lake Naivasha, Kenya. A total of 1307 fish were collected during the month of November 2017. Water samples, sediment samples, 25 fish muscle tissues, and its endoparasite, the cestode Ligula intestinalis, were isolated, and heavy metal concentrations were determined using the thermal-electron atomic absorption spectrophotometer at the Lake Nakuru Water Quality Testing Laboratory. The concentrations of heavy metals in the sediment were below the lowest effect level in sediment, threshold effect concentration in sediment, severe effect concentration in sediment, and the shale values of sedimentary rocks thus showing no sign of pollution. In the muscle tissues of the fish, As, Cr, Pb, and Hg showed high levels with mean concentrations of 5.0696, 22.0854, 45.2108, and 1.5458 mg/kg ww, respectively. Bioconcentration factors further supported the observation that trace element accumulation was higher in fish compared with sediment and water. The target hazard quotients of As, Cr, Pb, and Hg obtained for both the female and male were > 1 indicating a possible health risk associated with the consumption of E. paludinosus. The bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) for L. intestinalis were 2.4093, 2.1873, 5.8601, and 5.1395 for As, Cr, Pb, and Hg, respectively, indicating the potential of the cestode in the accumulation of heavy metals from the host; hence, it can be used as an accumulation bioindicator.

T1  - Composition and settling properties of suspended particulate matter in estuaries of the Chesapeake Bay and Baltic Sea regions
AN  - 2164003624
AB  - PurposeOur goal was to understand how differences in source material (allochthonous vs. autochthonous) and phytoplankton communities (diatoms vs. cyanobacteria) influence composition and settling properties of suspended particulate matter.Materials and methodsWe characterized the composition and settling properties of suspended particulate matter in two systems—one which has a high hydrologic loading factor (watershed to surface area ratio), and a diatom-dominated phytoplankton community (James River Estuary, USA), and a second, where hydrologic inputs are proportionally smaller, and the summer phytoplankton community is  dominated by cyanobacteria (Curonian Lagoon, Lithuania).Results and discussionIn the James, we found that TSS concentrations were positively related to discharge, whereas POC concentrations were negatively correlated with discharge and positively correlated with Chl-a. We infer that suspended particulate matter in this system was largely derived from allochthonous inputs, but that the organic matter fraction was derived from autochthonous production. In the Curonian Lagoon, TSS concentrations were correlated with Chl-a, but not discharge, indicating that suspended particulate matter was largely of autochthonous origin. In the James, the proportion of settleable materials was greater during high TSS concentrations, indicating that high discharge events delivered heavier particulates. In the Curonian Lagoon, we observed a seasonal decline in settling rates associated with the shift from mixed (diatoms and chlorophytes) to cyanobacteria-dominated phytoplankton, which we attribute to the presence of positively buoyant cyanobacteria.ConclusionsWe found that a comparative approach yielded useful insights regarding sources, composition, and settling properties of suspended particulate matter in two estuaries that differ in hydrologic loading and phytoplankton community composition. Our findings suggest that the presence of positively buoyant cyanobacteria favors export losses of particulate C, N, and P to marine waters over retention through sedimentation in transitional zones.

T1  - Miocene syn-rift lacustrine sediments in the Mecsek Mts. (SW Hungary)
AN  - 2682969207
AB  - The Pannonian Basin, a major back-arc basin in the Alpine–Carpathian orogenic belt, experienced its syn-rift phase during the Early–Middle Miocene. Studying coeval sediments can provide important information on the initiation of the extension. This paper investigates syn-rift deposits in the Mecsek Mts. in SW Hungary from a tectono-sedimentary aspect, using stratigraphy, palaeontology and structural observations to constrain palaeoenvironments and their tectonic background. Our study shows that in the Mecsek area the widespread Early Miocene fluvial sedimentation was not directly followed by inundation by the Central Paratethys sea, instead, a phase of lacustrine deposition in the Karpatian–Early Badenian (late Burdigalian–early Langhian) preceded the marine flooding. The lake sediments have a low-diversity but abundant, endemic mollusc and ostracod fauna, dominated by the bivalve Congeria boeckhi and the gastropod Ferebithynia vadászi. Identical faunas at various sites indicate that “Lake Mecsek” was a single water body, covering the present-day Mecsek Mts. and their surroundings. Wedge-shaped clastic bodies along faults, fault scarp breccias and semi-soft sediment deformations suggest that extensional tectonic activity related to the rifting of the Pannonian Basin played a role in lake basin formation. The accumulation of lakes was probably also enhanced by increased precipitation during the Miocene Climatic Optimum. The Central Paratethys flooded the area in the Badenian (Langhian) and deposited normal marine sediments over the lacustrine ones. Considering the fauna, the sedimentary succession, the structural background and evolution history, the Mecsek area seems to be part of the Illyrian bioprovince and related to the Dinaride Lake System.

T1  - Oyster (Crassostrea gasar) gastrointestinal tract microbiota and immunological responses after antibiotic administration
AN  - 2204522017
AB  - Microbiota, the microorganisms that colonize living organisms. Oysters rely exclusively on an innate immune system. This study characterized the cultivable gastrointestinal tract microbiota (GTM) of the oyster Crassostrea gasar and evaluated their influence on immune responses. Antibiotics were used to reduce or alter the microbiota during in vitro and in vivo assays. Haemocyte viability, concentration, and phagocytic capacity, as well as the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), were evaluated in antibiotic-treated and control oysters. Microbiological analysis of the gastrointestinal tract was also performed; bacteria were selected using culture media and were identified by 16S ribosomal DNA. The results showed that the antibiotics eliminated bacteria in vitro but increased their concentrations in vivo. The GTM was composed of 26% amylolytic bacteria, 21% lipolytic bacteria, 18% proteolytic bacteria, 18% cellulolytic bacteria and 17% lactic acid bacteria; there were no differences in the amounts of these bacterial types between the control and treated oysters. Three major bacterial phyla, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, and seven genera, Labrenzia, Pseudomonas, Halomonas, Shewanella, Vibrio, Bacillus, and Micrococcus, were detected. The concentration, viability, and phagocytic capacity of hemocytes and the production of ROS were not significantly altered by antibiotic treatment. In conclusion, the antibiotics altered the number of heterotrophic bacteria without changing hemocyte function, suggesting that this assay could be useful for verifying the influence of microbiota in host-parasite interactions.

T1  - Contribution of trace metallic elements to weakly contaminated lacustrine sediments: effects on benthic and pelagic organisms through multi-species laboratory bioassays
AN  - 2177016492
AB  - Surficial sediments exhibit higher levels of contamination than overlying water, especially from persistent contaminants such as trace metallic elements (TMEs). While sediments could in turn act as sources of contamination for the water column, their ecotoxicology is yet rarely assessed in a multi-compartments perspective. This study aims at assessing the response of benthic and pelagic organisms exposed to weakly contaminated sediments using a multi-species laboratory assay by focusing on TMEs (Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn) contamination. Chironomus riparius larvae, Daphnia magna, and Lemna minor were simultaneously exposed for 10 days to six sediments sampled from the littoral of a large French lake (Lake Bourget). The endpoints consisted in the survival and growth rates and the bioconcentration factor (BCF). Significant negative relationships between sediment TME concentrations and survival rates of C. riparius and growth rates of C. riparius and D. magna suggested that both benthic and pelagic macro-invertebrates were impacted by sediment contamination, which was not observed in L. minor. Significant relationships of the sediment with the internal TME concentrations were positive while negative with the BCFs, suggesting an increase in biological regulation processes in all organisms with the increase of sediment TME concentrations. These results underline the importance of including both benthic and pelagic organisms in ecotoxicological assessment of low contaminated sediments and the relevance of the relationship BCFs/sediment contamination as prior biomarkers than higher life history traits.

T1  - Mating under the influence: male Siamese fighting fish prefer EE2-exposed females
AN  - 2167526429
AB  - Countless pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) exist on the market with more added each day. Many of these compounds are not removed during the wastewater treatment process and enter bodies of water in their active form. EDCs are known to have physiological and behavioral effects in exposed organisms. Exposure to the synthetic estrogen 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2), a common EDC found in birth control pills, has been found to lead to population collapse after only a few generations in some fish species. Mechanisms identified as potential driving forces for collapse include feminization of males and altered fecundity in both sexes. However, an additional way in which EE2 could lead to population collapse is by altering courtship behavior, which could then change mating preferences and decrease mating opportunities. The current study had the following objectives: determine if exposing female Siamese fighting fish, Betta splendens, to EE2 changes mate choice in males; assess if the dose and duration of female exposure matters; and examine if exposing males to EE2 influences their mating preferences. Both unexposed and exposed males were presented with pairs of females that differed in EE2 dose and exposure duration. The results indicate that males were more responsive to EE2-exposed females than unexposed females, with males being most responsive to females exposed to the low versus high dose. Furthermore, exposed males responded less overall than unexposed males. If EE2 concentration increases in the environment, the likelihood of successful mating could decrease and, therefore, potentially lead to adverse population impacts.

T1  - The effect of the physicochemical conditions variations on the behavior of heavy metals trapped in polluted fluvial system sediments: the case of Oued Sebou, Morocco
AN  - 2167567466
AB  - This study was an attempt to understand the factors influencing the heavy metal distribution in polluted fluvial system sediments. Various biogeochemical processes and anthropogenic factors were playing an important role in altering the concentration of heavy metals in the sediments. This paper has two objectives: The first one is to investigate the effect of the variation in the physicochemical conditions on the speciation of trace elements trapped in the sediments of the Sebou River. The second one is to study the kinetics mobilization of these heavy metals. Batch resuspension experiments were conducted in order to investigate the release of heavy metals from a polluted anoxic sediment submitted to different physicochemical conditions variations. It has been revealed that in oxygenated environment, sediments were oxidized which cause the release of some heavy metals, but their concentrations, as dissolved phase, were sustained constant or were increased with time. However, in acidic and anaerobic environment, most of the metallic trace elements were released together with the iron and the manganese, but some of these elements like chromium were precipitated. However, some of other elements were maintained in solution, which represents a real human health risk.

T1  - Age- and sex-dependent variation in the activity of antioxidant enzymes in the brown trout (<i>Salmo trutta</i>)
AN  - 2088803681
AB  - Oxidative stress is defined as the imbalance between pro-oxidant and antioxidant molecules in favor of the former and it represents one of the main driving forces of aging. To counteract the harmful effects of oxidative stress, organisms evolved a complex antioxidant system. According to the free radical theory of aging, while the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) increases with age, the antioxidant defenses decline. Although this relationship has been investigated in diverse vertebrate taxa, the information in fish is scant and inconsistent, particularly for wild populations. Thus, the aim of the present study was the investigation of age- and sex-related changes of the antioxidant enzymes activity in free-living individuals of the brown trout (Salmo trutta). We measured the activity of the main enzymes involved in antioxidant protection, namely superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione S-transferase (GST), as well as lipid peroxidation, in the gills and the liver dissected from brown trout (1+- to 5+-year-old). A significant age-dependent variation in the activity of antioxidant enzymes was noted, with the exception of CAT. GPx activity followed a significant increasing trend with age in both the organs, while SOD decreased in the liver. Increased GST activity was found in the gills only. Lipid peroxidation levels significantly decreased with age in both the organs. SOD and CAT showed sex-dependent differences in the liver of brown trout, with males showing lower enzymatic activity than females. Our data contribute to improve the knowledge on the relationship between antioxidant enzyme activity, aging, and sex in fish.

T1  - Management Transition to the Great Lakes Nearshore: Insights from Hydrodynamic Modeling
AN  - 2548597112
AB  - The emerging shift in Great Lakes management from offshore to nearshore waters will require attention to complexities of coastal hydrodynamics and biogeochemical transformations. Emphasizing hydrodynamics, this work resolves transport processes in quantifying discharge plume and pollutant of concern (POC) footprint dimensions, the latter being the portion of the plume where water quality standards are not met. A generic approach, isolated from pollutant-specific biokinetics, provides first-approximation estimates of the footprint area. A high-resolution, linked hydrodynamic-tracer model is applied at a site in the Greater Toronto Area on Lake Ontario. Model results agree with observed meteorological and hydrodynamic conditions and satisfactorily simulate plume dimensions. Footprints are examined in the context of guidelines for regulatory mixing zone size and attendant loss of beneficial use. We demonstrate that the ratio of the water quality standard to the POC concentration at discharge is a key determinant of footprint dimensions. Footprint size for traditional pollutants (ammonia, total phosphorus) meets regulatory guidelines; however, that for soluble reactive phosphorus, a presently unattended pollutant, is ~1–2 orders of magnitude larger. This suggests that it may be necessary to upgrade treatment technologies to maintain consistency with regulatory guidelines and mitigate manifestations of the eutrophication-related soluble reactive phosphorus POC.

T1  - Water column nutrient processing rates in rivermouths of Green Bay (Lake Michigan)
AN  - 2131538805
AB  - Understanding the quantity and form of nutrient loads to large lakes is necessary to understand controls over primary production, phytoplankton community composition and the production of phytotoxins. Nutrient loading estimates to large lakes are primarily made at stream gages that are deliberately placed outside the direct influence of lake processes, but these estimates cannot take into account processes that occur in the biologically active river-to-lake transition zone. These transition zones (rivermouths) sometimes alter nutrient concentrations and ratios substantially, but few studies have directly measured processing rates of nutrients within rivermouths. From April through September 2016, we conducted 23 water column incubation experiments to measure nutrient loss rates in four rivermouths. First order loss rates (K) for inorganic nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) indicated greater loss in light than in dark treatments, suggesting primary production increases N and P removal. Variability in K was high across both time and space, and the measured environmental parameters did not appear to be strongly associated with this variation in K for most N and P forms. If the measured K values and water residence times are accurate, then between 0 and 99% of the inorganic P and nitrates entering the rivermouth would be lost (i.e., converted to organic or particulate P). In late summer, Fox River discharge is low and residence times are usually long, which allow for much higher proportional nutrient removal in the water column. Water column processing appears to be capable of transforming large quantities of dissolved N and P to particulate forms and thus altering its transport and presumably its bioavailability.

T1  - GST transcriptional changes induced by a toxic <i>Microcystis aeruginosa</i> strain in two bivalve species during exposure and recovery phases
AN  - 2110393751
AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated the modulation of glutathione transferases (GSTs) induced by microcystin (MC) alone or in combination with other cyanobacterial secondary metabolites in bivalves. However, interspecies information about which and how GST isoforms are affected by these secondary metabolites is still scarce, especially considering the dynamic process involving their uptake and elimination routes. In this context, the role of GSTs gene expression changes in response to a toxic Microcystis aeruginosa extract were examined for Mytilus galloprovincialis and Ruditapes philippinarum during exposure and recovery phases. The expression levels of sigma 1, sigma 2, pi and mu-class GST genes were analyzed in the hepatopancreas of both bivalve species during cyanobacteria extract exposure (24 h) and post-exposure (24 and 72 h). Only a significant induction of sigma 1-class GST expression was observed for R. philippinarum upon 24-hour exposure of both bivalve species to Microcystis extract. During the recovery phase, GST transcriptional changes for M. galloprovincialis were characterized by an early induction (24 h) of sigma 1 and sigma 2 transcripts. On the other hand, GST transcriptional changes for R. philippinarum during post-exposure phase were characterized by an early induction (24 h) of sigma 1 and mu transcripts and a later induction (72 h) of the four analyzed GST transcripts. Such differences reflect variable GST response mechanisms to cope with MC-producing cyanobacterial blooms exposure between these two bivalve species, revealing a higher sensitivity of R. philippinarum to Microcystis-induced stress than M. galloprovincialis. The results also suggest a much higher level of activity of the GST detoxification system during the recovery phase compared to the period of the stress exposure for both bivalve species.

T1  - Rising profile on the use of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) for the removal of heavy metals from the environment: an overview
AN  - 2110278861
AB  - This review study is dealing with the recent advances and developments in the metal–organic framework (MOF) materials especially in the aspect of environmental remediation of heavy metals. Its application in some area of technological and mechanical advancement was also considered. The process of its synthesis and characterization was also put into consideration. Metal-organic frameworks can be said to be an exciting new class of nanoporous crystalline materials containing a metal as its central ion surrounded by organic ligands. An overwhelming characteristic of MOFs lies in its surface area which is amazingly large, exceeding those of known best activated carbons and zeolites. There is an increasingly high demand in the application of MOFs for a multitude of environmental uses or application to be used for capturing and separating various unwanted or even environmentally harmful chemicals, elements or materials. The advantage of MOFs over other known adsorbent materials, such as zeolites and carbon black, is that it possesses a far greater surface area along with amazingly great pore properties. In this review the synthesis and characterization of MOFs, the fate of heavy metals, the application of MOFs in heavy metals remediation and other means of heavy metals remediation are well discussed.

T1  - Characterization of Temporal and Spatial Variability of Phosphorus Loading to Lake Erie from the Western Basin Using Wavelet Transform Methods
AN  - 2120770339
AB  - The characterization of temporal and spatial patterns in phosphorus (P) loading in Lake Erie is essential in order to continue monitoring the excessive P condition that comes from the western Lake Erie Basin. This study aims to perform such a characterization using the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) methods. These wavelet transformations were conducted on streamflow data, TP loads, and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) of six stations located near Lake Erie of Northern Ohio. These stations are located near the outlet of Cuyahoga, Grand, Maumee, Vermilion, Raisin, and Sandusky watersheds. Long-term continuous P loading data, in which some dated back to 1970, were used in the analysis. The results obtained from the CWT and DWT approaches were found to complement each other. Streamflow had significant mixed variability at 1, 2, and 4 years. The variability for SRP was limited to 1 and 2 years while the TP variability was only seen at the 1-year scale. It was interesting to find that strong temporal patterns of SRP were observed in most of the watersheds only after the mid-1990s. The CWT wavelet spectra also reflected the land use characteristics of each watershed. For example, the wavelet spectra of surface runoff and TP for the agricultural watersheds (i.e., Raisin, Sandusky, and Maumee Rivers) were similar and characterized by significant variability primarily at the annual scale and at the two to four-year periodicities. The urbanized watershed (i.e., Cuyahoga River) did not show any association between either phosphorus (TP or SRP) with surface runoff and baseflow, which indicates that P in the urbanized watershed was not driven by the flow.

T1  - Effects of temperature changes on the generation of reactive oxygen species and the expression and activity of glutathione-<i>S</i> transferases in two congeneric copepods <i>Tigriopus japonicus</i> and <i>Tigriopus kingsejongensis</i>
AN  - 2063531776
AB  - We measured the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the enzymatic activity and expression of glutathione-S transferase (GST) in response to temperature changes in the temperate copepod Tigriopus japonicus and the Antarctic copepod Tigriopus kingsejongensis. The levels of ROS and GST enzymatic activity were slightly elevated (P < 0.05) in T. japonicus in response to temperature changes but not in T. kingsejongensis. Furthermore, transcriptional regulation of all the GST genes in T. japonicus was significantly downregulated (P < 0.05) in response to temperature elevation to 35 °C, whereas messenger RNA expression of GST genes in T. kingsejongensis showed a significant increase (P < 0.05) at 24 °C, indicating that these two related but geographically distinct Tigriopus species have different molecular responses to temperature elevation. Overall, these findings indicate that temperature changes modulate oxidative damage through different modes of action, leading to different types of antioxidant defense in two congeneric copepods.

T1  - Handling times and saturating transmission functions in a snail–worm symbiosis
AN  - 2056072271
AB  - All dynamic species interaction models contain an assumption that describes how contact rates scale with population density. Choosing an appropriate contact–density function is important, because different functions have different implications for population dynamics and stability. However, this choice can be challenging, because there are many possible functions, and most are phenomenological and thus difficult to relate to underlying ecological processes. Using one such phenomenological function, we described a nonlinear relationship between field transmission rates and host density in a common snail–oligochaete symbiosis. We then used a well-known contact function from predator–prey models, the Holling Type II functional response, to describe and predict host snail contact rates in the laboratory. The Holling Type II functional response accurately described both the nonlinear contact–density relationship and the average contact duration that we observed. Therefore, we suggest that contact rates saturate with host density in this system because each snail contact requires a non-instantaneous handling time, and additional possible contacts do not occur during that handling time. Handling times and nonlinear contact rates might also explain the nonlinear relationship between symbiont transmission and snail density that we observed in the field, which could be confirmed by future work that controls for other potential sources of seasonal variation in transmission rates. Because most animal contacts are not instantaneous, the Holling Type II functional response might be broadly relevant to diverse host–symbiont systems.

T1  - Temporal variation in total phosphorus concentrations revealed from a multidecadal monitoring program on Big Platte Lake, Michigan
AN  - 2059445131
AB  - Effective water quality management depends on enactment of appropriately designed monitoring programs to reveal current and forecasted conditions. Because water quality conditions are influenced by numerous factors, commonly measured attributes such as total phosphorus (TP) can be highly temporally varying. For highly varying processes, monitoring programs should be long-term and periodic quantitative analyses are needed so that temporal trends can be distinguished from stochastic variation, which can yield insights into potential modifications to the program. Using generalized additive mixed modeling, we assessed temporal (yearly and monthly) trends and quantified other sources of variation (daily and subsampling) in TP concentrations from a multidecadal depth-specific monitoring program on Big Platte Lake, Michigan. Yearly TP concentrations decreased from the late 1980s to late 1990s before rebounding through the early 2000s. At depths of 2.29 to 13.72 m, TP concentrations have cycled around stationary points since the early 2000s, while at the surface and depths ≥ 18.29 concentrations have continued declining. Summer and fall peaks in TP concentrations were observed at most depths, with the fall peak at deeper depths occurring 1 month earlier than shallower depths. Daily sampling variation (i.e., variation within a given month and year) was greatest at shallowest and deepest depths. Variation in subsamples collected from depth-specific water samples constituted a small fraction of total variation. Based on model results, cost-saving measures to consider for the monitoring program include reducing subsampling of depth-specific concentrations and reducing the number of sampling depths given observed consistencies across the program period.

T1  - Effect of dietary Sargassum wightii and its fucoidan-rich extract on growth, immunity, disease resistance and antimicrobial peptide gene expression in Labeo rohita
AN  - 2623489693
AB  - This work aimed to appraise growth performance, immune responsiveness, bacterial disease resistance and mRNA expression of two antimicrobial peptides in Labeo rohita fingerlings fed diets supplemented with seaweed Sargassum wightii and its fucoidan-rich extract. Two hundred and twenty-five fingerlings were divided into five experimental groups in triplicates, each replicate having 15 fish in a 90-L tank. Different groups were fed with isonitrogenous (35% crude protein) and isoenergetic (1408.16 kJ/100 g) diets containing either 0% fucoidan-rich seaweed extract (FRSE), 1% FRSE, 2% FRSE, 3% seaweed powder and 6% seaweed powder for 60 days. Partial nucleotide sequences of the antimicrobial peptides, hepcidin and defensin, were characterized in Labeo rohita fingerlings, and gene expression in the different tissues of experimental fish was studied. The fish-fed FRSE-supplemented diets showed significant increase (P < 0.05) in the mRNA expression of antimicrobial peptides in liver, skin and intestine tissues. Bacterial challenge study using Aeromonas hydrophila showed higher survival in the FRSE-fed groups. Fish-fed FRSE-supplemented diets also showed better non-specific immune response (NBT reduction, serum lysozyme activity, serum albumin: globulin ratio and phagocytic activity) in pre-challenge and post-challenge periods. No significant difference was observed in the growth performance in the different experimental groups. The study indicates that although dietary FRSE is a potential immunostimulant in Labeo rohita fingerlings, it does not improve growth performance.

T1  - Effect of dietary <i>Sargassum wightii</i> and its fucoidan-rich extract on growth, immunity, disease resistance and antimicrobial peptide gene expression in <i>Labeo rohita</i>
AN  - 2033529846
AB  - This work aimed to appraise growth performance, immune responsiveness, bacterial disease resistance and mRNA expression of two antimicrobial peptides in Labeo rohita fingerlings fed diets supplemented with seaweed Sargassum wightii and its fucoidan-rich extract. Two hundred and twenty-five fingerlings were divided into five experimental groups in triplicates, each replicate having 15 fish in a 90-L tank. Different groups were fed with isonitrogenous (35% crude protein) and isoenergetic (1408.16 kJ/100 g) diets containing either 0% fucoidan-rich seaweed extract (FRSE), 1% FRSE, 2% FRSE, 3% seaweed powder and 6% seaweed powder for 60 days. Partial nucleotide sequences of the antimicrobial peptides, hepcidin and defensin, were characterized in Labeo rohita fingerlings, and gene expression in the different tissues of experimental fish was studied. The fish-fed FRSE-supplemented diets showed significant increase (P < 0.05) in the mRNA expression of antimicrobial peptides in liver, skin and intestine tissues. Bacterial challenge study using Aeromonas hydrophila showed higher survival in the FRSE-fed groups. Fish-fed FRSE-supplemented diets also showed better non-specific immune response (NBT reduction, serum lysozyme activity, serum albumin: globulin ratio and phagocytic activity) in pre-challenge and post-challenge periods. No significant difference was observed in the growth performance in the different experimental groups. The study indicates that although dietary FRSE is a potential immunostimulant in Labeo rohita fingerlings, it does not improve growth performance.

T1  - Carotenoid-based skin coloration signals antioxidant defenses in the brown trout (<i>Salmo trutta</i>)
AN  - 2015460376
AB  - Carotenoid-based signals may function as indicators of individual quality because, being exclusively obtained from the diet, they indicate the ability of individuals to intake high-quality food. Moreover, carotenoids are involved in several important physiological functions, including antioxidant defense, so that carotenoid-based colorations have been suggested to reflect the antioxidant status of their bearers. The present correlative, cross-sectional study aimed at investigating if the skin carotenoid-based coloration is a signal of antioxidant defenses in the brown trout (Salmo trutta Linnaeus, 1758). We investigated the relationships between carotenoid-based coloration traits (including the number, density and redness of red spots, as well as the ventral yellowness), and both non-enzymatic (plasma and liver total antioxidant capacity) and enzymatic antioxidant defenses (activity of hepatic superoxide dismutase —SOD, catalase —CAT and glutathione peroxidase —GPx). We found significant positive covariations between antioxidant defenses and carotenoid-based skin coloration, in terms of ventral yellowness. Brown trout individuals displaying intense carotenoid-based coloration (i.e., ventral yellowness) had a high non-enzymatic antioxidant capacity both in plasma and in liver and, interestingly, an elevated activity of hepatic SOD and CAT. Our data suggest that carotenoid-based skin colorations may be considered a signal of individual quality in terms of antioxidant defenses in the brown trout.

T1  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon derivatives in airborne particulate matter: sources, analysis and toxicity
AN  - 1992791053
AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are worldwide pollutants produced mainly during incomplete combustion and pyrolysis of organic substances. PAH derivatives are components with hydrogen on the aromatic ring substituted by carbonyl-, nitro- and hydroxyl-functional groups (N-PAH, O-PAH or OH-PAH), or a group of heterocyclic PAHs containing one sulfur atom in place of a carbon atom in the aromatic ring. PAHs and their derivatives can be either introduced in the atmosphere directly in this form as primary pollutants, or formed by homogenous and heterogeneous oxidation reactions. During the last decades, interest on studying PAH derivatives has increased because derivatives may be more harmful than parent compounds. PAH derivatives have been detected in the atmospheric particulate matter in numerous cities worldwide. PAH derivatives enter living organisms by inhalation, oral ingestion and dermal contact. In vivo and in vitro experiments together with epidemiological studies have shown the toxic effects of PAH derivatives, notably for compounds present in airborne and diesel exhaust particles. Here we review the sources, the mechanisms of formation, the physicochemical properties, the analytical methods, and the toxicological effects of PAHs and their derivatives in airborne particulate matter.

T1  - Practical fertilization procedure and embryonic development of the New Zealand geoduck clam (Panopea zelandica)
AN  - 2030158606
AB  - Cultivation of the geoduck Panopea zelandica (Quoy & Gaimard, 1835) requires knowledge on embryonic development to produce spat in hatcheries. This study investigated the development of P. zelandica embryos at 15°C and 35 ppt and the optimal sperm:egg ratios for fertilization under hatchery conditions. Panopea zelandica broodstock were induced to spawn by serotonin injection. Sperm and eggs were collected and fertilization was conducted at sperm:egg ratios of: 50:1, 100:1, 500:1, 1000:1 and 10,000:1 over 40 min. The optimal sperm:egg ratio was <500:1 and the normal embryo yield at 3 and 18 h post-fertilization (hpf) ranged from 83-96%. Panopea zelandica eggs (~80[...]m diameter) developed the first and second polar bodies within 15-20 and 50-55 min post-fertilization, respectively. The blastula appeared at ~8 hpf, including the XR and XL cells and the presumptive shell field depression. Gastrulation occurred at 12-18 hpf with organic material apparent at the shell field depression. The mid-stage trochophore, which appeared at around 35 hpf had an apical plate with an apical tuft. The shell field spread to form the periostracum, which expanded and folded into right and left segments covering the late trochophore. The early D-stage veliger appeared at 45 hpf with the soft body being enclosed by two valves and the appearance of the velum. These observations will serve as the basis for future analyses of P. zelandica embryogenesis and for optimization of commercial production of D-veliger larvae.

T1  - Association of textile industry effluent with mutagenicity and its toxic health implications upon acute and sub-chronic exposure
AN  - 2009201051
AB  - Complex industrial discharges pose certain risks to the ecosystem. This study was aimed at identifying acute and sub-chronic toxicological effects of the textile industry wastewater. The textile wastewater was evaluated for the metals and organic pollutants by atomic absorption spectrophotometer and GC-MS respectively. In vitro genotoxicity and mutagenicity were assessed by Comet assay in peripheral lymphocytes isolated from Ovis aries and Ames test in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA-100 and 102 respectively. Physiological and behavioral changes along with systemic toxicity were determined in Rattus norvegicus albinus following acute and sub-chronic exposure. High amount of heavy metals such as Cr, Pb, Hg, As, and Cd were detected in textile wastewater. Organic pollutants such as 25-deacetoxy cucurbitacin-b, E-14-Hexadecenal, 11-Tricosene, and phthalates were also found. In vitro genotoxicity assessment in lymphocytes showed statistically significant DNA damaging potential of textile wastewater. Textile wastewater also showed significantly higher (p˂ 0.05) mutagenic potential in Salmonella TA-100 and TA-102 strains than sodium azide and 2-amino anthracycline. Acute exposure of textile wastewater to Rattus norvegicus was associated with several physiological changes and behavioral symptoms. Sub-chronic exposure of textile wastewater in Rattus norvegicus instigated the degeneration and necrosis of epithelial cells in renal tubules, hydropic degeneration and necrosis of hepatocytes, peri-bronchiolar infiltration and emphysema of the alveoli, and the degradation of myocardial cells. This study concludes that the textile wastewater may cause genotoxicity and mutagenicity, result in physiological and behavioral changes upon acute exposure, and inflict various pathological lesions upon sub-chronic exposure.

AB  - AMD toxicity was evaluated using water quality and land use bioassays. In particular, we determined concentrations for lethal and sublethal effects as part of the risk assessment process. Lactuca sativa (lettuce), Raphanus sativus (radish), and Triticum aestivum (wheat) were used to predict phytotoxic effects caused by metals, as oxidative stress inhibits germination. The results, expressed as the fraction of AMD resulting in 50% lethality (LC50) at 144 h, showed that wheat was more tolerant (LC50 = 62%) than radish (LC50 = 17.0%) or lettuce (LC50 = 21%). The AMD was found to be very toxic to Daphnia magna (cladoceran) and Danio rerio (zebrafish) embryos, two of the best model organisms in aquatic ecology and ecotoxicology (LC50 <1%). However, when EDTA was used to chelate the metals, the animal toxicity effects was essentially eliminated, pointing to metal content as the main driver of toxicity. Analysis of two molecular biomarkers for an organic pollutant’s toxicity, cyp19a1b and cyp1a, showed no activation of either gene, further indicating that the toxicity was mainly associated with the metals. The results also suggest that the environmental risk associated with the AMD could be largely mitigated by relatively cheap and simple measures to reduce metal mobility, like liming.Alternate abstract:Die Toxizität saurer Grubenwässer wurde durch Wasserqualitäts- und Biomasse-Untersuchungen bewertet. Im Besonderen bestimmten wir die tödlichen und sublethalen Effekte als Teil des Risikoabschätzungs-Prozesses. Lactuca sativa (Salat), Raphanus sativus (Rettich), and Triticum aestivum (Weizen) wurden zur Vorhersage der phytotoxischen Effekte benutzt, die durch Metalle als oxidative Belastung die Keimung behindern. Im Ergebnis, ausgedrückt in der 50% Toxizität (LC50) nach 144 Stunden Exposition mit saurem Grubenwässern, konnte gezeigt werden, dass Weizen (LC50 = 62%) wesentlich toleranter ist als Rettich (LC50 = 17%) oder Salat (LC50 = 21%). Es wurde herausgefunden, dass saure Grubenwässer sehr toxisch sind gegenüber Daphnia magna (Cladocaeen) und Danio rerio (Zebrafisch) Embryonen, zwei der am besten geeigneten Indikator-Organismen für die wasserwirtschaftliche Ökologie und Ökotoxologie (LC50 < 1%). Nachdem EDTA eingesetzt wurde um die Metalle durch Komplexbildung zu binden, wurden die toxischen Effekte nachhaltig eliminiert und dies zeigte deutlich, dass die Metallgehalte die Hauptursache für die die Giftigkeit sind. Die Analyse von zwei molekularen Biomarkern für die organische Verschmutzung, cyp19a1b und cyp1a, zeigten keine Aktivierung der anderen Gene und gaben damit einen weiteren Hinweis, dass die Giftigkeit hauptsächlich von den Metallen verursacht wird. Die Ergebnisse lassen die Schlussfolgerung zu, dass die Umweltrisiken aus den sauren Grubenwässern abgeschwächt werden können durch relativ preiswerte und einfache Maßnahmen zur Reduzierung der Metalle wie der Bekalkung.Alternate abstract:La toxicidad de drenaje ácido de minas se evaluó utilizando bioensayos de calidad de agua y uso de suelo. En particular, se determinaron las concentraciones para efectos letales y subletales como parte de un proceso de relevamiento de riesgo. Se utilizó Lactuca sativa (lechuga), Raphanus sativus (rábano) y Triticum aestivum (trigo) para predecir los efectos fitotóxicos causados por los metales como la inhibición germinativa por estrés oxidativo. Los resultados, expresados como la fracción de drenaje que provocó 50% de letalidad (LC50) a las 144 h, mostró que el trigo fue más tolerante (LC50 = 62%) que el rábano (LC50 = 17,0%) o la lechuga (LC50 = 21%). El drenaje resultó muy tóxico para embriones de Daphnia magna (cladocero) y de Danio rerio (pez cebra), dos de los mejores organismos modelos en ecología acuática y ecotoxicología (LC50 < 1%). No obstante, cuando se utilizó EDTA para quelar los metales, los efectos tóxicos fueron esencialmente eliminados indicando que el contenido metálico fue el principal responsable de la toxicidad. El análisis de dos biomarcadores moleculares para toxicidad de contaminantes orgánicos, cyp19a1b y cyp1a, no mostró activación de ningún gen, indicando que la toxicidad estuvo principalmentne asociada a los metales. Los resultados también sugirieron que el riesgo ambiental asociado con el drenaje acido de minas puede ser mayoritariamente mitigado por medidas relativamente baratas y simples, como el agregado de cal, para reducir la movilidad de los metales.Alternate abstract:摘要采用水质和土壤生物测定法评价酸性矿山废水毒性。尤其确定了风险评价的致死和亚致死浓度。菊科莴苣(lettuce)、十字花科萝卜(radish)和普通小麦(wheat)用以预测金属氧化抑制发芽的植物毒性。矿山废水引起的144小时50%致死率(LC50)结果表明,小麦(LC50=62%)比萝卜(LC50=17.0%)或莴苣(LC50=21%)耐性更强。酸性矿山废水对大型水蚤(cladoceran)和斑马鱼(zebrafish)胚胎毒性很强,它们是两种最好的水生生态学与生态毒性学模型生物(LC50<1%)。然而,当用乙二胺四乙酸(EDTA) 螯合金属离子时,动物毒性影响基本消失,表明金属含量为控制毒性的主要驱动因素。脑芳香化酶(cyp19a1b)和细胞色素氧化酶(cyp1a)两种有机污染物毒性分子生物标记的分析表明,二者基传因子未被活化,毒性主要与金属离子相关。结果亦表明,灰浸等简单、经济的金属活性抑制措施能缓解酸性矿山废水相关的环境风险。

AB  - On August 19, 2016, Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks (FWP) completely closed a 183-mile section of the Yellowstone (and its tributaries) to all water-based recreation from the Yellowstone National Park boundary to the Highway 212 bridge in Laurel, Montana.

Due in part to the Yellowstone PKD episode, but largely because the Tiber and Canyon Ferry reservoirs tested positive for invasive aquatic mussels, Montana's legislature passed Senate Bill 363, which requires all resident and nonresident anglers to purchase an Aquatic Invasive Species Prevention Pass.

Two foreign-owned mining companies (Lucky Minerals and Crevice Mining Group) are vying to mine gold beside the Yellowstone River near Paradise Valley's Emigrant Peak and near Jardine just a half mile outside of the park's north gate.

[...]it's incomprehensible madness to allow gold mines on the banks of the Yellowstone River just outside the boundaries of our nation's first national park.

Simms has produced a Save Our Yellowstone River shirt, with a portion of the proceeds going to the Greater Yellowstone Coalition, a vital conservation group founded in 1983, dedicated to protecting and preserving the lands, waters, and wildlife that surround Yellowstone National Park.

T1  - A Hybrid Lagrangian–Eulerian Particle Model for Ecosystem Simulation
AN  - 2582824878
AB  - Current numerical methods for simulating biophysical processes in aquatic environments are typically constructed in a grid-based Eulerian framework or as an individual-based model in a particle-based Lagrangian framework. Often, the biogeochemical processes and physical (hydrodynamic) processes occur at different time and space scales, and changes in biological processes do not affect the hydrodynamic conditions. Therefore, it is possible to develop an alternative strategy to grid-based approaches for linking hydrodynamic and biogeochemical models that can significantly improve computational efficiency for this type of linked biophysical model. In this work, we utilize a new technique that links hydrodynamic effects and biological processes through a property-carrying particle model (PCPM) in a Lagrangian/Eulerian framework. The model is tested in idealized cases and its utility is demonstrated in a practical application to Sandusky Bay. Results show the integration of Lagrangian and Eulerian approaches allows for a natural coupling of mass transport (represented by particle movements and random walk) and biological processes in water columns which is described by a nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton-detritus (NPZD) biological model. This method is far more efficient than traditional tracer-based Eulerian biophysical models for 3-D simulation, particularly for a large domain and/or ensemble simulations.

T1  - Isolation and characterization of new microsatellite markers for the Pacific geoduck (Panopea generosa) using next generation sequencing
AN  - 2186651132
AB  - Background Panopea generosa is a large and long-lived infaunal clam with a considerable commercial value in Canada, United States and Mexico, in need of population genetic studies across its range of distribution. Goals We set to develop new genetic markers (microsatellites) specific for P. generosa. Methods We tested 30 microsatellite loci generated using next-generation genome sequencing (Illumina Hi-Seq 2500). Results We identified eight as suitable polymorphic genetic markers. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 5 to 22 and heterozygosity from 0.429 to 0.818 (observed) and from 0.548 to 0.962 (expected). Deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was found in three loci, after Dunn-[amp]#352;idák correction, as a result of heterozygote deficiencies suggesting the presence of null alleles and linkage disequilibrium was found between two loci. Conclusions These markers are highly informative and useful for population genetic studies aimed at informing management and conservation measures of this valuable resource.

T1  - Exploring Dynamics of the Chlorophyll <i>a</i>-Total Phosphorus Relationship at the Lake-Specific Scale: a Bayesian Hierarchical Model
AN  - 1985281646
AB  - Lake eutrophication has become a worldwide challenge, and the empirical chlorophyll a-total phosphorus (Chla-TP) relationship provides a management target for TP concentrations. Neglecting the dynamics of the relationship at the lake-specific scale would mislead the eutrophication control strategy. The Bayesian hierarchical model (BHM) is a flexible tool to explore dynamics of the Chla-TP relationship and improves the overall estimation accuracy by partial pooling of data. In this study, we used the BHM to show the spatial and seasonal dynamics of the Chla-TP relationship in one of the most eutrophic lakes in China (Lake Dianchi). We defined an indicator (the Chla/TP ratio, CPR), to represent the susceptibility of Chla to TP. We conducted a model selection process and used the CPR-TP curves to show the spatial and seasonal dynamics of the Chla-TP relationships. We determined that the wind caused the spatial dynamics due to the horizontal transport of phytoplankton, while the water temperature and the percentage of soluble reactive phosphorus led to the seasonal dynamics via increasing the growth rate of phytoplankton. These findings helped the eutrophication control in Lake Dianchi. We found that compared with the strategy to decrease the TP concentration, decreasing the susceptibility is expected to be more effective. Finally, we concluded that exploring the dynamics of the Chla-TP relationship provided an important basis for eutrophication control at the lake-specific scale.

T1  - Cellular and molecular responses of adult zebrafish after exposure to CuO nanoparticles or ionic copper
AN  - 1965518937
AB  - Due to their antimicrobial, electrical and magnetic properties, copper nanoparticles (NPs) are suitable for a vast array of applications. Copper can be toxic to biota, making it necessary to assess the potential hazard of copper nanomaterials. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed to 10 µg Cu/L of CuO NPs of ≈100 nm (CuO-poly) or ionic copper to compare the effects provoked after 3 and 21 days of exposure and at 6 months post-exposure (mpe). At 21 days, significant copper accumulation was only detected in fish exposed to ionic copper. Exposure to both copper forms caused histopathological alterations that could reduce gill functionality, more markedly in the case of ionic copper. Nevertheless, at 6 mpe higher prevalences of gill lesions were detected in fish previously exposed to CuO-poly NPs. No relevant histological alterations were detected in liver, but the lysosomal membrane stability test showed significantly impaired general health status after exposure to both metal forms that lasted up to 6 mpe. 69 transcripts appeared regulated after 3 days of exposure to CuO-poly NPs, suggesting that NPs could produce oxidative stress and reduce metabolism and transport processes. Thirty transcripts were regulated after 21 days of exposure to ionic copper, indicating possible DNA damage. Genes of the circadian clock were identified as the key genes involved in time-dependent differences between the two copper forms. In conclusion, each copper form showed a distinct pattern of liver transcriptome regulation, but both caused gill histopathological alterations and long lasting impaired health status in adult zebrafish.

T1  - Identification and risk assessment of human and veterinary antibiotics in the wastewater treatment plants and the adjacent sea in Tunisia
AN  - 1984322384
AB  - In the following study, we came up with and validated a prompt, sensitive and precise method for the simultaneous determination of 56 antimicrobial drugs (tetracyclines, sulfonamides, β-lactams, macrolides and quinolones) using the ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). This method was implemented with success to determine antibiotics in samples collected from four wastewater treatment plants and five coasts in Tunisia. Results showed the presence of high concentrations of antibiotics that ranged from 0.1 to 646 ng mL−1, which can induce many negative impacts on health and the environment. For this reason, we have opted to evaluate toxicity of wastewater samples using a battery of biotests. In fact, genotoxicity was assessed using three tests: Vitotox, comet and micronucleus assays. The input and output of wastewater treatment plants induced a strongly genotoxic effect on the Salmonella typhimurium TA104 prokaryotic Vitotox assay. This result was confirmed using the comet and the micronucleus assays performed on the human liver hepatocellular carcinoma cells. The genotoxic power of the tested wastewater treatment plants' samples could be attributed to the presence of the higher quantities of antibiotics that are detected in these samples and to the antibiotic and organic compound cocktails.

T1  - Relationships between environmental factors and biological parameters of Asian wedge clam, Donax scortum, morphometric analysis, length-weight relationship and condition index: a first report in Asia
AN  - 1963838367
AB  - Wedge clam, Donax scortum occurrence was studied from February 2009 to January 2010 in Padukere sandy beach, Karnataka (India). The following biological parameters were measured in 2367 individuals of the wedge clam, Donax scortum: length, breadth, width, total weight, shell weight, wet meat weight, dry meat weight and number of clams. The calculated linear equation of length-breadth and length-width relationships were B = 3.5968 + 0.5421L and W = 0.8191 + 0.4345L respectively. The length-total weight, length-wet meat weight, length-dry meat weight and length-shell weight relationships were 0.0001414L3.0224, W = 0.0000037L3.5204, W = 0.0000011L3.4513 and 0.0000852L2.9912 respectively. The values of correlation coefficient for different shell dimensional relationships were very close to unity. It was clear from the study that the most ideal period for clam harvest was April, June and December, especially when condition index was maximum. Length showed a strong correlation with silt and clay. Dry meat weight was negatively correlated with air temperature. Shell weight showed positive correlation with length, breadth, width and dry meat weight, and abiotic parameters, silt and clay. Condition index was positively correlated with electrical conductivity, whereas it was negatively correlated with dissolved oxygen. It showed a strong positive correlation with salinity. Seasonal fluctuation of condition index in D. scortum was probably related to reproductive activity. The harvesting of wedge clam could be carried out considering the maximum sustainable yield without over-exploitation

T1  - Cadmium effects on some energy metabolism variables in Cnesterodon decemmaculatus adults
AN  - 1957707291
AB  - This work is focused on the responses of some energy metabolism variables in Cnesterodon decemmaculatus adults exposed to cadmium under controlled laboratory conditions. This species has been used as bioindicator for evaluating the effects of different chemicals on diverse biological processes and is frequently used as test organism in ecotoxicity studies that include cadmium as reference toxicant. Animals were exposed for 12 days to the following concentrations: 0, 0.45, and 0.8 mg Cd/L. Food intake, fecal production, specific assimilation, condition factor, mortality percentage, oxygen consumption, oxygen extraction efficiency, specific metabolic rate, ammonia excretion, and ammonia quotient were measured. The overall balance was expressed as scope for growth (SFG). Cadmium-exposed groups showed a significant decrease in food assimilation and condition factor at the end of the exposure. There was an increase in specific metabolic rate and a decrease in SFG in the group exposed to 0.8 mg Cd/L. The condition factor and the SFG appeared as sensitive biomarkers of health status and growth of the animals, respectively. Cadmium-exposed fish reduced food intake, which was reflected in a decreased assimilation with concomitant decline in the external energy supply from feeding. Our results highlight the importance of considering the metabolic status of the test organisms when analyzing the responses of the biomarkers usually used as effect parameters in ecotoxicological evaluations under experimental conditions.

T1  - Excretion by Benthic Invertebrates as Important Source of Phosphorus in Oligotrophic Ecosystem (Lake Krivoe, Northern Russia)
TT  - Эκсκреция бентосных беспозвоночных κаκ важный источниκ фосфора в эκосистеме олиготрофного озера
AN  - 2007092704
AB  - We studied contribution of benthic invertebrates to the dissolved phosphates flux from the bottom sediments to the water in an oligotrophic lake (Lake Krivoe, near the White Sea biological station "Kartesh", Northern European Russia) in 2009-2013 with the aim to quantify specific (among and within taxa), spatial (littoral and deep sites) and seasonal variability. The excretion rates (Pexc) of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) were estimated in experiment with dominating taxa of benthic invertebrates (amphipods, oligochaetes, mollusks, and chironomids), freshly collected from the lake. Mass-specific P excretion rate was calculated as Pexc divided by animal dry mass and further used for calculations of benthic P efflux rates. Also, in other experimental series with and without animals (amphipods) we measured extracellular alkaline phosphatase activity. The results showed that the SRP excretion rates varied significantly between taxa and between different-sized individuals within the same taxa (the SRP excretion rate elevates with an increase in individual weight). Notable spatial and seasonal differences in biomass of benthic animals and phosphorus released by them in the lake were found. The calculated phosphorus efflux by excretory activity of benthic animals was more intensive in littoral sites (up to 14.4 nmol m-2d-1 in July), that 7 times greater than maximum efflux in deep areas (2.2 nmol m-2d-1). The mobile burrowing animals (the amphipods Gammarus lacustris, Monoporeia affinis, and Gammaracanthus loricatus) are able to move from the bottom sediments to water and transfer the nutrient; they contributed 80 % of P flux caused by benthic excretion in the lake and affected the activity of the extracellular alkaline phosphatase, increasing its level in water 3-8 times relative to that in the control (without animals). The high phosphatase activity may increase phosphorus bioavailability by catalyzing hydrolysis of organic phosphorus, and further stimulate primary producers.

T1  - Size fraction of phytoplankton and the contribution of natural plankton to the carbon source of Zhikong scallop Chlamys farreri in mariculture ecosystem of the Sanggou Bay
AN  - 1945711585
AB  - The biomass and size fraction of phytoplankton in terms of chlorophyll a (Chl a) was measured during four cruises conducted in April, July, October 2013 and January 2014 in mariculture area, the Sanggou Bay, China. Results show that total Chl a levels in the surface seawater of the Sanggou Bay generally range from 0.10 to 20.46 μg/L, with an average value of 2.13 μg/L. Nano-phytoplankton was the most important size-fraction and accounted for about 65.1% of total Chl a. In order to evaluate the importance of the “protozoan trophic link” for energy transfer from the microbial loop to filter-feeding feeders, Zhikong scallop Chlamys farreri was then offered a natural planktonic community as potential prey. Results show that scallops obtained carbon source from natural plankton with the rate of 11 033.05 μg/(g·d). Protists (nanoflagellates and ciliates) were the dominant source of carbon retained by scallop (48.78%). The microbial loop provided 58.45% of the carbon source for farmed scallops. These results indicate that the microbial loop represent a valuable trophic resource in mariculture system of the Sanggou Bay.

T1  - Two Pisidium species inhabit freshwater lakes of Novaya Zemlya Archipelago: the first molecular evidence
AN  - 1943035782
AB  - The information regarding freshwater mollusks of water bodies of Novaya Zemlya Archipelago is extremely limited. In 2015, the study of the lakes of the Southern Island of Novaya Zemlya Archipelago was undertaken within the framework of the research expedition of the “Arctic Floating University”. In general, two bivalve species were found in the lakes, Pisidium cf. conventus (Clessin, 1877) and P. waldeni (Kuiper, 1975). It is a northernmost record for Pisidium in the Palearctic Region. The present study provides the first occurrence of P. waldeni on the Novaya Zemlya Archipelago. The results of molecular analyses show that P. cf. conventus from Svyatoe Lake clusters together with the clade Odhneripisidium Kuiper, 1962. Our data are in accordance with the tabula rasa hypothesis, which states that the contemporary freshwater invertebrate fauna of the Novaya Zemlya originates through recent immigration processes after the Last Glacial Maximum.

T1  - Development and application of a sustainability index for a lake ecosystem
AN  - 1923613703
AB  - We modify an existing water quality index of Lake Kinneret to better match the objective of sustaining the ecosystem over time. The Kinneret Sustainability Index (KSI) provides a quantitative indication of how similar the current ecosystem is in relation to a reference state that managers are striving to achieve and sustain once accomplished. As Lake Kinneret is the only freshwater lake in Israel, it is vital to sustain the lake ecosystem over time. The KSI provides lake managers with a means for assessing the state of the lake. The KSI is based on nine ecosystem variables and provides information on each variable and the combined index. We present examples of application of the KSI to lake management and conduct a sensitivity analysis of the underlying assumptions demonstrating its robustness to the assumptions. While the index presented here is specific to Lake Kinneret, it is a general approach that can be readily applied to lakes worldwide and can assist, for example, in achievement of the required good status for European lakes.

T1  - Bio-optical Properties of Cyanobacteria Blooms in Western Lake Erie
AN  - 2307835976
AB  - There is a growing use of remote sensing observations for detecting and quantifying freshwater cyanobacteria populations, yet the inherent optical properties of these communities in natural settings, fundamental to bio-optical algorithms, are not well known. Towards bridging this knowledge gap, we measured a full complement of optical properties in western Lake Erie during cyanobacteria blooms in the summers of 2013 and 2014. Our measurements focus attention on the optical uniqueness of cyanobacteria blooms, which have consequences for remote sensing and bio-optical modeling. We found the cyanobacteria blooms in the western basin during our field work were dominated by Microcystis, while the waters in the adjacent central basin were dominated by Planktothrix. Chlorophyll concentrations ranged from 1 to over 135 ${\mu}g/L$ across the study area with the highest concentrations associated with Microcystis in the western basin. We observed large, amorphous colonial Microcystis structures in the bloom area characterized by high phytoplankton absorption and high scattering coefficients with a mean particle backscatter ratio at 443nm greater than 0.03, which is higher than other plankton types and more comparable to suspended inorganic sediments. While our samples contained mixtures of both, our analysis suggests high contributions to the measured scatter and backscatter coefficients from cyanobacteria. Our measurements provide new insights into the optical properties of cyanobacteria blooms, and indicate that current semi-analytic models are likely to have problems resolving a closed solution in these types of waters as many of our observations are beyond the range of existing model components. We believe that different algorithm or model approaches are needed for these conditions, specifically for phytoplankton absorption and particle backscatter components. From a remote sensing perspective, this presents a challenge not only in terms of a need for new algorithms, but also for determining when to apply the best algorithm for a given situation. These results are new in the sense that they represent a complete description of the optical properties of freshwater cyanobacteria blooms, and are likely to be representative of bloom conditions for other systems containing Microcystis cells and colonies.

T1  - Data pre-treatment and choice of resemblance metric affect how fatty acid profiles depict known dietary origins
AN  - 1934537094
AB  - Fatty acids (FA) are increasingly being used in ecology to qualitatively infer diets of consumers. Analysis of FA data requires standardization to express FAs either in mg g-1 lipids, mg g-1 tissue, or as percentages of the total mass of FAs. Additionally, various transformations [square root, arcsin, log(X + 1), log-ratio, etc.] are often used to differentially weight the contribution of less abundant FAs. The choice of standardization unit and transformation can affect interpretations of results and ultimately our understanding of trophic relationships. Data from published feeding experiments were analyzed with visualization (i.e., nMDS) and multivariate rank-based methods (i.e. Mantel Tests) to evaluate how choice of standardization, transformation, and resemblance metric (i.e., Euclidean distance, Bray-Curtis similarities, etc.) reflects known dietary treatment groups. Our results indicate that diet interpretations were best inferred from data standardized to the total mass of FAs quantified. We found transforming data provided only weak advantages for discriminating among diet groups. Euclidean distances between FA proportions represented the known dietary differences to a high degree, are relatively easily interpretable, are applicable to a wide variety of statistical techniques, and are thus a reasonable choice of metric when analyzing FA proportions.

T1  - Whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) Response to Varying Potassium and Sodium Concentrations: A Model of Mining Water Toxic Response
AN  - 1930222364
AB  - Boreal waters are typically low in minerals and oligotrophic, and therefore particularly sensitive to changes in mineral composition. We investigated the  effects of potassium and the potassium: sodium (K+: Na+) ratio in freshwater on growth performance and oxidative stress in a typical northern species of whitefish, Coregonus lavaretus. Fish were subjected to 0.8 mM Na and 4.4  mM  K, which  corresponds to the K+:Na+ ratio in a lake contaminated by mining wastes from the  Kostomuksha iron mine  and ore dressing mill  in  northwestern Russia.The  control  group was subjected to water with similar mineralization levels and equal amounts of Na and  K approximately 0.3  mM of each). Potassium excess caused a decrease in fish growth rate  and  oxidative  stress, as indicated by the level of lipid peroxidation product  malondialdehyde  (MDA).  Glutathione-S-transferase  (GST)  activity and  the  level of reduced glutathione  (GSH) were not affected by cation composition.

T1  - Silver nanoparticles cause osmoregulatory impairment and oxidative stress in Caspian kutum (Rutilus kutum, Kamensky 1901)
AN  - 1927739184
AB  - Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are increasingly used in several industrial and household products because of their antibacterial and antifungal properties. Hence, there is an inevitable risk that these chemicals may end up in aquatic biotopes and have adverse effects on the fauna. In order to assess potential health effects on aquatic organisms, this study evaluated the effects of waterborne AgNP exposure for 7 days on a set of critical stress parameters in juvenile Caspian kutum (Rutilus kutum), an economically important fish in the Caspian Sea. The applied level 11 [mu]g/l of AgNP is high compared to reported water concentrations and corresponds to 40% of the 96 h LC50 value, initially determined to be 28 [mu]g/l. Gill heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) mRNA expression, Na+/K+-ATPase activity and enzymatic activities of liver superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (Gpx), lactate dehyrogenase (LDH) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and whole-body cortisol and thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) were measured as endpoints. Gill hsp70 mRNA expression increased and gill Na+/K+-ATPase activity decreased in AgNP-exposed fish compared to controls. The specific activities of all liver enzymes decreased significantly compared to controls. Whole-body cortisol and thyroid hormones decreased compared to controls. In conclusion, the study demonstrates that AgNPs cause oxidative stress and gill osmoregulatory disruption in Caspian kutum juveniles.

T1  - Influence of diet and ambient water on hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope ratios in fish tissue: patterns within and among tissues and relationships with growth rates
AN  - 1918796794
AB  - The influence of food and ambient water on 2H and 18O isotopic composition in fish soft tissues, how growth affects tissue-specific composition, and relationships of isotope values within and among tissues are poorly known. We exposed age-0 largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) to ambient water and food with known δ2H and δ18O values for 65 days and analyzed liver and muscle for δ2H and δ18O levels. Liver δ2H but not δ18O was influenced by water isotopic concentrations and neither ratio was influenced by the isotopic composition of food. In contrast, water and food affected muscle δ2H, whereas muscle δ18O was only influenced by water isotopic values. We observed relationships between fish growth and muscle δ2H and δ18O, where increased growth led muscle to come closer into equilibrium with food and water isotope values, but found no relationships with growth and either liver δ2H or δ18O. Ratios of 2H and 18O were positively related within muscle and within liver of individuals, as were δ2H values between liver and muscle and δ18O values between tissues. Studies assessing 2H and 18O in temperate fishes should account for isotopic contributions from water and food and consider consequences of fish growth and timing of sample collection.

T1  - Relationships among cyanobacteria, zooplankton and fish in sub-bloom conditions in the Sulejow Reservoir
AN  - 2417819978
AB  - The occurrence of cyanobacteria is particularly characteristic of shallow eutrophic waters, and they often form massive ‘blooms’ that can affect aquatic invertebrates and fish. However, even a low abundance of cyanobacteria can be hazardous to aquatic organisms, due to the production of toxic metabolites. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between cyanobacteria and their toxicity (biological activity) towards zooplankton and fish communities, when only low concentrations of cyanobacterial chlorophyll a (less than 20 μg L-1) are detected, i.e. in sub-bloom conditions. Measurements were performed in Sulejow Reservoir (Central Poland), a shallow, lowland, eutrophic reservoir, in which cyanobacterial blooms occur regularly. Fish were assessed using echo-sounding (distribution) and by gillnetting (species composition). Simultaneously, zooplankton, cyanobacteria and physico-chemical characteristics were studied at 14 stations situated along hydroacoustic transects. Parameters that characterized the cyanobacteria (cyanobacterial chlorophyll a concentration, the number of 16S rRNA and the mcyA gene copies and microcystin (MC) concentration) were consistently correlated (based on a principal component analysis), and the highest values were found in the downstream region of the study area. This ‘cyano-complex’ was also positively correlated with oxygen concentration, pH and phosphate levels, but was negatively correlated with temperature and the concentrations of nitrates and nitrites. In Sulejow Reservoir in 2013 the biomass of large zooplankton filter feeders decreased along with increasing MC concentration and fish densities, while small filter feeders did not present such relationships with regards to fish densities. Fish abundance tended to decrease at stations with a lower abundance of cyanobacteria and with growing toxic genotype copies and MC concentration.

T1  - Revisited Syllidae of the English Channel coarse sediment communities
AN  - 1946517293
AB  - Among the polychaetes, the Syllidae comprise numerous species whose study over many years has benefitted from valuable revisions and descriptions of new species in Europe. This abundant literature proves very useful for revisiting the taxonomy and distribution of the Syllidae in the English Channel (EC), mainly as regards existing studies on coarse sediment communities in the eastern part of the Channel. This habitat is one of the most widespread in the EC and is known as favourable for the small polychaete fauna including Syllidae. A 2-year survey (winter and summer sampling periods) covering 19 stations, associated with the Branchiostoma lanceolatum coarse sand community offshore Dieppe-Le Tréport, led to the identification of 6537 individuals from 29 taxa including 27 species. Six fine sand stations were also sampled in which only 12 individuals were collected. Among these species, seven are new for the EC polychaete fauna and six others are observed for the first time in the eastern part of the EC. All the new species for the EC are warm temperate species previously only known south of the Bay of Biscay. The Syllidae list given in Dauvin et al. (2003) has been re-analysed and amended with our list and that of the Chausey Archipelago study (Olivier et al., 2012). To date, 91 Syllidae species have been recorded in the EC and are established mostly in coarse sediments.

T1  - Fitness Evaluation of Ruditapes philippinarum Exposed to Ni
AN  - 1899605429
AB  - In this study, long-term effects of Ni, a widespread heavy metal in the aquatic ecosystems, have been determined on growth and lethality of the clam Ruditapes philippinarum, a known bioindicator of the marine environment. Three/four-month-old bivalves have been exposed to different concentrations of Ni dissolved in synthetic seawater. Growth and lethality as endpoints after 28 days of treatment have been observed. Obtained results are the following: EC25 = 3.97 ± 0.94 and 9.45 ± 1.59 mg/L and NOEC = 1.56 and 6.25 mg/L for growth and mortality, respectively. Moreover, this study can be considered a new tool for the evaluation of fitness of bivalve clam, together with other biological responses following to the biological impacts of metal pollution.

T1  - Fixed-Nitrogen Loss Associated with Sinking Zooplankton Carcasses in a Coastal Oxygen Minimum Zone (Golfo Dulce, Costa Rica)
AN  - 2307723737
AB  - Oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) in the ocean are of key importance for pelagic fixed-nitrogen loss (N-loss) through microbial denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox). Recent studies document that zooplankton is surprisingly abundant in and around OMZs and that the microbial community associated with carcasses of a large copepod species mediates denitrification. Here, we investigate the complex N-cycling associated with sinking zooplankton carcasses exposed to the steep O2 gradient in a coastal OMZ (Golfo Dulce, Costa Rica). 15N-stable-isotope enrichment experiments revealed that the carcasses of abundant copepods and ostracods provide anoxic microbial hotspots in the pelagic zone by hosting intense anaerobic N-cycle activities even in the presence of ambient O2. Carcass-associated anaerobic N-cycling was clearly dominated by dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) at up to 30.8 nmol NH4+ individual-1 d-1, followed by denitrification (up to 10.8 nmol N2-N individual-1 d-1), anammox (up to 1.6 nmol N2-N individual-1 d-1), and N2O production (up to 1.2 nmol N2O-N individual-1 d-1). In contrast, anaerobic N-cycling mediated by free-living bacteria proceeded mainly through anammox and denitrification in the anoxic bottom water, which underpins the distinctive microbial metabolism associated with zooplankton carcasses. Pelagic N-loss is potentially enhanced by zooplankton carcasses both directly through N2 and N2O production, and indirectly through NH4+ production that may fuel free-living anammox bacteria. We estimate that in the hypoxic water layer of Golfo Dulce, carcass-associated N2 and N2O production enhance N-loss as much as 1.4-fold at a relative carcass abundance of 36%. In the anoxic bottom water, however, N-loss is likely enhanced only marginally due to high ambient rates and low zooplankton abundance. Thus, zooplankton carcasses may enhance N-loss mainly at the hypoxic boundaries of OMZs which are usually more extensive in open-ocean than in coastal settings. Notably, these contributions by zooplankton carcasses to pelagic N-loss remain undetected by conventional, incubation-based rate measurements.

T1  - Environmental factors regulating gaping activity of the bivalve Arctica islandica in Northern Norway
AN  - 1892581132
AB  - Arctica islandica is the longest-living non-colonial animal known at present. It inhabits coastal waters in the North Atlantic and its annual shell increments are widely used for paleoclimatic reconstructions. There is no consensus, however, about the intra-annual timing of its feeding activity and growth. This research aims to identify the main environmental drivers of A. islandica valve gape to clarify the ambiguity surrounding its seasonal activity. A lander was deployed from February 2014 to September 2015 on the sea bottom at Ingøya, Norway (71°03'N, 24°05'E) containing living A. islandica specimens (70.17 ± 0.95 mm SE) in individual containers. Each individual was attached to an electrode unit that measured the distance between their valves (valve gape) every minute. Individuals were followed for various lengths of time, and in some cases replaced by smaller individuals (54.34 ± 0.63 mm SE). The lander was also equipped with instruments to simultaneously monitor temperature, salinity, [Chl-a], turbidity, and light. There was a significant difference in the average monthly valve gape (P value < 0.01), with monthly means of 19-84% of the total valve gape magnitude. The experimental population was largely inactive October-January, with an average daily gape <23%. During this period the clams opened at high amplitude once or twice a month for 1-3 days. Seasonal cycles of sea water temperature and [Chl-a] were temporally offset from each other, with temperature lagging [Chl-a] by about 2 months. Multiple regression analyses showed that bivalve gaping activity was most closely correlated with variable [Chl-a], and to a much smaller degree with photoperiod and temperature.

T1  - Comparative transcriptomics reveals genes involved in metabolic and immune pathways in the digestive gland of scallop Chlamys farreri following cadmium exposure
AN  - 1883505087
AB  - Chlamys farreri is an economically important mollusk that can accumulate excessive amounts of cadmium (Cd). Studying the molecular mechanism of Cd accumulation in bivalves is difficult because of the lack of genome background. Transcriptomic analysis based on high-throughput RNA sequencing has been shown to be an efficient and powerful method for the discovery of relevant genes in non-model and genome reference-free organisms. Here, we constructed two cDNA libraries (control and Cd exposure groups) from the digestive gland of C. farreri and compared the transcriptomic data between them. A total of 227 673 transcripts were assembled into 105 071 unigenes, most of which shared high similarity with sequences in the NCBI non-redundant protein database. For functional classification, 24 493 unigenes were assigned to Gene Ontology terms. Additionally, EuKaryotic Ortholog Groups and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses assigned 12 028 unigenes to 26 categories and 7 849 unigenes to five pathways, respectively. Comparative transcriptomics analysis identified 3 800 unigenes that were differentially expressed in the Cd-treated group compared with the control group. Among them, genes associated with heavy metal accumulation were screened, including metallothionein, divalent metal transporter, and metal tolerance protein. The functional genes and predicted pathways identified in our study will contribute to a better understanding of the metabolic and immune system in the digestive gland of C. farreri. In addition, the transcriptomic data will provide a comprehensive resource that may contribute to the understanding of molecular mechanisms that respond to marine pollutants in bivalves.

T1  - Histopathology conditions of cultured oyster, Crassostrea iredalei from southern and east Malaysia
AN  - 2056433293
AB  - This is a histopathologic survey of cultured oysters, Crassostrea iredalei in Southern Malaysian state and East Malaysia, where incidents of mass mortalities of oysters occurred in 2012. A total of 48 samples of C. iredalei were sampled from both locations. The samples were examined for macroscopic symptoms and were processed for histological study. The collected oysters had similar average shell length between Johor (8.73±0.46 cm) and Sabah (8.75±0.66 cm), respectively. The histopathology examination revealed hypertrophy, hyperplasia, necrosis, thinning of structure such as digestive diverticula, presence of granulocytomas and granulation tissue. "Lesion", "Accumulation of brown cells" and "Hemocyte accumulation" were more severe in Sabah samples compared to Johor samples, except for "Oocysts of Nematopsis sp.". The only pathogen found in this study was Nematopsis sp. and higher prevalence of Nematopsis sp. was found in Johor samples. This study for the first time, documented the histopathology of the sub-population of cultured oysters from two main culture areas in Malaysia, despite the low number of samples.

T1  - Different effects of blue and red light-emitting diodes on antioxidant responses in the liver and ovary of zebrafish Danio rerio
AN  - 1882360978
AB  - The present study assessed the effects of a white fluorescent bulb (the control) and two different light-emitting diodes (blue LEDs, LDB; red, LDR) on growth, morphology, and oxidative stress in the liver and ovary of zebrafish for 5 weeks. Growth maintained relatively constant under LDB condition, but was reduced under LDR condition. In the liver, hepatosomatic index (HSI) and protein carbonylation (PC) increased under LDR condition, whereas lipid peroxidation (LPO) declined and HSI remained unchanged under LDB condition. The decrease in oxidative damage by LDB could be attributed to the up-regulated levels of mRNA, protein, and activity of Cu/Zn-SOD and CAT. A failure to activate the activity of both enzymes may result in the enhanced PC levels under LDR condition, though both genes were up-regulated at transcriptional and translational levels. In the ovary, although gonadosomatic index sharply increased under LDR condition, LPO and PC dramatically accumulated. The increase in oxidative damage by LDR might result from the down-regulated levels of protein and activity of Cu/Zn-SOD and CAT, though both genes were up-regulated at a transcriptional level. Furthermore, a sharp increase in expression of transcription factor Nrf2 that targets antioxidant genes was observed in the liver but not in the ovary under LDB and LDR conditions. In conclusion, our data demonstrated a positive effect of LDB and negative effect of LDR on fish antioxidant defenses, emphasizing the potentials of LDB as an effective light source in fish farming.

T1  - Changes in wintertime pH and hydrography of the Gulf of Finland (Baltic Sea) with focus on depth layers
AN  - 1875332040
AB  - We studied changes in sea water pH, temperature and salinity with focus on two depth layers, along the Gulf of Finland (the Baltic Sea) using long-term monitoring data from 1979 to 2015. Data from the most frequently sampled monitoring stations between western and eastern Gulf of Finland were used. The main result of the study reveals that pH has decreased both in surface and deep-water in the western Gulf of Finland with values ranging between -0.005 and -0.008 units year-1. We also demonstrate a rise in temperature (~2 °C) and decrease in salinity (~-0.7 g kg-1) at several stations over the last 36 years. In general, the changes are shown to be more pronounced in the western part of the gulf. This paper also stresses the importance of improving the sampling frequency and quality of monitoring measurements.

T1  - Use of low density polyethylene membranes for assessment of genotoxicity of PAHs in the Seine River
AN  - 1870191325
AB  - The genotoxicity of river water dissolved contaminants is usually estimated after grab sampling of river water. Water contamination can now be obtained with passive samplers that allow a time-integrated sampling of contaminants. Since it was verified that low density polyethylene membranes (LDPE) accumulate labile hydrophobic compounds, their use was proposed as a passive sampler. This study was designed to test the applicability of passive sampling for combined chemical and genotoxicity measurements. The LDPE extracts were tested with the umu test (TA1535/pSK1002±S9) and the Ames assay (TA98, TA100 and YG1041±S9). We describe here this new protocol and its application in two field studies on four sites of the Seine River. Field LDPE extracts were negative with the YG1041 and TA100 and weakly positive with the TA98+S9 and Umu test. Concentrations of labile mutagenic PAHs were higher upstream of Paris than downstream of Paris. Improvement of the method is needed to determine the genotoxicity of low concentrations of labile dissolved organic contaminants.

T1  - Seasonal distribution, sources and sink of dissolved organic carbon in integrated aquaculture system in coastal waters
AN  - 1865258871
AB  - Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were measured in the Sanggou Bay (SGB) in northern China, in order to investigate the seasonal distribution, sources and sink of DOC in an integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) system of fish, shellfish and seaweed. The sampling was conducted during April (spring), August (summer), October (autumn) and January (winter) of 2011-2012. Salinity, Chlorophyll a (Chl a) and DOC showed large spatial and seasonal variation during sampling period. DOC increased with increasing Chl a in spring, summer and autumn and decreased with increasing salinity in summer compared to other seasons. Maximum surface concentration of DOC ranged from 108.0 to 875.2 µM and minimum from 134.4 to 184.7 µM was found during summer and spring, respectively. Terrestrial input, phytoplankton and seaweed were the main sources of DOC in SGB. Shellfish farming area was enriched in organic matter as well as served to reduce DOC levels in the bay. As it was indicated that average annual removal of 42 % DOC occurred in the shellfish, the lowest occurred at an average 32 % in combined shellfish and seaweed culture area. Additionally, controlled experiment results showed that seaweed produced approximately 64.81 ± 40.86 µM day
-1 and shellfish generated approximately 13.36 ± 6.07 µM day-1 and assimilated 17.07 ± 13.12 µM day-1 DOC in SGB. Accumulation of DOC at the bottom could be a result of long-term aquaculture activities in the bay. Integration of sea cucumber into IMTA system could be useful to mitigate the stockpile of organic matter at the bottom.

T1  - A silver fibre prepared by a facile method for solid-phase microextraction of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
AN  - 2047022640
AB  - Abstract. The development of highly efficient fibres by a simple preparation method is still a research focus for solid-phase microextraction (SPME). A facile reaction was used to generate a silver coating on silver wire for SPME. The reaction of silver with hydrogen peroxide is very slow, but the formation of [Ag(NH3)2]+ by adding ammonia reduces the electrode potential and increases the reaction rate. The silver fibre was characterised by scanning electron microscopy. Using gas chromatography, the silver fibre was evaluated using polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as model analytes. Under optimised extraction conditions, an analysis method was established. A wide linear range (0.06-100??g?L?1) with a good linear coefficient (0.9896-0.9995) and a low detection limit (0.02-0.10??g?L?1) were achieved. The analysis method was used to analyse rainwater and lake water, and achieved a satisfactory recovery (86.3-119?%). The results indicate that the proposed silver fibre has practical applications in environmental analysis.

T1  - Expert Decision Support Technique for Algal Bloom Governance in Urban Lakes Based on Text Analysis
AN  - 1910586103
AB  - As a typical phenomenon of eutrophication pollution, algal bloom threatens public health and water security. The governance of algal bloom is largely affected by administrators’ knowledge and experience, which may lead to a subjective and one-sided decision-making result. Meanwhile, experts in the specific field can provide professional support. How to utilize expert resources adequately and automatically has been a problem. This paper proposes an expert decision support technique for algal bloom governance based on text analysis methods. Firstly, the decision support mechanism is introduced to form a general decision-making framework. Secondly, the expert classification method is proposed to help with choosing suitable experts. Thirdly, a multi-criteria group decision-making method is presented based on the automatic analysis of experts’ decision opinions. Finally, an experiment is conducted to verify the expert decision support technique. The results show the technique’s feasibility and rationality. This paper describes experts’ information and opinions with natural language, which can intuitively reflect the natural meaning. The expert decision support technique based on text analysis broadens the management thought of water pollution in urban lakes.

T1  - Toxic potential of different types of sewage sludge as fertiliser in agriculture: ecotoxicological effects on aquatic, sediment and soil indicator species
AN  - 1842826845
AB  - Purpose

              
Treated and processed sewage sludges (biosolids) generated during the treatment of wastewater usually contain substantial concentrations of nutrients, especially phosphorus, which is essential for plant growth. Sewage sludge therefore can be used as an alternative fertiliser in agriculture. But since sewage sludge could also contain pollutants, analysis and ecotoxicological tests on affected soil and stream water organisms are necessary in order to guarantee its harmless use.

              
Materials and methods

              
Three test species were chosen to cover the environmental compartments, water, sediment and soil. The following test species and parameters were applied to evaluate the acute effects of three sewage sludge samples: Lemna minor (growth inhibition, discolouration and colony breakup), Gammarus fossarum (mortality, behaviour) and Eisenia fetida (avoidance behaviour). Chemical assessment included nutrients, organic pollutants and heavy metals.

              
Results and discussion

              
The assessment of a non-dewatered sludge (S1) sample resulted in an inhibition of growth of L. minor starting from 0.6 g total solid (TS)l-1 after 7 days (EC50 1.2 g TS l-1). G. fossarum displayed significantly decreased movement activity at 0.5 and 1.2 g TS l-1 sludge concentration during an exposure time of 2 days, leading to decreased survival after 4 days of exposure in 0.5 g TS l-1 (LC50 0.5 g TS l-1). After 2 days, E. fetida exhibited an increased avoidance behaviour of contaminated soil from 0.2 g TS kg-1 sewage sludge (EC50 0.4 g TS kg-1). The dewatered sludge samples (S2 and S3) had a lower toxic effect on the test organisms. G. fossarum was the most sensitive test species in the applied test setups. The realistic application amounts of the tested sewage sludge samples of approximately 6.0 g TS kg-1 (maximum allowed application amount of sewage sludge) and approximately 3 g TS kg-1 (maximum agronomical relevant application amount) in worst case studies are higher than the analysed EC50/LC50 values of S1 and of the LC50 (G. fossarum) of S2 and S3.

              
Conclusions

              
All three tested sewage sludge samples have to be classified as toxic at high concentration levels under laboratory conditions. Realistic output quantities of S1 will negatively influence soil invertebrates and freshwater organisms (plants and crustacean), whereas the dewatered sludge samples will most likely not have any acute toxic effect on the test organisms in the field. Test with environmental samples should be conducted in order to support this hypothesis.

T1  - Impact of operational parameters on biofiltration performance: organic carbon removal and effluent turbidity
AN  - 1925616289
AB  - The objectives of this pilot-scale study were to optimize backwash frequency and empty bed contact time (EBCT) of biofilters treating ozonated surface water from Lake Ontario. Performance was benchmarked in terms of the reduction of turbidity, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), disinfection by-product (DBP) precursors, and ultrafiltration foulants (biopolymers). Increasing the EBCT from 4 to 8 min resulted in a higher reduction of DOC (5%), trihalomethane (THM4) and haloacetic acid (HAA9) precursors (∼12%) without negatively impacting effluent turbidity (consistently below 0.4 NTU), while biopolymer removal remained unaffected (2%). The impact of varying backwash frequency (5, 10, and 25 day intervals) was also compared for biofilters operated at an EBCT of 4 min. Results showed no impact of extended run times (up to 25 days) on DOC or DBP precursor removal; however turbidity removal was affected beyond 15 days of operation. Backwashing biofilters at 10 vs 5 day intervals would result in a reduction of backwash water, energy consumption and amount to nearly $17,000 in savings for the utility.

T1  - Matching Forces Applied in Underwater Hull Cleaning with Adhesion Strength of Marine Organisms
AN  - 1858321348
AB  - Biofouling is detrimental to the hydrodynamic performance of ships. In spite of advances in hull coating technology, a ship must usually undergo underwater hull cleaning to remove biofouling during her in-service time. However, some cleaning practices may also lead to decreased lifetime of the fouling-control coating. Therefore, cleaning forces should be minimized, according to the adhesion strength of marine organisms present on the hull. In this article, values of adhesion strength found in available literature are discussed in the light of current knowledge on hull cleaning technology. Finally, the following knowledge gaps are identified: (1) data on adhesion strength of naturally-occurring biofouling communities are practically absent; (2) shear forces imparted by current cleaning devices on low-form fouling (microfouling) and corresponding effects on hull coatings are largely unknown. This knowledge would be valuable for both developers and users of cleaning technology.

T1  - Screening of 17[alpha]-ethynylestradiol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pharmaceuticals accumulation in Mytilus edulis trossulus (Gould, 1890) collected from the Gulf of Gdansk
AN  - 1851003766
AB  - Pharmaceuticals are commonly found in water collected from wastewater treatment plants, fresh water and saline water. Their presence in water may result in constant accumulation in living organisms, and consequently a negative impact on those organisms. Abiotic samples collected from the Gulf of Gdansk were already proven to be polluted by several classes of pharmaceuticals, but the bioaccumulation was not investigated as far. This study presents the first results on the accumulation of pharmaceuticals in [Mytilus edulis trossulus] (Gould 1890) mussels collected from the Gulf of Gdansk. The content of target 6 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pharmaceuticals (ibuprofen, flurbiprofen, diclofenac, paracetamol, naproxen, ketoprofen) and 17α-ethynylestradiol in water and tissue samples was determined. The selected pharmaceuticals (paracetamol, flurbiprofen, 17α-ethynylestradiol) were found only in the largest individuals. The in situ BAFs calculated for paracetamol and flurbiprofen were 2850 and 16154 l kg[-1] (dry weight), respectively, suggesting a high potential for the bioaccumulation of these compounds. The synthetic hormone 17α-ethynylestradiol was also found in the collected mussels at the concentration of 310 ng g[-1] of dry weight. Generally, the examined mussels showed poor condition and it is highly likely that the accumulated pharmaceuticals are one of the important factors contributing to this.

T1  - Characteristic of Lower Don aquatic ecosystem in late autumn
AN  - 1865257944
AB  - Multidisciplinary studies were carried out in the Lower Don River in the low-water November of 2012. The studies showed relatively low concentrations of oil products (up to 2 MAC) and heavy metals (up to 1 MAC), which were likely due to the cessation of navigation in the river. However, copper concentration was found to be in excess of its MAC. The most polluted were found to be the port water areas of the cities of Volgodonsk, Ust'-Donetsk, and Semikarakorsk. The distribution of nutrients over streams is uneven: the Don water is poorer in nutrients than the waters of the Severskii Donets and the Manych are. Oxbows can serve as depots of organic matter, where it accumulates over longer periods than in the river. The residual manifestations of the summer-autumn blooming of blue-green algae, observed in shallows, the predominance of algae of divisions Cryptophyta and Bacillariophyta (typical representatives of winter planktonic algacenosis), and their low abundance suggest the transitional state of phytoplankton communities to autumn-winter season (pre-winter period). The species diversity and biomass of zooplankton were largest in the Don R. and lowest in the Severskii Donets R. The formation of zooplankton species composition shows the effect of the runoff from the Tsimlyanskoe Reservoir. An increase in the proportion of oligochaetes and invading species was recorded in the Don. The decrease in the diversity of benthos is attributed to natural factors, i.e., the decay of imago and thicket forms in autumn. The biomass of the soft (food) benthos is low because of the predominance of its small-size forms.

T1  - Chronic effects of triclosan on embryonic development of Chinese toad, Bufo gargarizans
AN  - 1830831577
AB  - Triclosan (TCS) is commonly used worldwide in a range of personal care and sanitizing products. The aim of this study was to evaluate potential effects of TCS exposure on embryonic development of Bufo gargarizans, an endemic frog species in China. Standard Gosner stage 3 B. gargarizans embryos were exposed to 10~150[mu]g/L TCS during embryogenesis. Survival, total length, weight, developmental stage, duration of different embryo stages, malformation, and type II and III deiodinase (D2 and D3) expression were measured. Inhibitory effects on embryo developmental stage, total length and weight were found at 30~150[mu]g/L TCS. Moreover, the duration of embryonic development was increased at gastrula, neural, circulation, and operculum development stage in TCS-treated groups. In addition, TCS exposure induced morphological malformations in B. gargarizans embryos, which are characterized by hyperplasia, abdominal edema, and axial flexures. Furthermore, our results showed that the expression of D2 in embryos was probably down-regulated at 60 and 150[mu]g/L TCS, but its spatial expression patterns was not affected by TCS. In summary, our study suggested that TCS exposure not only resulted in delayed growth and development but also caused teratogenic effects in B. gargarizans embryos, and the developmental effects of TCS at high concentrations may be associated with disruption of THs homeostasis. Although further studies are necessary, the present findings could provide a basis for understanding on harmful effects and the potential mechanisms of TCS in amphibian embryos.

T1  - Eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, valve gape behavior under diel-cycling hypoxia
AN  - 1824180087
AB  - Hypoxia and anoxia in many estuaries worldwide can cause a wide range of negative effects on animals that are directly exposed or indirectly influenced by food web interactions. Typically, experimental studies focus on animal behavior as a function of continuous exposure to low dissolved oxygen (DO) conditions rather than short-term fluctuations. Dissolved oxygen concentrations [DO] can, however, vary throughout the day, and water can become hypoxic for minutes to hours, often during the late night/early morning hours in the summer. Valve gape of 1-year-old eastern oysters, Crassostrea virginica, from Maryland, USA, was continuously measured while exposed to diel-cycling DO in aquaria during normoxic, hypoxic, and supersaturated phases of the cycle over several 2-day periods (July-August 2012). Severe hypoxia (0.6 mg DO L-1) induced oysters to close for significantly longer times than normoxic (7.3 mg DO L-1) conditions. Oysters exposed to mild hypoxia (1.7 mg DO L-1) closed for a similar amount of time as oysters held at normoxia and severe hypoxia. At severe hypoxia, more than one-third of the oysters closed simultaneously and closed immediately when they encountered severe hypoxia while oysters at mild hypoxia often closed later in the low oxygen phase of the cycles. When normoxia was reintroduced after severe hypoxia, most oysters opened immediately and gaped throughout the period. The results indicate that while 1-year-old oysters responded negatively to diel-cycling low [DO], especially to severe hypoxia, they rapidly opened during the normoxic period that followed, potentially reducing any negative effects of a fluctuating environment.

T1  - Histopathological effects following short-term coexposure of Cyprinus carpio to nanoparticles of TiO2 and CuO
AN  - 1821096995
AB  - The aim of this research was to investigate the coexposure of nanoparticles of titanium dioxide (TiO2) and copper oxide (CuO) on the alterations of the gill, intestine, kidney, and liver tissues of carps (Cyprinus carpio). In this study, carps (length 23 ± 1.5 cm; weight 13 ± 1.3 g) were divided into six groups of 15 each and exposed to 2.5 and 5.0 mg L-1 of CuO nanoparticles (NPs), 10.0 mg L-1 of TiO2 NPs, and 2.5 and 5.0 mg L-1 of CuO NPs + 10.0 mg L-1 of TiO2 NP mixture. Fish were sampled for histopathological studies after hematoxylin-eosin staining. Results indicated that the more kinds of histopathology anomalies observed with CuO NP and TiO2 NP mixture were broadly of the same type as CuO NPs and TiO2 NPs alone, but the severity or incidence of injuries of gill, intestine, liver, and kidney of carps in the mixture of CuO NPs + TiO2 NPs was higher than that of each NP alone. Moreover, behavioral changes in carps exposed to CuO NP and TiO2 NP mixture such as hyperactivity, loss of balance, and convulsions were higher than those to CuO NPs and TiO2 NPs alone. In conclusion, the presence of TiO2 NPs enhanced the effects of NPs of copper oxide in terms of histopathological changes in carps.

T1  - Oxidative stress induced in Hyalella azteca by an effluent from a NSAID-manufacturing plant in Mexico
AN  - 1867928995
AB  - Production in the pharmaceutical industry has increased and along with it, the amount of wastewater of various characteristics and contaminant concentrations. The main chemicals in these effluents are solvents, detergents, disinfectants--such as sodium hypochlorite (NaClO)--and pharmaceutical products, all of which are potentially ecotoxic. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the oxidative stress induced in the amphipod Hyalella azteca by the effluent from a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-manufacturing plant. The median lethal concentration (72 h-LC
50) was determined and H. azteca were exposed to the lowest observed adverse effect level (0.0732 %) for 12, 24, 48 and 72 h, and biomarkers of oxidative stress were evaluated [hydroperoxide content (HPC), lipid peroxidation (LPX), protein carbonyl content (PCC), and the activity of the superoxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx)]. Statistically significant increases with respect to the control group (P < 0.05) were observed in HPC, LPX and PCC in H. azteca at all exposure times. Antioxidant enzymes activity SOD, CAT and GPx activity also increased significantly (P < 0.05) with respect to the control group. In conclusion, the industrial effluent analyzed in the present study contains NSAIDs and NaClO, and induces oxidative stress in H. azteca.

T1  - Fine-scale spatial variation in ice cover and surface temperature trends across the surface of the Laurentian Great Lakes
AN  - 1813114676
AB  - Issue Title: Climatic Change Letters | Edited by Michael Oppenheimer | pages 353-360              The effects of climate change on north temperate freshwater ecosystems include increasing water temperatures and decreasing ice cover. Here we compare those trends in the Laurentian Great Lakes at three spatial scales to evaluate how warming varies across the surface of these massive inland water bodies. We compiled seasonal ice cover duration (1973-2013) and lake summer surface water temperatures (LSSWT; 1994-2013), and analyzed spatial patterns and trends at lake-wide, lake sub-basin, and fine spatial scales and compared those to reported lake- and basin-wide trends. At the lake-wide scale we found declining ice duration and warming LSSWT patterns consistent with previous studies. At the lake sub-basin scale, our statistical models identified distinct warming trends within each lake that included significant breakpoints in ice duration for 13 sub-basins, consistent linear declines in 11 sub-basins, and no trends in 4 sub-basins. At the finest scale, we found that the northern- and eastern-most portions of each Great Lake, especially in nearshore areas, have experienced faster rates of LSSWT warming and shortening ice duration than those previously reported from trends at the lake scale. We conclude that lake-level analyses mask significant spatial and temporal variation in warming patterns within the Laurentian Great Lakes. Recognizing spatial variability in rates of change can inform both mechanistic modeling of ecosystem responses and planning for long-term management of these large freshwater ecosystems.

T1  - Effects of endocrine disruptors on reproduction in viviparous teleosts with intraluminal gestation
AN  - 1811151941
AB  - Many water systems worldwide are affected by pollutants, including potential endocrine disruptors (EDs). Most studies on the effects of EDs on fish reproduction have focused on oviparous species. However, some important groups of fishes are not oviparous and there is scarce information about how EDs affect species with alternative reproductive modes. Goodeinae is a viviparous matrotrophic subfamily with intraluminal gestation (IG), where transfer of nutrients occurs and embryos develop inside the ovarian cavity. Goodeinae is endemic to the Mexican Central Plateau, an area affected by potential EDs, including 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). This review synthesizes the available information about EDs in viviparous teleosts with IG and performs a case study on the effects of 2,4-D on gonadal structure of two Goodeinae species. We hypothesized that individuals exposed to 2,4-D might show altered gonadal structure. The available information included effects on gene expression, sexual differentiation, gametogenesis, secondary sexual characteristics, and sexual behavior. Knowledge gaps persisted on the effects of EDs on viviparous teleosts with IG. Holistic approaches are needed to understand the mechanisms underlying endocrine disruption effects. Field studies are needed to evaluate the consequences of EDs on wild populations. The case study revealed histological alterations in oocytes, spermatogonia, and sperm cysts in fishes exposed to 2,4-D. Ultrastructurally, gonads exhibited alterations in oocyte mitochondrial and nuclear membranes, and in spermatid mitochondria. The observed changes could be related to 2,4-D exposure, which may affect species reproduction in their natural environment. Matrotrophic viviparous teleosts with IG may serve as models to explore endocrine disruption.

T1  - Transcriptome Sequencing and Comparative Analysis of Ovary and Testis Identifies Potential Key Sex-Related Genes and Pathways in Scallop Patinopecten yessoensis
AN  - 1926872070
AB  - Bivalve mollusks have fascinatingly diverse modes of reproduction. However, research investigating sex determination and reproductive regulation in this group of animals is still in its infancy. In this study, transcriptomes of three ovaries and three testes of Yesso scallop were sequenced and analyzed. Transcriptome comparison revealed that 4394 genes were significantly different between ovaries and testes, of which 1973 were ovary-biased (upregulated in the ovaries) and 2421 were testis-biased. Crucial sex-determining genes that were previously reported in vertebrates and putatively present in bivalves, namely FOXL2, DMRT, SOXH, and SOXE, were investigated. The genes all possessed conserved functional domains and were detected in the gonads. Except for PySOXE, the other three genes were significantly differentially expressed between the ovaries and testes. PyFOXL2 was ovary-biased, and PyDMRT and PySOXH were testis-biased, suggesting that these three genes are likely to be key candidates for scallop sex determination/differentiation. Furthermore, GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were conducted for both ovary- and testis-biased genes. Interestingly, both neurotransmitter transporters and GABAergic synapse genes were overrepresented in the ovary-biased genes, suggesting that neurotransmitters, such as GABA and glycine, are likely to participate in scallop ovary development. Our study will assist in better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying bivalve sex determination and reproductive regulation.

T1  - Tracing the Seepage of Subsurface Sinkhole Vent Waters into Lake Huron Using Radium and Stable Isotopes of Oxygen and Hydrogen
AN  - 1811157725
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue on Coastal Chemical Oceanography: A tribute to Thomas M. Church

              
Exchange of water between groundwater and surface water could alter water quality of the surface waters and thereby impact its ecosystem. Discharges of anoxic groundwater, with high concentrations of sulfate and chloride and low concentrations of nitrate and oxygen, from three sinkhole vents (El Cajon, Middle Island and Isolated) in Lake Huron have been recently documented. In this investigation, we collected and analyzed a suite of water samples from these three sinkhole vents and lake water samples from Lake Huron for Ra, radon-222, stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen, and other ancillary parameters. These measurements are among the first of their kind in this unique environment. The activities of Ra are found to be one to two orders of magnitude higher than that of the lake water. Isotopic signatures of some of the bottom lake water samples indicate evidences for micro-seeps at distances farther from these three vents. A plot of δD versus δ18O indicates that there are deviations from the Global Meteoric Line that can be attributed to mixing of different water masses and/or due to some subsurface chemical reactions. Using the Ra isotopic ratios, we estimated the transit times of the vent waters from the bottom to the top of the vent (i.e., sediment-water interface) to be 4-37 days. More systematic studies on the distribution of the radioactive and stable isotope studies are needed to evaluate the prevalence of micro-seeps in Lake Huron and other Great Lakes system.

T1  - Sediment-water interaction in phosphorus cycling as affected by trophic states in a Chinese shallow lake (Lake Donghu)
AN  - 1796433190
AB  - Lake sediment substantially accumulates nutrients, while little is known regarding the conditions under which it tends to be a sink or source of phosphorus. It is postulated that the above functions were largely dependent on trophic state. To test this hypothesis, composition, abundance, and size-spectrum of phytoplankton were studied in a Chinese shallow lake (Lake Donghu), together with concentrations and sorption behaviors of phosphorus in water column and sediment. Relationships among these variables were also examined by structural equation model. In the basins with the lowest phosphorus concentration, sediment was a phosphorus source as judged by equilibrium phosphorus concentration, directly affecting the abundance of phytoplankton with smaller size. Contrastingly, in the basins with the highest phosphorus concentration, sediment tended to uptake phosphorus, companied by the lowest ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus, diversity, and evenness of phytoplankton with the smaller size one dominating. Oscillatoria sp. was directly affected by ammonia and phosphorus. Moreover, with a balanced exchange of phosphorus between sediment and water column, phytoplankton increased markedly with the highest diversity and evenness in the basins having intermediate phosphorus concentration. Overall, trophic state modulated sediment functions to supply nutrient and was in turn greatly affected by the sediment in shallow lakes.

T1  - Functional Morphology of the Feeding Apparatus in Simenchelys parasitica (Simenchelyinae: Synaphobranchidae), an Alleged Parasitic Eel
AN  - 1852711474
AB  - The Pugnose Eel, Simenchelys parasitica (family Synaphobranchidae, subfamily Simenchelyinae), is a deep-water species described as both being a parasite and a scavenger that can bite off large chunks of flesh. Little, however, is known about its cranial morphology, including to what degree its feeding apparatus is modified to allow feeding specializations. We provide a detailed description of the cranial morphology of 5. parasitica, comparing it with that of more closely related synaphobranchid species, for which no parasitic behavior has been reported, i.e., Ilyophis brunneus (Ilyophinae) and Synaphobranchus brevidorsalis (Synaphobranchinae). Pugnose Eels have stretchable skin around a small, terminal mouth, as well as teeth with a clear cutting edge, a mouth-closing apparatus equipped with large jaw muscles, a large tongue-like secretory structure, and well-developed hyoid and branchial arches to facilitate the transport of large food items in the buccal cavity. A comparison with other species provides several lines of evidence supporting the hypothesis that Pugnose Eels have a feeding apparatus that is equipped for biting off chunks of flesh from prey (Irrespective of whether prey is dead or alive), most likely by using rotational feeding.

T1  - Physiological Constraints in Juvenile Ostrea chilensis Fed the Toxic Dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella
AN  - 1794089284
AB  - Frequent blooms of the dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella in southern Chile encouraged undertaking the present study which uses the oyster Ostrea chilensis as a model for evaluating the feeding, growth, lipid storage and mortality responses to diets containing paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) produced by A. catenella. Medium-term (30 days) physiological responses of two groups of juvenile oysters were measured every 10 days. Five replicates were exposed to diets containing A. catenella and other five replicates were fed with a diet containing the non-toxic algae Isochrysis galbana. Diets were continuously supplied at a concentration of 2 mg L-1, in which the feeding and metabolic activity was measured, and the scope for growth calculated. Lipids storage, actual growth and mortality were also measured every 10 days. The results showed that the toxic diet has dramatic negative effects on feeding and metabolism of the juvenile individuals of O. chilensis, with high reduction of the lipid storage and growth. Mortality was also increased in individuals fed with the contaminated diet. This study supports the conclusion that the toxic dinoflagellate A. catenella restricts the energy acquisition in the juvenile O. chilensis, an important fishery and aquaculture resource in southern Chile.

T1  - Estimating the DNA strand breakage using a fuzzy inference system and agarose gel electrophoresis, a case study with toothed carp Aphanius sophiae exposed to cypermethrin
AN  - 1790884768
AB  - The DNA breakage has been widely used in ecotoxicological studies to investigate effects of pesticides in fishes. The present study used a fuzzy inference system to quantify the breakage of DNA double strand in Aphanius sophiae exposed to the cypermethrin. The specimens were adapted to different temperatures and salinity for 14 days and then exposed to cypermethrin. DNA of each specimens were extracted, electrophoresed and photographed. A fuzzy system with three input variables and 27 rules were defined. The pixel value curve of DNA on each gel lane was obtained using ImageJ. The DNA breakage was quantified using the pixel value curve and fuzzy system. The defuzzified values were analyzed using a three-way analysis of variance. Cypermethrin had significant effects on DNA breakage. Fuzzy inference systems can be used as a tool to quantify the breakage of double strand DNA. DNA double strand of the gill of A. sophiae is sensitive enough to be used to detect cypermethrin in surface waters in concentrations much lower than those reported in previous studies.

T1  - Assessing Ecological Status of Transitional and Coastal Waters; Current Difficulties and Alternative Approaches
AN  - 2307425792
AB  - The environmental monitoring strategy termed ecosystem-based approach (EBA) underlines the obvious benefits of managing natural resources on a holistic level, and it is particularly invoked for the rational and sustainable management of aquatic resources. However, when coming to implement EBA into monitoring schemes, such as those derived from the implementation of the European legislation concerning water quality, difficulties inherent to the complex and dynamic nature of ecosystems arise, including (i) identify appropriate, relevant and easily measurable indicators of ecosystem integrity, and (ii) combine the heterogeneous information gathered at the different levels of organization included in an ecosystem into a simple and practical decision-making scheme. The first kind of difficulties maybe partially overcome by implementing monitoring schemes which take into account the hierarchical nature of ecosystem processes and did not neglect the use of indicators at low levels of biological organization, including ecotoxicological biomarkers and bioassays. Secondly, the integration of the monitoring results into a practical decision-making scheme can best be achieved by using non metric multivariate analysis, which is especially suitable for data bases including different metrics, and allows the processing of variables showing non-monotonic response to human stress, from molecular biomarkers to community indices. The difficulties inherent to the current rigid scheme of water quality assessment heavily based on ratio-to-reference univariate indicators and arbitrary reference values and class boundaries for each single indicator are illustrated with a case study in the Minho estuary (NW Iberian Peninsula). The classification of aquatic ecosystems into discrete categories of ecological status can best be achieved by combining observations at different levels of biological organization, from molecular biomarkers to community traits, with explicative physicochemical and hydromorphological elements, and by using non-metric multivariate analysis techniques.

T1  - Long-term effects of di-octyl phthalate on the expression of immune-related genes in Tegillarca granosa
AN  - 1787035919
AB  - Di-octyl phthalate (DOP) is widely used as a plasticizer in the plastics industry. As a result, DOP is often found in marine water ecosystems where many species are exposed to it. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of long-term (14 d) DOP exposure (2.6, 7.8, or 31.2 mg/L) on the expression of immunerelated genes in Tegillarca granosa. The expression of small heat shock protein (sHSPs) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP) were highest in clams exposed to 31.2 mg/L DOP on days 7 and 14. The relative expression of Tg-ferritin, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and metallothionein (MT) increased initially then decreased as the concentration of DOP increased. The hemoglobin of T. granosa (Tg-HbI) exhibited two distinct expression patterns at two time points. Our results suggest that the immune response of T. granosa against DOP pollution varies depending on the dose. Additionally, we identified some immune-related genes that are promising candidates for biomarkers of DOP.

T1  - The Comparison of [delta]^sup 13^C Values of a Deposit- and a Suspension-Feeder Bio-Indicates Benthic vs. Pelagic Couplings and Trophic Status in Contrasted Coastal Ecosystems
AN  - 1776785600
AB  - δ^sup 13^C and δ^sup 15^N values of two generalists primary consumers, a strict deposit-feeder polychaete (Arenicola marina), and a strict suspension-feeder bivalve (Crassostrea gigas), were investigated to typify the trophic functioning of two contrasted marine coastal ecosystems (eutrophic and mesotrophic, east and west Cotentin peninsula, respectively, English Channel, Normandy, France). On average, δ^sup 13^C and δ^sup 15^N values of lugworms mirrored those of sediment organic matter (SOM), whereas δ^sup 13^C and δ^sup 15^N of oysters mirrored those of suspended particulate organic matter (SPOM). δ^sup 13^C values of the two species displayed significant differences on the west coast (mesotrophic) contrary to the east coast (eutrophic; significant interactions). δ^sup 15^N values differed only between sites and not between species. Diet of A. marina relied exclusively on microphytobenthos (MPB) and detritus of macroalgae (ULV) on the mesotrophic coast, whereas diet of C. gigas relied mainly on SPOM. Conversely, on the eutrophic ecosystem (the east coast), both species displayed the same diet, which was a mixture of pelagic sources (SPOM), benthic sources (MPB and ULV) and to a lesser extent riverine particulate organic matter (rPOM). These results were explained by the intensity of benthic vs. pelagic couplings (i.e. benthic-pelagic and pelagic-benthic) which differed in the two ecosystems. Low trophic coupling occurred on the mesotrophic (west) coast, whereas benthic-pelagic (SOM resuspension) and pelagic-benthic (settling of SPOM such as phytoplankton blooms) couplings were typified on the eutrophic (east) coast. This higher particulate organic matter (POM) pelagic-benthic coupling on the east coast was probably enhanced by nutrient enrichment caused by eutrophication. Comparison of δ^sup 13^C ratios of both the strict deposit-feeder (e.g. A. marina) and the strict suspension-feeder (e.g. C. gigas) was then proposed as a bio-indicator of the trophic status and of POM benthic vs. pelagic couplings of soft-bottom coastal ecosystems.

T1  - Aeshnid dragonfly larvae as bioindicators of methylmercury contamination in aquatic systems impacted by elevated sulfate loading
AN  - 1771233229
AB  - Methylmercury (MeHg) levels in dragonfly larvae and water were measured over two years in aquatic systems impacted to varying degrees by sulfate releases related to iron mining activity. This study examined the impact of elevated sulfate loads on MeHg concentrations and tested the use of MeHg in dragonfly larvae as an indicator of MeHg levels in a range of aquatic systems including 16 river/stream sites and two lakes. MeHg concentrations in aeshnid dragonfly larvae were positively correlated (R ^sup 2^ = 0.46, p < 0.01) to peak MeHg concentrations in the dissolved phase for the combined years of 2012 and 2013. This relation was strong in 2012 (R ^sup 2^ = 0.85, p < 0.01), but showed no correlation in 2013 (R ^sup 2^ = 0.02, p > 0.05). MeHg in dragonfly larvae were not elevated at the highest sulfate sites, but rather the reverse was generally observed. Record rainfall events in 2012 and above average rainfall in 2013 likely delivered the majority of Hg and MeHg to these systems via interflow and activated groundwater flow through reduced sediments. As a result, the impacts of elevated sulfate releases due to mining activities were not apparent in these systems where little of the sulfate is reduced. Lower bioaccumulation factors for MeHg in aeshnid dragonfly larvae were observed with increasing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations. This finding is consistent with previous studies showing that MeHg in high DOC systems is less bioavailable; an equilibrium model shows that more MeHg being associated with DOC rather than algae at the base of the food chain readily explains the lower bioaccumulation factors.

T1  - Measuring cytochrome P450 activity in aquatic invertebrates: a critical evaluation of in vitro and in vivo methods
AN  - 1764950645
AB  - The first step in xenobiotic detoxification in aquatic invertebrates is mainly governed by the cytochrome P450 mixed function oxidase system. The ability to measure cytochrome P450 activity provides an important tool to understand macroinvertebrates' responses to chemical stressors. However, measurements of P450 activity in small aquatic invertebrates have had variable success and a well characterized assay is not yet available. The general lack of success has been scarcely investigated and it is therefore the focus of the present work. In particular, the suitability of the substrate selected for the assay, the sensitivity of the assay and the possible inhibition/attenuation of enzymatic activity caused by endogenous substances were investigated. 7-ethoxycoumarin-O-dealkylation activity of Daphnia magna, Chironomus riparius larvae and Hyalella azteca was assessed in vivo and in vitro and possible inhibition of enzymatic activity by macroinvertebrates homogenate was investigated. Activities of D. magna and C. riparius larvae measured in vivo were 1.37 ± 0.08 and 2.2 ± 0.2 pmol h^sup -1^ organism^sup -1^, respectively, while activity of H. azteca could not be detected. In vitro activity could be measured in C. riparius larvae only (500-1000 pmol h^sup -1^ mg microsomal protein^sup -1^). The optimization of the in vitro assay has been especially long and resource consuming and particularly for D. magna, substances that inhibited cytochrome P450 activity seemed to be released during tissue homogenization preventing activity measurements in vitro. We therefore recommend testing the P450 inhibition potential of homogenate preparations prior to any investigation of P450 activity in vitro in macroinvertebrates.

T1  - Application of Wastewater and Biosolids in Soil: Occurrence and Fate of Emerging Contaminants
AN  - 1764080083
AB  - Wastewater (WW) for irrigation and application of biosolids in soil is becoming important as it is going to become very common in the near future. By 2050, the world is going to have four billion people living in water-scarce countries, making it a norm of freshwater for the cities and WW for agriculture. Further, biosolids might still be used as green biofertilizers for soils, if they are improved from an ecological point of view. However, application of biosolids in soil is argued because of the amount of organic pollutants that compromise the dynamic equilibrium of the biological systems. Therefore, information on the concentration, behavior, and cycling of organic pollutants as well as their possible degradation pathways is needed to predict, prevent, and remediate these pollutants from different sources including WW and biosolids. Among the group of organic pollutants, emerging contaminants (ECs) enter into the soil with the irrigation water from treated effluents and fertilization by biosolids. Quantification of ECs from WW and biosolids is of main importance to predict the toxic effects of WW effluents and sludge. Moreover, their incorporation into vegetables through irrigation and their magnification through natural food webs have been proved and must be monitored. This review presents information on the different sources of emerging contaminants and linking with the ecological effects they produced by reacting in the environment during various applications of WW and biosolids in soil. The available methods for analysis and quantification of ECs in different matrices, such as WW and biosolids, are also presented.

T1  - Metals bioaccumulation in two edible bivalves and health risk assessment
AN  - 1762628588
AB  - Our aim was to quantify the bioaccumulation of 13 metals in two edible bivalves (Ruditapes decussatus and Paphia undulata) in Lake Timsah, Egypt. A potential human health risk assessment was conducted to evaluate the hazards from bivalve consumption. Fe, Al, Zn, and Sr had the highest concentrations in the bivalve samples. The levels of Cd were much lower than the maximum permissible level, while Pb concentrations in the two bivalves were nearly two times the permissible level. The extent of bioaccumulation factor was site- and species-specific. For low and high bivalve-consuming groups, the estimated daily intake of Pb and Cd ranged from 0.01 to 0.76 [mu]g/kg/day. For low and high bivalve-consuming groups, hazard quotients (HQs) for metals were found to be less than 1 for both bivalve species, except for Co in the high-consuming group. In conclusion, even though there was no apparent risk to bivalve consumers from being exposed to single metals, there is a risk from being exposed to the 13 studied metals together, especially for high bivalve-consuming groups such as fishermen.

T1  - Discrepancies between the stable isotope compositions of water, macrophyte carbonates and organics, and mollusc shells in the littoral zone of a charophyte-dominated lake (Lake Lednica, Poland)
AN  - 1761208123
AB  - The aim of this study was to better understand the relations between carbon and oxygen stable isotope values of ambient water, mollusc shells, macrophytes and their carbonate encrustations, commonly used in palaeolimnological studies. Water, molluscs and macrophytes were sampled from the littoral zone in Lake Lednica, NW Poland. The influence of carbon species assimilated during photosynthesis and the net intensity of photosynthesis resulting from the size of charophyte species and the density of their stands were postulated to be the most important factors causing the species-specific δ^sup 13^C values of charophyte thalli and encrustations. It was suggested that photosynthetic activity of charophytes affected not only the δ^sup 13^C values of charophyte encrustations but also mollusc shells by changing δ^sup 13^C values of DIC within charophyte stands. In addition, incorporation of metabolic carbon into the shell was proposed as the main cause of both the ^sup 13^C depletion of mollusc shells relative to δ^sup 13^C values of DIC and the species-specific δ^sup 13^C values of shells. Mollusc shells were precipitated at the isotope equilibrium or close to the equilibrium with δ^sup 18^O values of lake water. Charophyte encrustations were found to be ^sup 18^O depleted due to the kinetic isotope effects during intense photosynthesis and thus fast precipitation of the calcite.

In the present study, we examined the mechanisms responsible for the horizontal distribution of these blooms in the main body of Poyang Lake. Specifically, we addressed the hypothesis that colonies of cyanobacteria are first generated in the Eastern Bay (EB, lentic region) and then advected offshore by large-scale horizontal transport processes, with the colonies subsequently found in Northern Poyang Lake (NPL, lotic region). The cyanobacteria biomass in the EB was significantly greater than that in NPL (P < 0.0001), and negative correlations were observed between cyanobacteria biomass and nutrient concentrations in the EB. However, significant correlations were not observed between cyanobacteria biomass and nutrient concentrations in NPL. The peak abundance of cyanobacteria was first observed in the EB, with the cyanobacterial abundance peak in NPL lagging the EB peak by approximately 1 month. These results are all consistent with the cyanobacteria distribution hypothesis and show the potential for the accumulation of cyanobacteria in NPL that are normally considered unsuitable for in situ growth in EB. Variations of cyanobacteria biomass in eutrophic lakes, including Yangtze-connected (Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake) and Yangtze-isolated (Taihu) lakes, were monitored during summer (July-August), and eutrophic or even polytrophic conditions were not observed to support the development of cyanobacteria. Instead, a high rate of water flow with short retention times was the key factor preventing the accumulation of cyanobacteria in these eutrophic lakes. Therefore, the mean cyanobacteria biomass was significantly lower in the Yangtze-connected lakes (Poyang Lake, 1.01 mg l^sup -1^; Dongting Lake, 1.71 mg l^sup -1^) than in Taihu Lake at Meiliang Bay (13.54 mg l^sup -1^) or the mouth (3.45 mg l^sup -1^) (P < 0.0001); however, the biomass more closely resembled Taihu Lake at the center (0.88 mg l^sup -1^). As expected, the cyanobacteria biomass was lower in the lakes with hydraulic connections to the Yangtze River compared with those isolated from the Yangtze River. This study revealed that hydrological parameters dominated the accumulation of cyanobacterial blooms in the Yangtze-connected eutrophic lakes in eastern China.

T1  - Marine harmful algal blooms, human health and wellbeing: challenges and opportunities in the 21st century
AN  - 1769590557
AB  - Microalgal blooms are a natural part of the seasonal cycle of photosynthetic organisms in marine ecosystems. They are key components of the structure and dynamics of the oceans and thus sustain the benefits that humans obtain from these aquatic environments. However, some microalgal blooms can cause harm to humans and other organisms. These harmful algal blooms (HABs) have direct impacts on human health and negative influences on human wellbeing, mainly through their consequences to coastal ecosystem services (fisheries, tourism and recreation) and other marine organisms and environments. HABs are natural phenomena, but these events can be favoured by anthropogenic pressures in coastal areas. Global warming and associated changes in the oceans could affect HAB occurrences and toxicity as well, although forecasting the possible trends is still speculative and requires intensive multidisciplinary research. At the beginning of the 21st century, with expanding human populations, particularly in coastal and developing countries, mitigating HABs impacts on human health and wellbeing is becoming a more pressing public health need. The available tools to address this global challenge include maintaining intensive, multidisciplinary and collaborative scientific research, and strengthening the coordination with stakeholders, policymakers and the general public. Here we provide an overview of different aspects of the HABs phenomena, an important element of the intrinsic links between oceans and human health and wellbeing.

T1  - Alteration of cytochrome P450 1 regulation and HSP 70 level in brain of juvenile common carp (Cyprinus carpio) after chronic exposure to tributyltin
AN  - 1762346688
AB  - Tributyltin (TBT), a toxic contaminant in aquatic environments, has bio-accumulated in aquatic food webs throughout the world and can be found at toxic levels in some biota. However, the molecular mechanisms and effects of TBT are not fully understood. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of long-term exposure of TBT on cytochrome P450 (CYP450) 1 regulation and heat-shock proteins (HSPs) profiling in brain of freshwater teleost. The effects of long-term exposure to TBT on mRNA expression of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) 1 family genes and ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity in the brain of common carp were evaluated, as well as HSP 70 level. Fish were exposed to sublethal concentrations of TBT (75 ng/L, 0.75 [mu]g/L and 7.5 [mu]g/L) for 15, 30, and 60 days. Based on the results, long-term exposure (more than 15 days) to TBT could lead to obvious physiological-biochemical responses (based on EROD activity, HSP 70 level and CYP450 1 family genes expression). The mRNA expression of CYP450 1 family genes (CYP1A, CYP1B, CYP1C1 and CYP1C2) suggested that CYP1A was to accommodate most EROD activity in fish, but other CYP450 forms also involved in this proceeding. Thus, the measured physiological responses in fish brain could provide useful information to better understand the mechanisms of TBT-induced bio-toxicity and could be used as potential biomarkers for monitoring the TBT pollution in the field.

T1  - Is gamete morphology involved in hybridization in oysters?
AN  - 1757873493
AB  - Some pairs of oyster species in the genus Crassostrea can produce viable hybrids, and heterospecific fertilization may be symmetric, asymmetric, or very low. For example, with C. angulata and C. gigas, fertilization is equally successful whether the mature oocytes come from the first or the second species. Fertilization is asymmetric between C. ariakensis and C. virginica, i.e., it is higher when C. ariakensis is the source of the oocytes. Fertilization success is low between C. ariakensis and C. gigas. These differences probably relate chiefly to molecular mechanisms of gamete recognition, but the present study examines whether the size and certain aspects of gamete morphology may also play a role. Individuals of four species of the genus Crassostrea (Ostreidae: Bivalvia), collected from different geographic regions between 2006 and 2011, C. angulata (Penghu Island, Taiwan Strait), C. ariakensis (Nha Trang Bay, South China Sea), C. gigas (Peter the Great Bay, Sea of Japan), and C. virginica (Galveston Bay, Gulf of Mexico), were examined for conspecific relationships between the thickness of the vitelline envelope in mature oocytes and the size of the acrosome or subacrosomal spaces in spermatozoa. Thicker vitelline envelopes corresponded with bigger acrosomes and subacrosomal spaces in three of the four species. The exception was C. gigas, which has the thickest vitelline envelope, but the lytic compartments in its spermatozoa are not the largest. Moreover, sizes of acrosome, subacrosomal space, and vitelline envelope are similar between the species with symmetric heterospecific fertilization, while difference in sizes of these structures increases the possibility of asymmetric cross-fertilization or decreased fertilization rate.

T1  - Human exposure to methylmercury from crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) in China
AN  - 1757864959
AB  - Methylmercury (MeHg) accumulation in aquatic food raises global concerns about human exposure to MeHg. Crayfish is the world's third largest farmed crustacean species and a favorite aquatic food in many countries. However, human health hazard due to MeHg exposure via crayfish consumption is unclear, partly because appropriate survey data are lacking. We report on mercury concentrations and speciation in edible tail muscle of crayfish collected from restaurants in 23 Chinese cities. On average, MeHg constituted 99.1 % of mercury in tail muscle, and MeHg concentrations were comparable with those reported for fish in China. Variation in MeHg concentrations was not attributable to broad geographic region (i.e., provinces) or tail length. For different populations, potential health risk (characterized by hazard quotient or HQ) of MeHg exposure through crayfish consumption depended largely on crayfish consumption rates. In particular, a health hazard (HQ > 1) was found for high-rate consumers (i.e., 95 %ile or higher) in some cities in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River (MLYR), during the peak consumption season. Our results suggest that more attention should be paid to dietary MeHg intake via crayfish consumption in China, particularly for communities with high consumption in MLYR.

T1  - Inter- and intraspecific variation of carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios in freshwater bivalves
AN  - 1749553851
AB  - Freshwater bivalves provide important ecosystem functions and services, yet many of their ecological traits such as feeding mechanisms and resource use are largely ignored. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the potential overlap in resource use by bivalve species living in sympatry in European freshwater ecosystems. This was accomplished by analyzing the stable isotope ratios of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) values of six bivalve species (five native species plus the invasive species Corbicula fluminea) in six distinct aquatic ecosystems. Results showed significant inter- and intraspecific differences in both stable isotope ratios. The interspecific variability suggests differences in the food sources consumed, which can be related to differences in feeding behavior. At the intraspecific level, there was a gradient in the stable isotope ratios from the oligotrophic River Paiva (^sup 15^N-depleted and ^sup 13^C-enriched) to the eutrophic Mira Lagoon (^sup 15^N-enriched and ^sup 13^C-depleted), suggesting a change in the resources used from benthic to pelagic food sources, respectively, and/or differences in the stable isotopic baseline in each ecosystem. Thus, flexible feeding strategies combined with size selectivity may decrease the possible competition for food sources by native and invasive species living in sympatry.

T1  - EFFICACY OF TWO LARVASONIC(TM) UNITS AGAINST CULEX LARVAE AND EFFECTS ON COMMON AQUATIC NONTARGET ORGANISMS IN HARRIS COUNTY, TEXAS 1
AN  - 1789291933
AB  - The Larvasonic(TM) Field Arm Mobile Wetlands Unit and SD-Mini were tested for efficacy against Culex larvae, and effects on aquatic nontarget organisms (NTO). The Field Arm provided 84.61% to 100% control of caged Culex larvae out to 0.91-m distance in shallow ditches and 60.45% control of Culex larvae at 0.61-m without any effects to caged NTO. Slow ditch treatment achieved 77.35% control compared to fast treatment (20.42%), whereas 77.65% control was obtained along edges of a neglected swimming pool, compared to near the middle (23.97%). In bucket tests, the SD-Mini provided .97% control of Culex and 85.35% reduction of immature giant water bugs, which decreased slightly (83.45%) over the monitoring period, which was not significantly different from cannibalistic damselflies (62.80%), with reduction of both being significantly higher than other NTO tested. There was a small (0.37%) reduction of dragonflies (naiads), due to cannibalism. Both Larvasonic units could effectively augment conventional larvicide operations in smaller areas without causing resistance within mosquito populations or harming NTO when used properly.

AN  - 1728124095
AB  - This study aimed to: (1) investigate intra-sample variability in the stable isotope composition (δ^sup 13^C and δ^sup 18^O values) measured in several individual mollusc shells; and (2) determine the optimum number of individual mollusc shells required to obtain stable isotope values representative of the mean climate signal for a sediment sample. Seven hundred and six gastropod shells were analysed, representing eight species. These eight species were most abundant and consistently present in the sediment sequence of the Paddenluch outcrop, Brandenburg, northeast Germany. Significant differences between minimum and maximum δ^sup 13^C and δ^sup 18^O values of the shells were recorded within all sediment samples and for all analysed species. Within the sediment samples, the greatest mean variability in both δ^sup 13^C and δ^sup 18^O values was found for Hippeutis complanatus, 5.84 and 5.23 [per thousand], respectively. The greatest intra-specific variability in C and O isotope values within individual sediment samples, however, was 10.2 and 6.8 [per thousand], respectively. Significant differences between minimum and maximum δ^sup 13^C and δ^sup 18^O values of individual mollusc shells within the same sediment sample are probably the result of population isotope variability, variations in species life span, thickness of the sediment sample, sediment accumulation rate, and environmental fluctuations during the time span when the sediment was deposited. Shells were randomly selected to determine the optimum number of shells necessary to obtain stable isotope values that are representative of the mean climate signal, from a 1-cm sample of sediment. For each layer of the Paddenluch sediment sequence, 15 or more shells (N [greater than or equal to] 15) was the required sample size to provide representative isotope values and yield a reliable mean isotope value. Sample sizes with fewer shells displayed more variable mean δ^sup 13^C and δ^sup 18^O values. Stable isotope composition of the analyzed molluscs was species-specific, with differences in mean δ^sup 13^C and δ^sup 18^O values of 2.5 and 3 [per thousand], respectively. This illustrates the need to use mono-specific samples throughout a sediment sequence to generate reliable data.

T1  - Application of XCMS Online and toxicity bioassays to the study of transformation products of levofloxacin
AN  - 1931066404
AB  - We studied the nature and antimicrobial activity of ozonolysis transformation products (OTPs) of levofloxacin (LEV), a frequently detected fluoroquinolone antimicrobial in environmental waters. Two bioassays, the Kirby-Bauer test and the broth microdilution assay, were used to measure changes in the antimicrobial activity of solutions at low LEV to O3 molar ratios (2:1, 2:3 and 1:3) compared to solutions without added O3 (LEV:O3 1:0). The Kirby-Bauer test was not sensitive enough to detect significant differences in the growth inhibition zones in samples LEV:O3 2:1 and LEV:O3 1:0; however, the broth microdilution assay showed that bacterial growth inhibition was significantly lower (P < 0.001) in the solutions exposed to O3. Loss of antimicrobial activity in LEV:O3 2:1 solutions of (48 ± 16)% was in agreement with the concentration decrease of LEV of (36 ± 3)% in those same samples. A method of identification of OTPs using XCMS Online was applied to LEV:O3 2:1 and 1:0 samples and indicated the presence of an OTP of LEV of formula C18H20O5N3F, which was identified as LEV-N-oxide. The molecular structure of this compound was partially confirmed by tandem mass spectrometry experiments. This study showed that even at sub-optimal ozone doses, OTPs of higher antimicrobial activity than LEV were not formed.

T1  - Analysis of Sources and Sinks of Mercury in the Urban Water Cycle of Frankfurt am Main, Germany
AN  - 1748568897
AB  - Mercury (Hg) is still a focus of environmental research, since its levels in fish frequently exceed the Environmental Quality Standard (EQS) of 20 µg/kg for biota defined by the European Water Framework Directive (Directive 2008/105/EC). Current Hg levels in Abramis brama from German rivers are in the range of 73-346 µg/kg wet weight (2009) and exceed the EQS by a factor of 3.7-17.3. Therefore, it is important to identify the sources of Hg pollution in the aquatic environment and to develop effective strategies for reducing the input into associated river systems. The aim of the present study was to analyze Hg in the urban water cycle of the city of Frankfurt am Main, Germany. Samples were taken from the river Main crosscutting the city and its tributaries. In addition, precipitation, stormwater runoff, effluents of two municipal WWTPs, and stormwater management structures such as combined sewer overflows and stormwater retention basins have been analyzed. Loads of Hg have been determined based on the measured concentrations and a Hg mass balance for the aquatic system was created. A total of 160 water samples were analyzed by cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectroscopy (CVAFS) according to US EPA Method 1631. Results from the mass balance have shown that approximately 5 kg Hg/a enter and 15 kg Hg/a leave the study area of Frankfurt am Main via the river Main. The largest amount of Hg (24.58 kg/a) throughout the urban water cycle of Frankfurt am Main is transported via wastewater. However, municipal WWTPs in Frankfurt am Main have been identified as the largest Hg sink, since 99.7% (24.5 kg/a) of the Hg is shifted from the sewage water and stormwater during treatment into the sewage sludge. Thus, the increase of the Hg load in the river Main from 5 to 15 kg/a has to be attributed to other sources such as 3 industrial WWTPs, groundwater and non-treated stormwater runoff during heavy rain events.

T1  - Denitrification Dominates Sediment Nitrogen Removal and Is Enhanced by Bottom-Water Hypoxia in the Northern Gulf of Mexico
AN  - 1720397141
AB  - Nutrient loads from the Mississippi River watershed are associated with seasonal development of bottom-water hypoxia in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Microbial nitrogen (N) transformations at the sediment-water interface are important in determining system productivity and the development and maintenance of hypoxia. Intact sediment cores were incubated in a continuous-flow system with stable isotope tracers to identify and quantify important N sources (e.g., N fixation), sinks (e.g., denitrification and anammox), and links (e.g., dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium, DNRA). Microbial N sinks on the Louisiana-Texas continental shelf remove up to 68 % of the total N load from the Mississippi River watershed, and up to 29 % of this N removal (mean=11.8±1.7 %) may be due to anammox. The highest N2 production rates and ammonium effluxes were observed at low bottom-water oxygen concentrations, and sediments were a significant source of ammonium to the water column at all times. DNRA and heterotrophic N fixation were not consistent pathways for total sediment N fluxes, but their potential importance to N balance and productivity in the system warrants further study and inclusion in ecosystem models. Physical disturbance from passage of two hurricanes in 2008 resulted in lower N cycling rates and sediment oxygen consumption, with sediment processes migrating into the water column. Denitrification is the dominant N sink in the northern Gulf of Mexico and provides a valuable ecosystem service by mitigating N loads from the Mississippi River watershed, particularly during seasonal bottom-water hypoxia events.

AB  - Histopathological changes in gills of Oreochromis sp. exposed for 96 hr with three different concentrations of clove oil, 48 mg/L, 65 mg/L and 81 mg/L were examined in this study. These concentrations were selected by 25% lower and 25% higher than LC50 value (65 mg/L). The gills were fixed in 10% FAA (formalin acetic acid) for histological observation. Severe lesions such as lamella fusion, telangiectasis and oedema were observed at 48 mg/L. At the concentration of 65 mg/L the gills exhibited the occurrence of oedema and necrosis whereas at 81 mg/L, lifting of lamella epithelium and necrosis were noticeable.

T1  - The benthic regeneration of N and P in the Great Brak estuary, South Africa
AN  - 1734300626
AB  - The Great Brak is a temporarily open/closed estuary (TOCE) located on the south coast of South Africa. The construction of the Wolwedans Dam in 1989 reduced baseflow to the estuary by 56%, decreasing the intensity of flushing events and causing t he mouth to breach less often. The aim of t his study was to investigate the flux of inorganic nutrients (NH^sup +^^sub 4^, TOxN [NO^sup -^^sub 3^ + NO^sup -^^sub 2^], SRP) as well as total N and P across the sediment-water interface in the estuary. There have been very few studies on nutrient cycling and benthic pelagic coupling in South African estuaries. This study showed t hat t he sediment had a net efflux of NH^sup +^^sub 4^, SRP, TN and TP while TOx N was taken up or converted to other forms of N. The estuary acted as a source of N and P during both summer and w inter. If the estuary remains closed for a prolonged period (12 months), with an increased organic load present on the bent hos, the associated rates of efflux of N and P would increase. In order to reduce the organic load to the system better flushing met hods or, more importantly, a n increase in base flow, is needed to reduce residence times of water in the estuary.

T1  - Molecular characterization of heat-shock protein 90 gene and its expression in Gobiocypris rarus juveniles exposed to pentachlorophenol
AN  - 1713831909
AB  - Heat-shock protein 90 (HSP90) is an abundant and highly conserved molecular chaperone, and it fulfills a housekeeping function in contributing to the folding, maintenance of structural integrity, and proper regulation of a subset of cytosolic proteins. In this study, the full-length 2693-bp cDNA of HSP90 was cloned by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) technique from the liver of rare minnow (Gobiocypris rarus) for the first time, designated as GrHSP90. The complete coding sequence of GrHSP90 is 2181 bp in length, which encodes a polypeptide of 726 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 83.4 kDa and a theoretical isoelectric point of 4.90. Phylogenetic tree analysis indicated that deduced protein GrHSP90 had extensive sequence similarities to other fish HSP90s. Tissue distribution showed that GrHSP90 was constitutively expressed in a wide range of tissues including gill, blood, brain, fin, gonad, heart, intestine, kidney, liver, muscle, spleen, skin, and swim bladder. The highest expression was found in the gonad. Furthermore, significant increase in GrHSP90 mRNA in the liver was observed after exposure to pentachlorophenol [greater than or equal to]8 µg/L (p < 0.05). Our results suggest that GrHSP90 is indeed an ortholog of the HSP90 family and may be act as a biomarker to assess the effect of environmental contaminant.

T1  - Metabolic responses of the Antarctic fishes Notothenia rossii and Notothenia coriiceps to sewage pollution
AN  - 1713831834
AB  - The present study aimed to assess the sewage effects of the Brazilian Antarctic Station Comandante Ferraz, Admiralty Bay, King George Island, on the hepatic metabolism (energetic, antioxidant, and arginase levels) and levels of plasma constituents of two Antarctic fish species Notothenia rossii and N. coriiceps. The bioassays were conducted under controlled temperature (0 °C) and salinity (35 psu), exposing the fish for 96 h, to sewage effluent diluted in seawater to 0.5 % (v/v). Liver homogenates were tested for the specific activities of the enzymes glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), glycogen phosphorylase (GPase), hexokinase, citrate synthase, lactate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase, catalase, and arginase. Plasma levels of glucose, triacylglycerides, cholesterol, total protein, albumin, chloride, magnesium, calcium, and inorganic phosphate were also determined. In N. rossii, the decrease in citrate synthase and the increase in G6Pase and GPase suggested that the sewage effluent activated glycogenolysis and hepatic gluconeogenesis, whereas is N. coriiceps, only G6Pase levels were increased. In N. rossii, sewage effluent induced hypertriglyceridemia without modulating glucose plasma levels, in contrast to N. coriiceps, which developed hypoglycemia without elevating plasma triglyceride levels. The decrease in glutathione reductase levels in N. coriiceps and in superoxide dismutase and catalase in N. rossii suggest that these two species are susceptible to oxidative stress stemming from the production of reactive oxygen species. An increase in magnesium in N. rossii and a decrease in N. coriiceps showed that sewage effluent compromised the control of plasma levels of this cation. Although phylogenetically close, both species of Antarctic fish exhibited different metabolic responses to the sewage effluent, with N. coriiceps showing greater susceptibility to the toxic effects of the pollutants. The present study suggests that the biochemical responses of these two species are potential indicators of metabolic changes caused by sewage effluents.

T1  - Anthropogenic land use is associated with N-fixing cyanobacterial dominance in lakes across the continental United States
AN  - 1712244029
AB  - Cyanobacteria cause many water quality problems in lakes worldwide. Although many studies have examined factors that influence the structure of cyanobacterial communities, few have explicitly compared the effects of within-lake conditions (e.g., nutrient concentrations) and watershed parameters (e.g., land use) on a diverse array of cyanobacterial taxa. Here, we analyzed data from the 2007 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Lakes Assessment to quantify how lakeshore anthropogenic land use, nutrient concentrations and ratios, and surface water temperatures predict cyanobacterial biovolume and dominance in 236 naturally-formed lakes spanning the continental U.S. We observed that anthropogenic lakeshore land use was the best predictor for cyanobacterial dominance, whereas in-lake nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations were the best predictors for cyanobacterial biovolume. Our analyses suggest that anthropogenic land use may influence cyanobacterial dominance via means other than increased nutrient concentrations. The sum of agricultural and human-developed lakeshore land use was the best predictor of N-fixing cyanobacterial dominance, but there was no significant relationship between anthropogenic land use and non-N-fixing cyanobacterial dominance. In addition, we observed a total N:P ratio threshold for cyanobacterial dominance in the phytoplankton community (150:1) that was much higher than previously reported ratios. Consequently, management strategies to control cyanobacteria need to account for eco-physiological variation among different cyanobacterial taxa, and should consider nutrients and the other effects of land use to control overall lake cyanobacterial biovolume and cyanobacterial dominance, as the two cyanobacterial metrics may be sensitive to different drivers.

T1  - Use of allochthonous resources by zooplankton in reservoirs
AN  - 1702196811
AB  - Aquatic food webs are supported by primary production from within the system (autochthony) as well as organic matter produced outside of and transported into the system (allochthony). Zooplankton use allochthonous resources, especially in systems with high terrestrial loading and moderate to low internal primary production. We hypothesized that due to high terrestrial loads and remnant submerged terrestrial material, allochthonous resource use by zooplankton would be significant in all reservoirs and would decline along an increasing reservoir age gradient. Using hydrogen stable isotopes and a Bayesian mixing model, we estimated the contribution of allochthonous sources to organic matter pools and crustaceous zooplankton biomass for ten reservoirs. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in all systems was dominated by allochthonous sources (posterior distribution median >92% allochthonous), while particulate organic matter (POM) composition varied (2-68% allochthonous) and had a lower allochthonous fraction in older reservoirs. There was no relationship between zooplankton allochthony and reservoir age. Crustaceous zooplankton allochthony varied among systems from 26 to 94%, and Chaoborus allochthony, measured in four reservoirs, was similarly variable (33-94%). Consumer allochthony was higher than POM allochthony in some reservoirs, potentially due to terrestrial DOM pathways being important and/or algal resources being inedible (e.g., cyanobacteria). As with many lakes, in the reservoirs we studied, allochthonous inputs account for a significant fraction of the organic matter of basal consumers.

T1  - Present and future of subsurface biosphere studies in lacustrine sediments through scientific drilling
AN  - 1709252118
AB  - Issue Title: A Snapshot of Research Findings Enabled by Scientific Drilling 

              
Recently, the discovery of active microbial life in deep-sea sediments has triggered a rapid development of the field known as the "deep biosphere." Geomicrobiological investigations in lacustrine basins have also shown a substantial microbial impact on lake sediments similar to that described for the marine record. Although only 30 % of the lake sites drilled by the International Continental Drilling Program (ICDP) have included microbial investigations, these lakes cover a relatively wide range of salinities (from 0.15 to 33.8 %), pH (from 6.0 to 9.8) and environmental conditions (from very arid to humid subtropical conditions). Here, we analyze results of very recent ICDP lake sites including subsurface biosphere research from southern Patagonia (Laguna Potrok Aike) to the Levantine area (Dead Sea) as well as the East Anatolian high plateau (Lake Van) and Macedonia (Lake Ohrid). These various settings allow the examination of the impact of contrasting environments on microbial activity and their subsequent role during early diagenesis. Furthermore, they permit the identification of biosignatures of former microbial activity recorded in the sediments as well as investigating the impact of microbes in biogeochemical cycles. One of the general outcomes of these preliminary investigations is data to support the hypothesis that microbes react to climatically driven environmental changes that have a direct impact on their subsurface distribution and diversity. This is clear at conspicuous levels associated with well-known climatic periods such as the Medieval Climatic Anomaly or the Little Ice Age. Although more research is needed, this relationship between prevailing microbial assemblages and different climatic settings appears to dominate the lacustrine sites studied until to date.

T1  - Dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) seasonally dominates NO3 ^sup -^ reduction pathways in an anthropogenically impacted sub-tropical coastal lagoon
AN  - 1699465093
AB  - Sediments have an important role in nutrient dynamics by providing sites for denitrification, which, in conjunction with nitrogen (N) fixation and other processes such as dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), can regulate ecosystem N availability. Little Lagoon, Alabama, USA, is affected by anthropogenic perturbations and has N inputs from nitrate (NO3 ^sup -^)-contaminated submarine groundwater discharge. N cycle pathways (N-fixation, denitrification, anammox, and DNRA) and benthic fluxes were measured at three sites over a year to investigate the hypothesis that DNRA, by producing ammonium (NH^sub 4^ ^sup +^) as a dissimilatory end product of NO3 ^sup -^ reduction, was a significant process retaining bioavailable fixed N in Little Lagoon. DNRA was found to be an important NO3 ^sup -^ reduction pathway, especially in the summer months (study average: 52.1 [mu]mol N m^sup -2^ h^sup -1^) compared to denitrification (study average 7.7 [mu]mol N m^sup -2^ h^sup -1^). Sulfidic sediments during the majority of the year interfere with denitrification and result in decreased N loss through denitrification. The conversion of NO3 ^sup -^ to the more biologically preferred form of N, NH^sub 4^ ^sup +^ via DNRA, means that NO3 ^sup -^ reduction has considerable nourishing potential and likely will affect both ecosystem function and services. These results indicate that NO3 ^sup -^ reduction may contribute to, rather than counteract, eutrophication during warm summers in estuaries receiving high N inputs. As estuarine sediments provide a key ecosystem function of N removal, excess anthropogenic N input jeopardizes their ability to effectively remove reactive N in Little Lagoon and likely in other impacted ecosystems.

T1  - Transcriptional Responses in Adult Zebrafish (Danio rerio) Exposed to Propranolol and Metoprolol
AN  - 1698775367
AB  - [beta]-adrenergic receptor blockers ([beta]-blockers) are widely detected in the aquatic environment; however, the effects of these pharmaceuticals on aquatic organisms remain uncertain. In this study, adult zebrafish were exposed to two different [beta]-blockers, propranolol and metoprolol, for 96 h. After exposure, the transcriptional responses of genes encoding the [beta]-adrenergic receptor (i.e., adrb1, adrb2a, adrb2b, adrb3a and adrb3b), genes involved in detoxification and the stress response (i.e., hsp70, tap, mt1 and mt2), and genes related to the antioxidant system (i.e., cu/zn-sod, mn-sod, cat and gpx) were examined in the brain, liver and gonad. Our results show that both propranolol and metoprolol exposure changes the mRNA level of [beta]-adrenergic receptors, indicating clear pharmacological target engagement of the [beta]-blockers. The transcription of genes related to antioxidant responses and detoxification process were induced, suggesting that [beta]-blocker exposure can activate the detoxification process and result in oxidative stress in fish. Moreover, the transcriptional responses displayed substantial tissue- and gender-specific effects. Considering the environmental concentrations of propranolol and metoprolol, these results suggest that these pharmaceuticals are unlikely to pose a risk to fish. However, the impacts in prolonged exposure, along with other possible side effects due to [beta]-adrenergic receptor blockade, should be further assessed.

T1  - Inorganic nitrogen exchange across the sediment-water interface in the eastern Chongming tidal flat of the Yangtze Estuary
AN  - 1695982464
AB  - Issue Title: Thematic Issue: Glacier fluctuation in northern and High Asia: historical and methods perspective

              
This study investigated environmental influences on inorganic nitrogen exchange at the sediment-water interface and quantified the function of sediment as inorganic nitrogen sink/source in the eastern Chongming tidal flat of the Yangtze Estuary. Intact sediment cores (20-25 cm deep) were collected from the high, middle and low tidal flats of the study area every 2 months from July 2012 to May 2013, and incubated to measure the fluxes of ammonium and nitrate (plus nitrite) across the sediment-water interface via continuous-flow experiments. The incubation experimental results showed that ammonium was mainly released from the sediment into the overlying water, with a flux of -5.91 to 14.44 mmol m^sup -2^ day^sup -1^. In contrast, nitrate was primarily influxed from the overlying water into the sediment, with a flux of -20.09 to 8.72 mmol m^sup -2^ day^sup -1^. In this work, temperature, salinity, sedimentary ammonium and nitrate, and total organic carbon were observed to significantly affect the dynamic exchange of inorganic nitrogen across the sediment-water interface of the study area, via controlling nitrogen transformation processes in sediments. It was also estimated that ca. 2101 t N year^sup -1^ for ammonium was totally released from the sediment to overlying water while ca. 1577 t N year^sup -1^ for nitrate was removed from the water to sediment. The dynamic exchanges of inorganic nitrogen at the sediment-water interface implied that the sediment has important influence on adjusting the levels of ammonium and nitrate in tidal water of the study area.

T1  - Chiral xenobiotics bioaccumulations and environmental health prospectives
AN  - 1694472644
AB  - The chiral xenobiotics are very dangerous for all of us due to the different enantioselective toxicities of the enantiomers. Besides, these have different enantioselective bioaccumulations and behaviors in our body and other organisms. It is of urgent need to understand the enantioselective bioaccumulations, toxicities, and the health hazards of the chiral xenobiotics. The present article describes the classification, sources of contamination, distribution, enantioselective bioaccumulation, and the toxicities of the chiral xenobiotics. Besides, the efforts are also made to discuss the prevention and remedial measures of the havoc of the chiral xenobiotics. The challenges of the chiral xenobiotics have also been highlighted. Finally, future prospectives are also discussed.

T1  - Effects of 5-Fluorouracil, Etoposide and CdCl^sub 2^ in Aquatic Oligochaeta Limnodrilus udekemianus Claparede (Tubificidae) Measured by Comet Assay
AN  - 1703893453
AB  - Genotoxicity of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), etoposide (ET) and cadmium chloride (CdCl^sub 2^) was evaluated in Limnodrilus udekemianus, cosmopolitan tubificid species, by alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay). Groups of 50 individuals were exposed in vivo in water-only short-term (96 h) tests to 5-FU (0.004, 0.04, 0.4, 4 and 40 [mu]M), ET (0.004. 0.04, 0.4 and 4 [mu]M) and CdCl^sub 2^ (0.004, 0.04, 0.4, 4 and 40 [mu]M). Mortality of worms was observed only for CdCl^sub 2^ (4 and 40 [mu]M). Cell viability lower than 70 % was detected for 5-FU (0.4, 4 and 40 [mu]M), ET (4 [mu]M) and CdCl^sub 2^ (0.4 and 4 [mu]M). All tested substances induced significant increase of DNA damage except 0.004 [mu]M of ET. L. udekemianus being sensitive to all tested substances indicates that it can be used in ecogenotoxicology studies. Concern should be raised to cytostatics, especially to 5-FU, since concentration of 0.004 [mu]M induced DNA damage is similar to ones detected in wastewaters.

T1  - Trace element concentrations in red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) and surface sediments in Lake Preola and Gorghi Tondi natural reserve, SW Sicily
AN  - 1695964197
AB  - Concentrations of trace elements (Cd, Pb, As, V, Cr, Ni, Cu and Zn) were determined in superficial sediments and in muscle and hepatopancreas tissues of the red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii from Lake Preola and Gorghi Tondi Natural Reserve (SW Sicily). In particular, hepatopancreas showed a decidedly higher content of all analysed trace elements with respect to muscles (two- to threefold higher for Cd, Cu, As, Zn and V; four- to fivefold higher for Pb and Cr and seven times higher for Ni). However, no statistically reliable differential accumulation pattern emerged with regard to length and weight for trace elements (except for Cd for which significant positive correlations with length were recorded). Trace element concentrations found in crayfish tissues were in the range considered harmful to human health (except for Cd and Cr). Moreover, the As and Pb concentrations, either in sediment or crayfish tissues, are clearly related to intense agricultural activities, with extensive use of fertilizers and pesticides, that significantly affect the levels of these toxic metals in the study area.

T1  - Biomarker responses in the bivalve Chlamys farreri to the water-soluble fraction of crude oil
AN  - 1691968909
AB  - To investigate the effect of the water soluble fraction of crude oil (WSF) on marine bivalves, the scallop Chlamys farreri was exposed to three WSF concentrations (0.18 mg/L, 0.32 mg/L, and 0.51 mg/L, respectively) in seawater. Petroleum hydrocarbon contents in scallops and a suite of enzymes [7-Ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx)] in gills and digestive glands were monitored over 10 days. The results revealed that WSF affected the activity of the four enzymes in the gills and digestive glands. EROD activity in the gills was significantly induced in most individuals of the three test groups, while in the digestive gland it was significantly induced in the low-concentration group within 4 days but was inhibited in the middle- and high-concentration groups on days 1, 4, and 10. AHH activity in the gills of all treatment groups was significantly induced on day 1. In the digestive gland, AHH activity was induced in most individuals from the treatment groups. In all treatment groups, GST activity was significantly inhibited from days 2 to 10 in the gills and was induced after day 4 in the digestive gland. GPx activity in the gills was significantly inhibited throughout the exposure period in all treatment groups. There was no overall significant difference in GPx activity in the digestive gland between the control and treatment groups. Our results also revealed that petroleum hydrocarbon concentrations in the tissues increased linearly with exposure time. EROD activity in the digestive gland and GST and GPx activity in the gill tissue were negatively correlated with petroleum hydrocarbon body burden. These enzymes play important roles in detoxification and can act as potential biomarkers for monitoring petroleum hydrocarbon contaminants in the marine environment.

T1  - Does the stoichiometric carbon:phosphorus knife edge apply for predaceous copepods?
AN  - 1682154149
AB  - Recent work has indicated that stoichiometric food quality in terms of the carbon:phosphorus (C:P) ratio affects consumers whether the imbalance involves a deficit or an excess of nutrients; hence, organisms exist on a "stoichiometric knife edge". While previous studies have focused primarily on autotroph-herbivore trophic transfer, nutritional imbalances may also affect the interactions between species at higher trophic levels. Since the foods of carnivores are normally stoichiometrically similar to the body compositions of those carnivores, they may be more severely affected than herbivores if imbalances become pronounced. We analysed the response of the predatory copepod Parabroteas sarsi to monospecific diet treatments consisting of high and low C:P prey items. These dietary treatments strongly affected the predator's elemental composition and growth, although prey selection, excretion, egestion, and respiration rates were not affected. We suggest that, due to their low threshold elemental ratio and a narrow C:P stoichiometric knife edge, these predators are highly vulnerable to stoichiometric imbalances, whether an excess or a deficit of nutrients is involved. Our results demonstrating this high sensitivity to prey C:P ratio show that the stoichiometric knife edge may apply to not only herbivores but also higher trophic levels. Thus, predators such as P. sarsi, with a much narrower range of food quality, may also be strongly affected by fluctuations in the quality of their prey, with negative consequences for their secondary production.

T1  - Cadmium Accumulation and Metallothionein Response in the Freshwater Bivalve Corbicula fluminea Under Hydrodynamic Conditions
AN  - 1679369040
AB  - Freshwater bivalves such as Corbicula fluminea (Müller) are useful biomonitors for cadmium pollution because they absorb heavy metals and accumulate them in their tissues. We exposed C. fluminea in the laboratory to natural and cadmium (Cd)-spiked sediments below flowing water in order to evaluate the organisms' Cd accumulation and metallothionein (MT) response under hydrodynamic conditions. The accumulation of Cd and the induction of MT in C. fluminea were determined at 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 16, and 23 days. Hydrodynamic conditions, represented by a water flow rate of 14 or 3.2 cm/s, increased Cd accumulation in the visceral mass, gill, foot, and mantle of C. fluminea in the first 3 or 6 days in the natural sediment. Cd concentrations in the C. fluminea tissues kept increasing over time in the three treatments, and significant differences were observed in Cd accumulation after 6 (visceral mass), 10 (foot) and 16 (gill and mantle) days among the three groups. The MT concentrations were barely affected by hydrodynamic conditions and were significantly linearly related to the Cd concentration in the visceral mass in the natural sediment and binomially related to it in the Cd-spiked sediment. Hydrodynamic conditions enhanced the accumulation of Cd in the soft tissues of C. fluminea, especially in the Cd-spiked sediment, but stronger hydrodynamic forces did not increase Cd accumulation. MT may be considered an indicator for Cd accumulation in C. fluminea under hydrodynamic conditions, but only when the Cd concentrations in the tissue remain below the toxic threshold values.

T1  - Methane gas in lake bottom sediments quantified using acoustic backscatter strength
AN  - 1673311201
AB  - Freshwater lakes and reservoirs can produce substantial quantities of methane (CH4) within bottom sediments. Due to its low solubility in water, CH4 forms bubbles that accumulate within bottom sediments and are released from sediments when buoyant forces exceed viscous, frictional, and inertial forces. Methane ebullition can enhance internal loading of nutrients and hasten release of other sediment-associated contaminants while also exporting a significant amount of C out of the lake basin and delivering a potent greenhouse gas to the atmosphere. The purpose of this study was to evaluate use of hydroacoustic measurements to remotely sense the CH4 content of sediments in lakes.

              
The acoustic signatures of bottom sediments measured using a BioSonics DT-X echosounder at 38, 201, and 430 kHz were compared with gas volumes of surficial sediments determined using a displacement method. Measurements were made on three lakes in southern California, USA that varied in depth, productivity, and other features.

              
The maximum volume backscatter strength of bottom echoes at 201 kHz was highly correlated with gas content (r ^sup 2^=0.93) and, with suitable ground-truthing, can quantify the concentration and spatial distribution of CH4 gas in soft cohesive sediments of lakes and reservoirs. As an application of this technique, the spatial distribution of CH4 within bottom sediments of Lake Elsinore was determined from a hydroacoustic survey conducted in June 2010. Results are also presented from a transect on Lake Hodges demonstrating high levels of CH4 in this eutrophic lake.

              
Hydroacoustic measurements of the maximum volume backscatter strength of soft organic sediments at 201 kHz provide a way to remotely estimate the volume of methane and other gases present in bottom sediments of lakes and reservoirs.

T1  - Effects of tetracycline on developmental toxicity and molecular responses in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos
AN  - 1670079999
AB  - The extensive use of pharmaceuticals has resulted in the intensive contamination of water bodies. Tetracycline is a type of antibiotic and its potential toxicity is causing environmental concern. The effects of developmental toxicity and the mechanisms of tetracycline on fish embryos are not well understood. Zebrafish embryos are used in this study to investigate the developmental toxicity of this compound. Four hour post-fertilization (hpf) zebrafish embryos are exposed to different concentrations of tetracycline until 96 hpf. The larvae display developmental delay phenotypes, including hatching delay, shorter body length, increased yolk sac area and uninflated swim bladder upon exposure to tetracycline. Delayed yolk sac absorption and swim bladder deficiency at 96 hpf are observed in the zebrafish larvae upon exposure to 20 [mu]g/L of tetracycline. To test whether tetracycline causes oxidative damage and the resulting oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), Acridine Orange staining and real time polymerase chain reaction have been performed in this study. The results indicate that tetracycline exposure results in significant increases in ROS production and cell apoptosis, mainly in the tail areas at 96 hpf. The gene expression pattern demonstrates that tetracycline induces ROS which causes apoptosis in the zebrafish larvae, and the results also indicate that caspase-dependent apoptotic pathways may greatly contribute to tetracycline-induced apoptosis in the early-life stages of the zebrafish. In addition, we have investigated the effects of tetracycline on marker genes related to resistance mechanisms and gene regulating drug biotransformation. The results of these gene expression studies indicate that tetracycline could induce zebrafish to resist pharmaceuticals and Cytochrome P450s that are involved in the biotransformation of tetracycline in zebrafish larvae. The overall results indicate that tetracycline can produce oxidative stress and induce apoptosis, which brings about significant developmental delay in zebrafish embryos.

T1  - Age and origin of Australian Bennelongia (Crustacea, Ostracoda)
AN  - 1657499307
AB  - Issue Title: Emerging Trends in Aquatic Ecology              South-western Australia holds an exceptional number of endemic taxa and has been recognized as a biodiversity hotspot at a global scale. We report a much higher diversity in the genus Bennelongia (Ostracoda) in Western than in eastern Australia. Using mitochondrial COI sequence data for phylogenies, relative age estimates, lineage-through-time plots, and reconstructions of ancestral distributions, we test four hypotheses that might explain the higher diversity and endemicity in Western Australia. (1) We find no evidence for ancient relictualism as most Bennelongia species are probably of Miocene age. (2) There are also no apparent links to vicariant events: speciation has mostly taken place in Western Australia and has been ongoing through the evolutionary history of Bennelongia. (3) Dispersal has apparently not negatively affected Western Australian Bennelongia endemicity although these ostracods produce drought-resistant eggs. We report one case of recent long distance dispersal in B. dedeckkeri with genetically identical populations occurring more than 2,000 km apart. (4) Since speciation has been ongoing, there is no evidence of recent explosive speciation through genetic isolation. The underlying mechanisms of Bennelongia speciation thus remain elusive, although speciation has mostly occurred during a period of increasing aridification of Australia.

T1  - Response and recovery of rice (Oryza sativa) seedlings to irrigation with microcystin-contaminated water
AN  - 1772279010
AB  - Irrigation with microcystin-contaminated water threatens plant growth and human health. We studied the accumulation of microcystins, growth, and photosynthesis in rice exposed to different concentrations microcystins (0, 1, 100, 1,000, and 3,000 [mu]g L^sup -1^) for 7 days and then without microcystins for 7 days. After a 7-day exposure, the accumulation of microcystins in roots was the highest. High concentration microcystins ([greater than or equal to]100 [mu]g L^sup -1^) inhibited growth, and decreased photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll content. The decrease was positively correlated with microcystins concentrations. After a 7-day restoration, the accumulation of microcystins in organs was lower than that during the exposure period. The dry weight of roots and leaves in rice seedlings treated with 100 [mu]g L^sup -1^ was not significantly different from those of the control, although photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll content in rice seedlings treated with 100 [mu]g L^sup -1^ were still lower than those of the control. However, growth and photosynthesis in rice seedlings treated with 1,000 or 3,000 [mu]g L^sup -1^ microcystins were still lower than those of the control, even worse than those during the exposure period, indicating an irreversible inhibition of microcystins to plants at high concentrations of microcystins. Our results imply that irrigation with microcystin-contaminated water must be monitored and controlled to avoid harmful accumulation of microcystins and damage to plant growth.

T1  - Tissue targeting of the European flat oyster, Ostreaedulis, using microencapsulated microbeads as a biological proxy
AN  - 1663342990
AB  - Expansion of the aquaculture industry has been accompanied by outbreaks of disease from an ever increasing range of pathogens. Such outbreaks pose serious limitations to the growth and sustainability of the seafood industry, necessitating the development of alternative methods to combat disease. Immunostimulants are currently being pursued as an effective alternative to the use of traditional antibiotics. However, for suspension feeding bivalves, an effective system whereby immunostimulants can be successfully delivered to the site of infection at appropriate times is lacking. In recent years, the process of microencapsulation using non-toxic and biodegradable coatings has been an effective and stable delivery system for the administration of probiotics. In this study, SMA microbeads encapsulated in alginate were used as a biological proxy for the delivery of immunostimulants to the European flat oyster, Ostrea edulis. Chitosan- and poly-l-lysine-coated and uncoated alginate microcapsules were used, and the route of intake and transportation to the various oyster tissue types was assessed histologically. Results demonstrated that bivalves readily ingest microalginates, which are broken up in the gut liberating the SMA microbeads. The SMA microbeads successfully cross the digestive epithelium and disperse into the surrounding tissue. The microbeads were also actively taken up by the oyster hemocytes. This study demonstrated that microencapsulation in alginate can serve as an efficient immunostimulant delivery system for bivalves, providing alternative treatment options for effective disease management and control.

T1  - Short and long-term exposure to diclofenac alter oxidative stress status in common carp Cyprinus carpio
AN  - 1661946326
AB  - Diclofenac (DCF) has been detected in significant amounts in municipal treated wastewater effluent. Diverse studies report that trace concentrations of DCF may induce toxic effects on different aquatic organisms as well as developmental, reproductive and renal damage. This study aimed to determine whether short and long-term exposure to DCF alter the oxidative stress (OS) status in blood, muscle, gills, brain and liver of common carp Cyprinus carpio. The median lethal concentration of DCF at 96 h (96-h LC^sub 50^) and subsequently the lowest observed adverse effect level were determined. Carp were exposed (short and long-term) to the latter value for different exposure times (4 and 24 days) and the following biomarkers were evaluated in gill, brain, liver and blood: hydroperoxides content (HPC), lipid peroxidation (LPX), protein carbonyl content (PCC) and the activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). Also, the DCF was determined by LC-MS/MS. Significant increases in HPC, LPX and PCC were observed respect to control (P < 0.05) particularly in blood, muscle, gill, brain and liver. SOD, CAT and GPx activity also increased in these organs, with respect to controls (P < 0.05). DCF concentrations decreased and increased in water system and carp, respectively. Cyprinus carpio exposed to DCF was affected in OS status during the initial days of the study (at 4 days), exhibiting an increased response at 24 days in blood and liver. In contrast, a decrease was observed in muscle, gills and brain at 24 days with respect to 4 days. In conclusion, DCF induces OS on blood, muscle, gills, brain and liver in the carp C. carpio in short and long-term exposure. The biomarkers employed in this study are useful in the assessment of the environmental impact of this agent on aquatic species.

T1  - Effects of flow regime on growth rate in freshwater drum, Aplodinotus grunniens
AN  - 1658650959
AB  - Understanding the influence of flow regime hydrology on fish life history is essential for conservation and management of lotic ecosystems. The objectives of this study were to investigate growth patterns of Wabash River freshwater drum Aplodinotus grunniens relative to age, sex, and long term flow regime variation. Growth was estimated using back-calculated lengths from otolith measurements. Flow regime was described using Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration flow metrics calculated from long-term stream flow data at USGS stations. A generalized linear mixed model was used to model growth as a function of age, sex, and flow regime. Freshwater drum growth was explained by variation in age, sex, and flow magnitude. Freshwater drum exhibited indeterminate growth relative to age. Mean growth rates and mean length at age were lower in males than females. High magnitude flow events were positively correlated with increased growth rates in both males and females. However, the effect of flow magnitude variation on growth was stronger in males. The primary flow regime metrics related to growth were magnitude-based and were not related to timing of flow events. The study provides evidence that long term variation in flow regime is a catalyst for alterations in freshwater drum growth rates.

T1  - Toxic Picoplanktonic Cyanobacteria-Review
AN  - 1672888722
AB  - Cyanobacteria of a picoplanktonic cell size (0.2 to 2.0 µm) are common organisms of both freshwater and marine ecosystems. However, due to their small size and relatively short study history, picoplanktonic cyanobacteria, in contrast to the microplanktonic cyanobacteria, still remains a poorly studied fraction of plankton. So far, only little information on picocyanobacteria toxicity has been reported, while the number of reports concerning their presence in ecosystems is increasing. Thus, the issue of picocyanobacteria toxicity needs more researchers' attention and interest. In this report, we present information on the current knowledge concerning the picocyanobacteria toxicity, as well as their harmfulness and problems they can cause.

T1  - Degradation of forchlorfenuron by nitrification and denitrification reactions in the gut and shell biofilm of Limnoperna fortunei
AN  - 1655078845
AB  - The capacity and mechanism of Limnoperna fortunei to reduce the concentration of forchlorfenuron [or 1-(2-chloropyridin-4-yl)-3-phenylurea (CPPU)] in water has been studied under laboratory conditions. Firstly, the evasive response of mussels to CPPU (10, 20, 40 and 60 mg L^sup -1^) was evaluated, and a toxicity test was carried out at these concentrations. Secondly, the effect of two different sizes of mussels on CPPU concentrations was investigated in a 24-day experiment. Thirdly, the role of intact mussels and valvae only were respectively evaluated in another 24-day experiment. The CPPU concentration decreased by about 40 % in the presence of large mussels and about 20 % in the presence of valvae only. Finally, nucleic acid extracts from the gut and biofilm microbial communities of L. fortunei were analyzed, and the number of copies of the bacterial genes amoA, nirK and nirS were determined. Based on these results, we propose possible mechanisms for CPPU degradation involving bacteria-associated nitrification and denitrification reactions. In summary, we found that the CPPU half-life depended on the presence of mussels, their size and their associated microorganisms.

T1  - Joint toxicity of sediment-associated DDT and copper to a polychaete, Nereis succinea
AN  - 1655078839
AB  - As major components in antifouling paints, both dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and copper are ubiquitous in estuarine sediment and have been detected at high concentrations in the harbors in South China. In the present study joint toxicity between DDT and copper to an estuarine polychaete, Nereis succinea, was examined using bioaccumulation potential, growth impairment and change in lipid peroxidation contents as sub-lethal endpoints. In general, the toxicity of DDXs (DDT and its metabolites) and copper acted independently and copper was more toxic to the lugworms at environmentally relevant concentrations. Nevertheless, co-exposure to copper led to a significant reduction in the bioaccumulation of DDXs when the concentrations of DDXs in sediment were high. The inhibition of DDX bioaccumulation by copper may be partially explained by the decrease in the bioavailability of sediment-associated DDXs which were estimated by biomimetic gut fluid extraction. The saturation of the solubilization agents or the inhibition of protease activity in gut fluid of N. succinea by copper limited the DDX bioavailability and the subsequent bioaccumulation.

T1  - Analytical approaches to support current understanding of exposure, uptake and distributions of engineered nanoparticles by aquatic and terrestrial organisms
AN  - 1655078772
AB  - Initiatives to support the sustainable development of the nanotechnology sector have led to rapid growth in research on the environmental fate, hazards and risk of engineered nanoparticles (ENP). As the field has matured over the last 10 years, a detailed picture of the best methods to track potential forms of exposure, their uptake routes and best methods to identify and track internal fate and distributions following assimilation into organisms has begun to emerge. Here we summarise the current state of the field, focussing particularly on metal and metal oxide ENPs. Studies to date have shown that ENPs undergo a range of physical and chemical transformations in the environment to the extent that exposures to pristine well dispersed materials will occur only rarely in nature. Methods to track assimilation and internal distributions must, therefore, be capable of detecting these modified forms. The uptake mechanisms involved in ENP assimilation may include a range of trans-cellular trafficking and distribution pathways, which can be followed by passage to intracellular compartments. To trace toxicokinetics and distributions, analytical and imaging approaches are available to determine rates, states and forms. When used hierarchically, these tools can map ENP distributions to specific target organs, cell types and organelles, such as endosomes, caveolae and lysosomes and assess speciation states. The first decade of ENP ecotoxicology research, thus, points to an emerging paradigm where exposure is to transformed materials transported into tissues and cells via passive and active pathways within which they can be assimilated and therein identified using a tiered analytical and imaging approach.

T1  - Engineered biofiltration for ultrafiltration fouling mitigation and disinfection by-product precursor control
AN  - 1930815768
AB  - A pilot-scale study was conducted to evaluate the impact of several biofiltration enhancement strategies in terms of organic removal to reduce disinfection by-product (DBP) formation potential and mitigate ultrafiltration (UF) fouling. Strategies included nutrient addition (nitrogen and phosphorus) to optimize metabolic degradation of organics, use of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, peroxide) to improve filter run times, and the application of in-line aluminum sulphate (alum) for biopolymer removal. The impact of media type on performance was also examined (anthracite versus granular activated carbon (GAC)). Passive biofiltration (without enhancement) reduced dissolved organic carbon (∼5%), biopolymers (∼20%), and trihalomethane and haloacetic acid precursors (∼20% and ∼12%, respectively) while mitigating UF irreversible fouling (∼60%). Nutrient addition was not observed to enhance biological performance. Addition of 0.5 mg/L hydrogen peroxide decreased head loss by up to 45% without affecting organic removal; however at a dosage of 1 mg/L, it negatively impacted both UF fouling and DBP precursor removal. In-line alum addition prior to biofiltration (<0.5 mg/L) improved UF fouling control by up to 40%, without sacrificing head loss. Overall, GAC provided superior performance when compared to anthracite.

T1  - In silico and in vivo analysis of binding affinity of estrogens with estrogen receptor alpha in Channa punctatus (Bloch)
AN  - 1647888783
AB  - In the present study, potential interaction between natural estrogens i.e., estrone (E^sub 1^), estradiol (E^sub 2^) and estriol (E^sub 3^) with human estrogen receptor (hER) was seen by in silico study. Molecular docking studies were carried out using Glide and ligand docking program. The binding affinity, assessed by Glide score, indicates stronger interaction of E^sub 3^ with hER followed by E^sub 2^ and E^sub 1^. Real-time PCR analysis of vga and vgb expressions, in the liver of different groups of Channa punctatus injected with the three natural estrogens, supported the docking analysis and indicated E^sub 3^ to be the most potent estrogen in inducing vga and vgb expressions followed by E^sub 2^ and E^sub 1^. This study lays the groundwork for studying interactions of various estrogenic substances with different estrogen receptors and to assess estrogenicity of various chemicals which are being released into the environment by employing molecular docking technique.

T1  - Denitrification and Anaerobic Ammonium Oxidization Across the Sediment-Water Interface in the Hypereutrophic Ecosystem, Jinpu Bay, in the Northeastern Coast of China
AN  - 1644078988
AB  - Denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidization (anammox) are considered the most important processes of removing reactive nitrogen from natural aquatic environments. We measured and compared in situ rates of the two processes across the sediment-water interface of Jinpu Bay using continuous-flow experiments combined with a ^sup 15^NO3 ^sup -^ tracing technique to determine their relative importance in this hypereutrophic coastal ecosystem. Rates of denitrification and anammox ranged from 1.76 to 327.97 and 0.33 to 36.32 [mu]mol N m^sup -2^ day^sup -1^, respectively. Both the denitrification and anammox processes were observed to be associated closely with the bioavailability of organic matter and concentrations of sulfide and iron oxides in sediments. Denitrification was the dominant pathway of eliminating reactive nitrogen and on average accounted for about 90 % of the total removed nitrogen. Totally, both the denitrification and anammox processes removed about 20 % of the externally derived inorganic nitrogen within the system. Most of the external nitrogen was still retained in the ecosystem, which may cause the severe eutrophication and algae blooms occurring at the study area.

AB  - Tropical coastal areas are sensitive ecosystems to climate change, mainly due to sea level rise and increasing water temperatures. Furthermore, they may be subject to numerous stresses, including heat releases from energy production. The Urias coastal lagoon (SE Gulf of California), a subtropical tidal estuary, receives cooling water releases from a thermoelectric power plant, urban and industrial wastes, and shrimp farm discharges. In order to evaluate the plant thermal impact, we measured synchronous temperature time series close to and far from the plant. Furthermore, in order to discriminate the thermal pollution impact from natural variability, we used a high-resolution hydrodynamic model forced by, amongst others, cooling water release as a continuous flow (7.78 m^sup 3^ s^sup -1^) at 6 °C overheating temperature. Model results and field data indicated that the main thermal impact was temporally restricted to the warmest months, spatially restricted to the surface layers (above 0.6 m) and distributed along the shoreline within 100 m of the release point. The methodology and results of this study can be extrapolated to tropical coastal lagoons that receive heat discharges.

T1  - Interaction of Carbon Nanomaterial Fullerene (C^sub 60^) and Microcystin-LR in Gills of Fish Cyprinus carpio (Teleostei: Cyprinidae) Under the Incidence of Ultraviolet Radiation
AN  - 1636621991
AB  - One of the most widely used carbon nanomaterials is fullerene (C^sub 60^), a lipophilic organic compound that potentially can behave as a carrier of toxic molecules, enhancing the entry of environmental contaminants in specific organs. Microcystins (MC) are cyanotoxins very toxic for human and environmental health. Several studies showed that exposure to MC or C^sub 60^ generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) and changes in antioxidant levels. Also, another factor that can come to enhance the toxic potential of both MC and C^sub 60^ is UVA radiation. Therefore, it was evaluated the effects on oxidative stress parameters of ex vivo co-exposure of MC and C^sub 60^ (5 mg/l) in gills of the fish Cyprinus carpio under UVA radiation incidence. The results showed that (a) there was a loss of antioxidant capacity after low MC concentration (L, 50 [mu]g/l) + C^sub 60^ co-exposure under UVA, (b) C^sub 60^ under UVA decreased glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity, (c) high MC concentration (H, 200 [mu]g/l) + C^sub 60^ co-exposure decreased the concentrations of glutathione (GSH) under UVA or in the dark, (d) L under UVA increased lipid peroxidation, and (e) C^sub 60^ did not cause a higher bioaccumulation of MC in gills. The lowering of GSH in H + C^sub 60^ co-exposure should compromise MC detoxification mediated by GST, although toxin accumulation is not influenced by C^sub 60^.

T1  - The influence of fluctuating ramping rates on the diets of small-bodied fish species of boreal rivers
AN  - 1628721700
AB  - The response of aquatic organisms to flow regulation at hydro facilities has become a key issue for the development of sustainable management practices intending to reduce the impact in regulated rivers. In previous studies, unrestricted ramping rates have been found to have a negative effect on invertebrate communities and shortened the length of the food web. The decrease in the length of the food web was inferred from a significant decrease in the difference between macroinvertebrates and fish δ^sup 13^N signatures, equivalent to the loss of the one trophic level. A before-after-control-impact (BACI) design was applied to determine the possible effects of ramping rate restrictions on the diet of small-bodied fishes in a boreal river in northern Ontario. Stomach contents were identified to the taxonomic level of order. Using these data, abundance, diversity and taxa composition were calculated to yield an understanding of the alterations that occurred in the food web, and how fish species diets may have changed to compensate for the shift in the invertebrate trophic level. It was found that unrestricted ramping rates were associated with an increase in invertebrate abundance within the stomach contents. There was no effect from the change to unlimited ramping for both stomach content EPT abundance and species diversity, as both rivers followed a similar trend over time. After unrestricted ramping rates, a greater frequency of baseline taxa and a lower frequency of predatory macroinvertebrates were found within the altered river stomach contents compared to what was expected. This demonstrates that the diets of small-bodied fishes have changed to compensate for the alterations to the food web due to unrestricted ramping rates, and implies that ramping rates should be taken into consideration in the regulation of operating regimes on altered rivers.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Oxidative Stress-Mediated Apoptosis and Genotoxicity Induced by Silver Nanoparticles in Freshwater Snail Lymnea luteola L.
AN  - 1628174016; 25351851
AB  - Silver is one of the most toxic metals to freshwater aquatic organisms. Limited efforts have been made to study apoptosis and genotoxic potential of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in freshwater snail Lymnea luteola L. (L. luteola). Therefore, the present investigation was aimed to study the induction of apoptosis and DNA damage by AgNPs in L. luteola. AgNPs showed molluscicidal activity against L. luteola and three concentrations of AgNPs were selected, the concentration I (4 [mu]g/l), concentration II (12 [mu]g/l), and the concentration III (24 [mu]g/l). Induction of oxidative stress in snail hemolymph was observed by a decrease in reduced glutathione (GSH) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) levels at different concentration of AgNPs, and on the other hand, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels increased at lower concentrations but decreased in higher concentration of AgNPs. Catalase (CAT) activity was also decreased at lower concentrations and increased in higher concentration of AgNPs. Flow cytometry data showed that AgNPs exposed hemocyte cells promote apoptotic and necrotic-mediated cell death when AgNPs concentrations were 12 and 24 [mu]g/l compared to control. DNA damage scores increased with the exposure levels of AgNPs, and dose- and time-dependent effects were observed. A significant positive correlation was observed among reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, apoptosis, and DNA damage. The study suggests that ROS may be involved in inducing apoptosis and DNA damage in the AgNPs exposed hemocyte cells of L. luteola. This study demonstrates that AgNPs is lethal to freshwater snail L. luteola.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Escape performance of temperate king scallop, Pecten maximus under ocean warming and acidification
AN  - 1624877468
AB  - Among bivalves, scallops are exceptional due to their capacity to escape from predators by swimming which is provided by rapid and strong claps that are produced by the phasic muscle interspersed with tonic muscle contractions. Based on the concept of oxygen and capacity-limited thermal tolerance, the following hypothesis was tested: ocean warming and acidification (OWA) would induce disturbances in aerobic metabolic scope and extracellular acid-case status and impair swimming performance in temperate scallops. Following long-term incubation under near-future OWA scenarios [20 vs. 10 °C (control) and 0.112 kPa CO2 (hypercapnia) vs. 0.040 kPa CO2 (normocapnic control)], the clapping performance and metabolic rates (MR) were measured in resting (RMR) and fatigued (maximum MR) king scallops, Pecten maximus, from Roscoff, France. Exposure to OA, either alone or combined with warming, left MR and swimming parameters such as the total number of claps and clapping forces virtually unchanged. Only the duration of the escape response was affected by OA which caused earlier exhaustion in hyper- than in normocapnic scallops at 10 °C. While maximum MR was unaffected, warm exposure increased RMR in both normocapnic and hypercapnic P. maximus resulting in similar Q ^sub 10^ values of ~2.2. The increased costs of maintenance and the observation of strongly reduced haemolymph PO2 levels indicate that at 20 °C scallops have reached the upper thermal pejus range with unbalanced capacities for aerobic energy metabolism. As a consequence, warming to 20 °C decreased mean phasic force during escape performance until fatigue. The observed prolonged recovery time in warm incubated scallops might be a consequence of elevated metabolic costs at reduced oxygen availability in the warmth.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Plantigrade settlement of the mussel Mytilus coruscus in response to natural biofilms on different surfaces
AN  - 1618219626
AB  - Surface properties affect the attachment of micro- and macroscopic marine organisms. The current study examined the settlement response of the mussel Mytilus coruscus plantigrades to natural biofilms formed on surfaces of different wettability. The percentages of plantigrade settlement were not influenced by the biofilms formed on variously wettable surfaces in the short term, but after 10 days, the plantigrade settlement rates decreased on biofilms formed on lower wettability surfaces. In general, lower wettability of the surfaces resulted in the decrease of the dry weight, bacterial and diatom density and the thickness of natural biofilms when compared to high wettability surfaces. In contrast, chlorophyll-a concentration in biofilms was independent of the initial wettability of the surfaces. Comparative cluster analysis of bacterial denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis patterns revealed that high variability existed between the bacterial community on high wettability surfaces and that on low wettability surfaces. Thus, surface wettability affects the formation of natural biofilms, and this variation in biofilms developed on different wettability surfaces may explain the discrepancy in their corresponding inducing activities on M. coruscus plantigrade settlement. This finding provides new insight into interactions between mussel settlement, biofilm characteristics and surface properties.

T1  - Fluoride concentrations in the pineal gland, brain and bone of goosander (Mergus merganser) and its prey in Odra River estuary in Poland
AN  - 1618067459; 24744187
AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate fluoride concentrations in bone, brain and pineal gland of goosander Mergus merganser wintering in the Odra estuary (Poland) as well as in fish originating from its digestive tract. The fluoride concentrations were determined with potentiometric method. Medians of concentrations in goosander had the highest and the lowest values in pineal gland and brain (>760 and <190 mg/kg, respectively). Fluoride concentration in the pineal gland was significantly greater than in the bone and the brain of the duck. In fish, the fluoride concentration ranged from 37 to 640 mg/kg and significant correlation was revealed between the fluoride concentration and fish weight and length. Based on own results and data of other authors, a daily fluoride intake by the goosander in the Odra estuary was estimated at 15 mg. So high fluoride concentrations like in the duck have not been found in mammal brains.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Top-Down Effects of an Exotic Serpulid Polychaete on Natural Plankton Assemblage of Estuarine and Brackish Systems in the SW Atlantic
AN  - 1629594204
AB  - The invasive reef-building polychaete Ficopomatus enigmaticus (Fauvel, 1923) has become well-established in many temperate brackish waters. To analyze preferences for different planktonic food sources, short-term, grazing microcosm experiments were performed in situ, at two water bodies, a coastal lagoon (Mar Chiquita, MC) and the mixohaline stretches of a coastal creek (La Tigra, LT), Argentina, in January 2007. Relative clearance rates of phytoplankton were assessed for chlorophyll a size-fractions and for different groups of nanoplanktonic and microplanktonic protists. The two locations showed significant differences in plankton community structure. Nanoeukaryotes were the dominant group at both locations; the second most-abundant groups were diatoms at MC and ciliates at LT. Significant differences in clearance for different components of the community suggest that F. enigmaticus has the potential to promote changes in plankton community structure and, hence, exerts strong top-down controls.

T1  - Zooplankton community structure in relation to environmental factors and ecological assessment of water quality in the Harbin Section of the Songhua River
AN  - 1618067130
AB  - To study the relationship between zooplankton community structure and environmental factors and water quality in the Harbin Section of the Songhua River, investigations were carried out in June, August, and October 2011. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and saprobic indices were used to process and analyze the data. Seasonal variability was identified as a significant source of variation, which explains the fluctuation in zooplankton density. In autumn, the dry season, water residence time increased and zooplankton biomass and abundance accumulated in the slow flowing waters. Zooplankton abundance increased when food conditions improved. Therefore, the total zooplankton abundance in autumn is much higher than that in spring and summer. According to the saprobic indices, all the sample sites had mesosaprobic water and water quality was worse in autumn. CCA revealed that temperature accounted for most of the spatial variation in the zooplankton community. Moreover, pH, dissolved oxygen saturation, and turbidity were important factors affecting zooplankton community distribution.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Development and applicability assessment of 1-D water quality model in nakdong river
AN  - 1612837953
AB  - Nakdong River passes through many urbanized cities, industrial complex areas, and water intake stations. Recently eight multipurpose weirs are constructed in the middle of the river. therefore the proper water quality management is crucial in this region. Reviewing existing model for hydraulic and water quality analysis, none was found able to reflect the features of the Nakdong River accurately. This study developed 1 dimensional hydraulic and water quality analysis model, where a stable hydraulic analysis is achieved by considering fixed and movable weirs as internal boundary conditions to reflect low flow conditions and irregular channel cross-sections, and the results are then used to construct a water quality analysis model. A sensitivity analysis is performed to review the proper range of parameters for the proposed model, while the applicability and reproducibility are reviewed in comparison to the EFDC model. As a result, the proposed model showed better results than the EFDC model for the hydraulic analysis, while the predicted water quality results were comparable to the two models, although the proposed model showed a high applicability due to its short simulation time.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Comparison of the sensitivity of seven marine and freshwater bioassays as regards antidepressant toxicity assessment
AN  - 1609060173; 25185786
AB  - The hazards linked to pharmaceutical residues like antidepressants are currently a major concern of ecotoxicology because they may have adverse effects on non-target aquatic organisms. Our study assesses the ecotoxicity of three antidepressants (fluoxetine, sertraline and clomipramine) using a battery of marine and freshwater species representing different trophic levels, and compares the bioassay sensitivity levels. We selected the following bioassays: the algal growth inhibition test (Skeletonema marinoi and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata), the microcrustacean immobilization test (Artemia salina and Daphnia magna), development and adult survival tests on Hydra attenuata, embryotoxicity and metamorphosis tests on Crassostrea gigas, and in vitro assays on primary cultures of Haliotis tuberculata hemocytes. The results showed high inter-species variability in EC^sub 50^-values ranging from 43 to 15,600 µg/L for fluoxetine, from 67 to 4,400 µg/L for sertraline, and from 4.70 µg/L to more than 100,000 µg/L for clomipramine. Algae (S. marinoi and P. subcapitata) and the embryo-larval stages of the oyster C. gigas were the most sensitive taxa. This raises an issue due to their ecological and/or economic importance. The marine crustacean A. salina was the least sensitive species. This difference in sensitivity between bioassays highlights the importance of using a test battery.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Evolution of ancient lake bivalves: the Lymnocardiinae (Cardiidae) of the Caspian Sea
AN  - 1563008180
AB  - Issue Title: Speciation in Ancient Lakes - Classic Concepts and New Approaches

              
The Caspian Sea as the largest continental water body in the world is known for its comparably high levels of biodiversity and endemism, also in mollusks. The evolution of a euryhaline taxon of cardiid bivalves, the Lymnocardiinae of the Ponto-Caspian region, remains unclear today. We studied material from the whole recent range of Lymnocardiinae (i.e., the Caspian, the Azov, and the Black Seas) using a LSU rDNA phylogeny aiming at (a) testing the monophyly of Lymnocardiinae and (b) determining the phylogenetic relationships within Cardiidae. Lymnocardiinae s.str. were monophyletic, i.e., a distinct group that included species of Hypanis, Didacna, and Monodacna. Lymnocardiinae as often understood, i.e., including Cerastoderma, are not monophyletic in our analysis and Cerastoderma should thus be transferred to Cardiinae. The Lymnocardiinae s.str. had a shallow tree topology and were poorly resolved. No clearcut biogeographical pattern could be derived from the phylogeny, i.e., species stemming from respective Ponto-Caspian regions, do not necessarily cluster together. We discuss a scenario of the evolutionary history and biogeographical (as well as taxonomic) implications. Given the complex history of the Ponto-Caspian region and the Caspian Sea in particular, the Lymnocardiinae would represent an interesting study object for addressing the consequences of environmental changes on biotic evolution at various spatial and temporal scales.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AN  - 1620230761
AB  - This paper seeks to identify the biomarker response to oxidative stress in Astyanax bimaculatus, a freshwater fish, collected from the Una River and its associated water bodies. The fish were collected using fishing nets at three different points on the river basin, namely Fazenda Piloto (FP), Ipiranga (IP) and Remédios (RM), during the period from December 2013 to March 2014. Physical and chemical analyses of the water at the sample locations indicate that IP and RM possibly have larger concentration of either natural or anthropic pollutants as compared to FP. FP can therefore be considered as the point less impacted by pollutants than other points. Hepatic activity of antioxidant stress enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), were measured in the specimens. The levels of SOD were reduced at RM while they were elevated in fish collected at IP. The CAT levels for the fish at RM and IP were about 148.9% and 202.4% above the values at FP, respectively. These results suggest that antioxidant enzymes could be used as biomarkers to measure oxidative stress caused by pollutants in the Una River Basin.

T1  - Comparative analysis of total carotenoid content in tissues of purple and white inner-shell color pearl mussel, Hyriopsis cumingii
AN  - 1560728321
AB  - The freshwater pearl mussel Hyriopsis cumingii is the most important mussel species for freshwater pearl production in China. Mussel shell color is an important indicator of pearl quality. The objective of this study was to assess whether total carotenoid content (TCC) in H. cumingii is related to shell color. TCC of different tissues (gonad, gill, hepatopancreas, kidney, axe foot, mantle, and adductor muscle) of purple and white inner-shell H. cumingii was determined by UV-Vis spectrophotometry. The results revealed that TCC ranged from 12.91 ± 0.78 to 56.30 ± 0.74 [mu]g/g. In general, TCC was higher in the hepatopancreas, followed by the mantle, gonad, gill, kidney, axe foot, and adductor muscle. TCC in gonad, gill, hepatopancreas, kidney, and mantle of purple mussels was significantly higher than that of white mussels. TCC in mussel tissues of H. cumingii was significantly different (P < 0.001) with respect to shell color. There were significant positive correlations between TCC in mussel mantle and shell color intensity. Future studies will assess the biological roles of carotenoids in shell color formation.

T1  - Interspecific and locational differences in metal levels in edible fish tissue from Saudi Arabia
AN  - 1558370420
AB  - Metal levels in fish have been extensively studied, but little data currently exists for the Middle East. We examined the levels of metals and metalloids (aluminum, arsenic, copper, manganese, selenium, zinc, and mercury) in the flesh of 13 fish species collected from three fishing sites and a local fish market in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. We tested the following null hypotheses: (1) there are no interspecific differences in metal levels, (2) there are no differences in metal levels in fishes between market and fishing sites, (3) there are no size-related differences in metal levels, and (4) there are no differences in selenium:mercury molar ratio among different fish species. There were significant interspecific differences in concentrations for all metals. There was an order of magnitude difference in the levels of aluminum, arsenic, mercury, manganese, and selenium, indicating wide variation in potential effects on the fish themselves and on their predators. Fishes from Area II, close to a large commercial port, had the highest levels of arsenic, mercury, and selenium, followed by market fishes. Mercury was positively correlated with body size in 6 of the 13 fish species examined. Mercury was correlated positively with arsenic and selenium, but negatively with aluminum, cobalt, copper, manganese, and zinc. Selenium:mercury molar ratios varied significantly among species, with Carangoides bajad, Cephalopholis argus, Variola louti, and Ephinephelus tauvina having ratios below 10:1. These findings can be used in risk assessments, design of mercury reduction plans, development of fish advisories to protect public health, and future management decision-making.

T1  - Biogeography of freshwater fishes of the Balkan Peninsula
AN  - 1551809001
AB  - Delineating biogeographical regions is a critical step towards the establishment and evaluation of conservation priorities. In the present study, we analysed the distribution patterns of the freshwater fish of an understudied European biodiversity hotspot, the Balkan Peninsula. Based on the most extensive available database of native freshwater fish species distributions, we performed a hierarchical clustering analysis to identify the major biogeographical regions of the Balkan Peninsula. We also highlighted the 'hottest hotspots' of freshwater fish diversity across the delimited biogeographical regions by describing the patterns of species richness, endemic and vulnerable species; indicator species were also determined. The bioregionalisation scheme consisted of eight groups of drainage basins that correspond to distinct regions of the Balkan Peninsula. Overall, the delineated biogeographical regions varied in terms of species richness, endemism, vulnerability (i.e. extinction threats) and indicator species composition. From a conservation perspective, this study emphasises the prioritisation of areas characterised by high levels of irreplaceability (endemism) and vulnerability (i.e. the Attikobeotia region, Ionian Sea and Prespa Lakes) and stresses the necessity of implementing a network of protected freshwater areas across the Balkan Peninsula.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Evaluation of Clostridium perfringens as a tracer of sewage contamination in sediments by two enumeration methods
AN  - 1548506172; 24833022
AB  - A traditional method of enumerating Clostridium perfringens using membrane filtration (MF) as an indicator of fecal contamination was compared to recently developed rapid method using Rapid Fung Double Tube (RFDT) in an evaluation to characterize the extent of sewage contamination in sediments of the Great Lakes. Evaluation of these two methods included determining C. perfringens concentrations and recovery efficiencies from sewage, sewage-spiked sediments, and water (surface and bottom) and sediment samples collected from two Great Lakes. The RFDT method proved to be a superior method for identifying C. perfringens in lake sediments compared to MF, as it had higher recovery efficiency and was more rapid, reliable, simple, and effective. This study provides biological evidence of the long-term deposition and movement of sewage particulates in the Great Lakes environment and demonstrates the potential usefulness of C. perfringens as a tracer for sewage contamination using a reliable enumeration method.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Bivalve distribution in hydrographic regions in South America: historical overview and conservation
AN  - 1531588135
AB  - Issue Title: Biology and Conservation of Freshwater Bivalves

              
Based on literature review and malacological collections, 168 native freshwater bivalve and five invasive species have been recorded for 52 hydrographic regions in South America. The higher species richness has been detected in the South Atlantic, Uruguay, Paraguay, and Amazon Brazilian hydrographic regions. Presence or absence data were analysed by Principal Coordinate for Phylogeny-Weighted. The lineage Veneroida was more representative in hydrographic regions that are poorer in species and located West of South America. The Mycetopodidae and Hyriidae lineages were predominant in regions that are richest in species toward the East of the continent. The distribution of invasive species Limnoperna fortunei is not related to species richness in different hydrographic regions there. The species richness and its distribution patterns are closely associated with the geological history of the continent. The hydrographic regions present distinct phylogenetic and species composition regardless of the level of richness. Therefore, not only should the richness be considered to be a criterion for prioritizing areas for conservation, but also the phylogenetic diversity of communities engaged in services and functional aspects relevant to ecosystem maintenance. A plan to the management of this fauna according to particular ecological characteristics and human uses of hydrographic regions is needed.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - A field study of the relationship between sulfide-bound metals and bioaccumulation by Limnodrilus sp. in a heavily polluted river
AN  - 1537544596; 24700206
AB  - Acid volatile sulfide (AVS) has been regarded as an important factor controlling metal bioavailability in anoxic sediments, but its effect on metal accumulation under natural conditions is poorly understood. Here, a field study of the influence of AVS on metal accumulation by Limnodrilus sp. in a heavily polluted river is provided. Most of the study area was subject to anaerobic and strongly reducing conditions, and the concentration of trace metals in surface sediments was high, as were the concentration of AVS and simultaneously extracted metals (SEM; average AVS=20.3 [mu]mol g^sup -1^, average ∑SEM^sub 5^=9.42 [mu]mol g^sup -1^; ∑SEM^sub 5^ refers to the sum of SEM^sub Cd^, SEM^sub Cu^, SEM^sub Pb^, SEM^sub Ni^, and SEM^sub Zn^). Only a few species and small quantities of benthic invertebrates were found, and Limnodrilus sp. was dominant. There was no correlation between trace metal accumulation and (SEM-AVS), and in stations where (SEM-AVS) <0, the absolute value of bioaccumulation was high (average ∑BIO^sub 5^=4.07 [mu]mol g^sup -1^; ∑BIO^sub 5^ refers to the sum of BIO^sub Cd^, BIO^sub Cu^, BIO^sub Pb^, BIO^sub Ni^, and BIO^sub Zn^), indicating that there was no relationship between (SEM-AVS) and metal accumulation in Limnodrilus sp. This was likely because Limnodrilus sp. ingest sediment particles as their main food source, so pore water metals play a minor role in their bioaccumulation (BIO) of materials. However, ∑BIO^sub 5^ was significantly correlated with ∑SEM^sub 5^ (r=0.795, p<0.01), revealing that the large number of sulfide-bound metals (SEM) in sediments may play an important role in metal accumulation in Limnodrilus sp., which can assimilate sulfide-associated metals by the help of the digestive fluids in the digestive systems.

T1  - Identification of factors constraining nitrate assimilation in Lake Superior, Laurentian Great Lakes
AN  - 1516046547
AB  - Issue Title: European Large Lakes III. Large lakes under changing environmental conditions

              
Despite a well-documented rise in nitrate concentration over the past century, Lake Superior has retained an oligotrophic character. In part, this status results from physical attributes of the lake including low temperatures and prolonged isothermy, resulting in deep-mixing and light limitation which constrain primary production. Lake Superior is also phosphorus deficient which limits phytoplankton growth. We conducted large (20 l) volume factorial bioassay experiments to assess the influence of light and nutrients (P, Fe) on nitrate assimilation by a Lake Superior chlorophyte alga. Bioassays seeded with the chlorophyte yielded a strong response to light resulting in the rapid depletion of nitrate. High light resulted in higher activities of the key N-assimilation enzyme nitrate reductase (NR) and increased algal biomass compared to low light treatments. NR activity was highly correlated with rates of nitrate incorporation in bioassays and field surveys suggesting that NR occupies a critical place in nitrate metabolism. In bioassays, the addition of nutrients (P, Fe) only slightly increased the rate at which nitrate became depleted. Parallel trials using a luminescent cyanobacterial bioreporter confirmed the lack of response by added nutrients supporting light as an important factor in constraining nitrate assimilation by phytoplankton in the lake.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Potential health impact and genotoxicity analysis of drinking source water from Liuxihe Reservoir (P.R. China)

AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Assessment of Ecosystem Health and Ecotoxicology Through Chemical Analysis and Modeling; Editor: Ji-Dong Gu 

              
Water from the Liuxihe Reservoir (a source of drinking water for Guangzhou City, P. R. China) was analyzed for semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) and the results were used for a potential health impact assessment and genotoxicity test with the microalgae Euglena gracilis. The SVOCs were tested using USEPA Method 525.2, and the health risk assessment was conducted at a screening level using the hazard quotient (HQ) approach. Alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay) was used to evaluate DNA damage and determine the genotoxicity of the source water. The concentrations of the SVOCs in Liuxihe Reservoir were very low and phthalic acid esters were the main SVOCs present. The mean HQ values of pollutants were all less than one, indicating no risk. However, the lifetime carcinogenic risks (LCRs) were found to be close to the threshold of 1.00E-5. The results show that the water in the Liuxihe Reservoir might pose a potential carcinogenic risk to local residents. The highly concentrated extracts of the water samples could induce DNA damage in the microalgal cells and a dose-effect relationship was identified. These results showed that Liuxihe Reservoir water, as a source of drinking water, could pose a potential LCR to local consumers.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Relationship between periphyton biomarkers and trace metals with the responses to environment applying an integrated biomarker response index (IBR) in estuaries
AN  - 1521277897; 24781213
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Assessment of Ecosystem Health and Ecotoxicology Through Chemical Analysis and Modeling; Editor: Ji-Dong Gu 

              
Estuaries are under great anthropogenic pressure. The presence of contaminants such as trace metals, organics and organometallics in the Haihe basin, Baohai Bay China indicates a deterioration of environmental quality. In this study the ecological status of three estuaries in Haihe basin was evaluated in relation to the presence of trace metals. An integrated biomarker response index (IBR) method was applied that combined biomarker responses in natural periphyton present on surface sediment with general "stress index". Sediment samples were collected at 11 sites throughout three estuaries of Haihe basin (Luanhe, Haihe and Zhangweixin) during three seasons. The IBR values indicated that the temporal variation of biological status was autumn (3.35) < spring (3.38) < summer (4.07) (The higher the value, the worse the biological status), while the spatial variation was Zhangweixin (0.73) < Luanhe (3.31) < Haihe (6.96) in spring and autumn, and Luanhe (1.79) < Zhangweixin (3.64) < Haihe (7.69) in summer. The risk quotients of trace metals in sediment samples were calculated based on the corresponding Effects Rang Low values. The temporal variation of risk quotients was autumn (10.76) < spring (11.78) < summer (15.99), while the estuarine variation was Luanhe (8.47) < Zhangweixin (12.29) < Haihe (19.42). The IBR values and risk quotients were fitted into cubic regression equations. It is proven that the good assessment of periphyton integrated biomarker responses to biological status and contaminated risk in estuarine zones.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Hydrogen isotope discrimination in aquatic primary producers: implications for aquatic food web studies
AN  - 1507564413
AB  - Large differences in δ ^sup 2^H of primary producers between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems are used to identify subsidies, discriminate organic matter sources, and reduce uncertainty in food web studies. Previous investigations of hydrogen isotope ratios suggest there may be predictable differences between the δ ^sup 2^H of water and organic matter for different types of primary producers. We define the difference in the net isotopic discrimination between water and bulk organic matter (om) as: [Delta]^sub H^ = (δ ^sup 2^H^sub om^ - δ ^sup 2^H^sub water^) ÷ (1 + δ ^sup 2^H^sub water^ ÷ 1,000). We summarized [Delta]^sub H^ values from published literature and we measured the δ ^sup 2^H of water and primary producers in order to compare [Delta]^sub H^ among aquatic and terrestrial primary producers. Measurements were made from three water body types (lake, river, coastal lagoon) and their associated watersheds. Although we predicted a large and equivalent net isotopic discrimination for aquatic primary producers, we found considerable variability among groups of aquatic producers. Macroalgae, benthic microalgae, and phytoplankton had more negative [Delta]^sub H^ values (i.e. greater isotopic discrimination) than both aquatic macrophytes and terrestrial vegetation. The more positive δ ^sup 2^H^sub om^ and hence lower [Delta]^sub H^ of terrestrial vegetation was expected due to relative increases in the heavier isotope, deuterium, during transpiration. However, the more positive values of δ ^sup 2^H^sub om^ and relatively low [Delta]^sub H^ in aquatic macrophytes, even submerged species, was unexpected. Marine macroalgae had high variability in δ ^sup 2^H^sub om^ as a group, but low variability within distinct species. Variability among types of primary producers in δ ^sup 2^H^sub om^ and in [Delta]^sub H^ should be assessed when hydrogen is used in isotopic studies of food webs.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Silica fluxes in the inner Elbe Estuary, Germany
AN  - 1507564334
AB  - Estuaries are major pathways for silica fluxes towards the ocean and considered to be a sink for dissolved silica (DSi). However, the data basis for DSi, but also biogenic silica (BSi) fluxes through estuaries is relatively thin. To test the hypothesis, a silica budget for the inner Elbe Estuary was constructed, based on 18 cruises between 2009-2011 and historical monitoring data. A strong positive correlation between particulate organic carbon (POC) and BSi concentration was identified, allowing the reconstruction of historical BSi time series from POC monitoring data. The budget revealed that the Elbe Estuary is a source for DSi and a strong sink for BSi, contradicting the general assumption of estuaries being a sink for DSi. The Elbe River delivered 2.8 × 10^sup 9^ mol DSi a^sup -1^ and 0.9 × 10^sup 9^ mol BSi a^sup -1^ to the estuary. There, 17 % of DSi were added along the inner estuary and 88 % of BSi were lost. Estuarine tributaries represented the largest source of additional DSi to the estuarine waters, while sedimentation was the single largest sink for BSi. It was calculated that large amounts of BSi were removed permanently from the estuarine cycle by sediment dredging. As data on Si transformation in estuaries are scarce and widely underrepresented in global budgets, findings from this study are a valuable contribution, especially since the Elbe Estuary seemed to act contradictory to observed systems so far.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The effects of bioturbation by the Venus clam Cyclina sinensis on the fluxes of nutrients across the sediment-water interface in aquaculture ponds
AN  - 1502241473
AB  - A mesocosm experiment was conducted to study the effects of bioturbation by the marine bivalve Cyclina sinensis in an aquatic system and to examine how the bioactivities of this clam alter the rate at which nutrients are exchanged across the sediment-water interface. A dark incubation experiment was performed to determine the fluxes of inorganic nutrients (NH^sub 4^ ^sup +^, NO3 ^sup -^ + NO2 ^sup -^ and PO^sub 4^ ^sup 3-^), benthic chlorophyll a (Chl a), organic matter and sediment oxygen consumption (SOC) on days 1, 10, 20 and 30. C. sinensis destroyed the initial sediment surface and partially enhanced oxygen penetration into the sediment. The clam also increased the water content and volume of the oxic sediment. The analysis showed that increases in the clam density and time period produced higher fluxes of all the nutrients (NH^sub 4^ ^sup +^, NO3 ^sup -^ + NO2 ^sup -^ and PO^sub 4^ ^sup 3-^) in the bioturbated chambers compared with the control (non-bioturbated chambers). The concentration of Chl a in the sediment increased significantly at the end of the experiment (day 30) (p < 0.05). The SOC rate increased significantly with the increase in density and with the time period from day 10 to day 30 (p < 0.05). As a result, the fluxes of nutrients increased with increased SOC, producing oxygen-induced sediment mineralization. Our findings suggest that the activities of the clams could positively influence SOC and cause an increase in the fluxes of inorganic nutrients. These effects may substantially improve the primary productivity and water quality of earthen pond ecosystems.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Impacts of Climate-Related Drivers on the Benthic Nutrient Filter in a Shallow Photic Estuary
AN  - 1510371270
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Drivers of Change in Shallow Coastal Photic Systems Guest Editors:  Michael J. Kennish, Mark J. Brush, and Kenneth A. Moore

              
In shallow photic systems, the benthic filter, including microphytobenthos and denitrifiers, is important in preventing or reducing release of remineralized NH^sub 4^ ^sup +^ to the water column. Its effectiveness can be impacted by climate-related drivers, including temperature and storminess, which by increasing wind and freshwater delivery can resuspend sediment, reduce salinity and deliver nutrients, total suspended solids, and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) to coastal systems. Increases in temperature and freshwater delivery may initiate a cascade of responses affecting benthic metabolism with impacts on sediment properties, which in turn regulate nitrogen cycling processes that either sequester (via microphytobenthos), remove (via denitrification), or increase sediment nitrogen (via remineralization, nitrogen fixation, and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium). We conducted a seasonal study at shallow stations to assess the effects of freshwater inflow, temperature, wind, light, and CDOM on sediment properties, benthic metabolism, nitrogen cycling processes, and the effectiveness of the benthic filter. We also conducted a depth study to constrain seasonally varying parameters such as temperature to better assess the effects of light availability and water depth on benthic processes. Based on relationships observed between climatic drivers and response variables, we predict a reduction in the effectiveness of the benthic filter over the long term with feedbacks that will increase effluxes of N to the water column with the potential to contribute to system eutrophication. This may push shallow systems past a tipping point where trophic status moves from net autotrophy toward net heterotrophy, with new baselines characterized by degraded water quality.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Do physicochemical variables regulate the distribution of zooplankton communities in reservoirs dominated by filter-feeding carp?
AN  - 1504359693
AB  - The temporal and spatial distributions of zooplankton communities in the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Xin'anjiang Reservoir, Zhejiang, China, were investigated monthly, between 2009 and 2010. Silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and bighead carp (Aristichthys nobilis) dominated the pelagic fish community of this large, deep reservoir. Cladocerans were distributed evenly throughout the reservoir. Rotifers were mainly found in the upper reaches, while copepods tended to assemble in the lower reaches. The Pearson correlation analysis and stepwise multiple regression were used to identify the major physicochemical gradients influencing community variations. Zooplankton community distributions were influenced by water temperature, dissolved oxygen, phosphorus, nitrogen, and silicon. Excess nutrients, in particular silicon, stimulated rotifer growth. Based on these findings, it is possible to use rotifer density as a bioindicator of eutrophic status in deep reservoir ecosystems.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - An inter-basin comparison of nutrient limitation and the irradiance response of pulse-amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorescence in Lake Erie phytoplankton
AN  - 1499455086
AB  - This research examined the application of the maximum quantum efficiency (F ^sub v^/F ^sub m^) and relative electron transport rate versus irradiance curves (rETR) as a rapid, sensitive assessment of Lake Erie phytoplankton nutrient status. I evaluated the potential benefits of the variable fluorescence parameters by comparing these parameters with chemical and physiological nutrient status assays. I tested the hypothesis that F ^sub v^/F ^sub m^ and rETR curves could diagnose nutrient status in natural lake phytoplankton and be capable of discriminating which inorganic nutrient is limited temporally and spatially. F ^sub v^/F ^sub m^ was on average highest in the more eutrophic west basin (WB) and lowest in the more oligotrophic central basin (CB). According to the chemical and physiological indicators, P deficiency was most severe in the CB during summer stratification and N deficiency was strongest in the WB during isothermal conditions. Like F ^sub v^/F ^sub m^, rETR at light saturation (rETR^sub max^) and the initial slope of the rETR versus irradiance curve ([alpha]) decreased as the severity of N and P deficiency increased. Amendment with N or P stimulated increased F ^sub v^/F ^sub m^, rETR^sub max^, and [alpha] in N- and P-limited samples, respectively, and abolished the photoinhibition apparent in rETR curves of nutrient-limited samples. These results supported the view that the N and P deficiency assays, and corresponding variations of variable fluorescence parameters, were valid indicators of widely variable N and P deficiency in the phytoplankton, and could be used to provide a promising tool in determining phytoplankton nutrient status. Contrary to my hopes, it did not appear that rETR-irradiance curves could discriminate between N and P deficiency. Identification of the most limiting nutrient still demanded additional information beyond the variable fluorescence measurements.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Dinophysis Toxins: Causative Organisms, Distribution and Fate in Shellfish
AN  - 1536901278
AB  - Several Dinophysis species produce diarrhoetic toxins (okadaic acid and dinophysistoxins) and pectenotoxins, and cause gastointestinal illness, Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning (DSP), even at low cell densities (<103 cells*L-1). They are the main threat, in terms of days of harvesting bans, to aquaculture in Northern Japan, Chile, and Europe. Toxicity and toxin profiles are very variable, more between strains than species. The distribution of DSP events mirrors that of shellfish production areas that have implemented toxin regulations, otherwise misinterpreted as bacterial or viral contamination. Field observations and laboratory experiments have shown that most of the toxins produced by Dinophysis are released into the medium, raising questions about the ecological role of extracelular toxins and their potential uptake by shellfish. Shellfish contamination results from a complex balance between food selection, adsorption, species-specific enzymatic transformations, and allometric processes. Highest risk areas are those combining Dinophysis strains with high cell content of okadaates, aquaculture with predominance of mytilids (good accumulators of toxins), and consumers who frequently include mussels in their diet. Regions including pectenotoxins in their regulated phycotoxins will suffer from much longer harvesting bans and from disloyal competition with production areas where these toxins have been deregulated.

T1  - Saline rivers provide arid landscapes with a considerable amount of biochemically valuable production of chironomid (Diptera) larvae
AN  - 1459947622
AB  - Saline rivers are supposed to be 'hot spots' of high biological productivity in arid landscapes. To test this, we quantified the production of chironomid larvae, because river production is known to be transferred to arid landscapes primarily by birds fed on these larvae. In addition, we studied the potential biochemical quality of the larvae for birds based on the essential highly unsaturated fatty acid (HUFA) contents in their biomass. We studied species composition and measured production of chironomid larvae in two saline rivers (Volgograd region, Russia). We also evaluated the fatty acid composition and contents of the dominant taxa and estimated the flux of HUFA from the studied saline rivers to land via chironomid potential emergence. Average monthly production of chironomids measured for only 1 month, August, was quite comparable to annual production in some freshwater rivers. All the dominant chironomid larvae had comparatively high essential eicosapentaenoic acid contents, especially Cricotopus salinophilus, which showed the highest value, reported for Chironomidae. The monthly flux of HUFA from the studied rivers to land due to the chironomid potential emergence was roughly comparable to the global average estimation of annual water-land HUFA export via emerging insects.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Sex-specific plasticity in body phosphorus content of Hyalella amphipods
AN  - 1459947615
AB  - Understanding the evolution of sexually dimorphic traits requires knowledge of the genetic and environmental sources of variation. However, we know surprisingly little about how the sexes differ in their responses to environmental nutrient supply. Here, we investigated how phosphorus (P) availability, a key metric of eutrophication, affects body composition in each sex of two Hyalella amphipod species. We also examined whether differences in food preference and acquisition are responsible for observed variation in body P. We discovered environmentally-driven changes in body P that were dependent on both species and sex. In both species, males contained less P when raised in low-P laboratory conditions compared to high-P field environments, while females exhibited no significant differences. Importantly, this difference was greater in the species that is known to have larger sexual traits and higher growth rates. Variation in P content was not due to differences in acquisition of P because both sexes preferred high-P food and consumed it at a similar rate. Our study illuminates potentially important sex- and species-specific evolutionary consequences of rapid alterations to P availability due to cultural eutrophication.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Improving water quality communications at beaches: input from stakeholders
AN  - 1943100467
AB  - Objectives: Water quality communication practices vary widely and stakeholder input has not played a role in defining acceptable levels of risk. Although the 2012 Recreational Water Quality Criteria (RWQC) emphasize the importance of promptly notifying the public about hazardous conditions, little is known about the public's understanding of notifications, or about levels of risk deemed acceptable. We sought to address these gaps. 
Methods: A mixed methods approach was used. Focus groups (FGs) provided qualitative data regarding the understanding of surface water quality, awareness, and use, of currently available water quality information, and acceptability of risk. Intercept interviews (INTs) at recreation sites provided quantitative data. 
Results: INTs of 374 people and 15 FG sessions were conducted. Participants had limited awareness about water quality information posted at beaches, even during swim bans and advisories. Participants indicated that communication content should be current, from a trusted source, and describe health consequences. Communicating via mobile electronics should be useful for segments of the population. Risk acceptability is lower with greater outcome severity, or if children are impacted. 
Conclusions: Current water quality communications approaches must be enhanced to make notification programs more effective. Further work should build on this initial effort to evaluate risk acceptability among US beachgoers.

T1  - Age and growth in three populations of Dosinia exoleta (Bivalvia: Veneridae) from the Portuguese coast
AN  - 1459946634
AB  - The present study aimed at estimating the age and growth in three populations of Dosinia exoleta from the Portuguese coast (Aveiro in the north, Setúbal in the southwest and Faro in the south). Two techniques were compared to ascertain the most suitable method for ageing D. exoleta. Growth marks on the shell surface and acetate peel replicas of sectioned shells were the techniques applied. Two hypotheses were tested: growth parameters present latitudinal variation along the Portuguese coast; growth parameters are influenced by the fishing exploitation. Shell surface rings proved inappropriate for ageing this species, whereas acetate peels provided realistic estimates of the von Bertalanffy growth parameters (K, L ^sub ∞^ and t ^sub 0^). A latitudinal gradient in growth rate was detected, with a clear southward increase in the growth coefficient (K) of D. exoleta (Faro > Setúbal and Aveiro) indicating that warmer waters in southern Portugal provide optimal conditions for the growth of this species. Fishing exploitation in northern Portugal targets larger individuals and leaves behind a younger population of smaller individuals, decreasing the asymptotic shell length (L ^sub ∞^) of D. exoleta from Aveiro. The overall growth performance was compared among populations of D. exoleta and with other venerid species worldwide.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Bivalve Omics: State of the Art and Potential Applications for the Biomonitoring of Harmful Marine Compounds
AN  - 1535665915
AB  - The extraordinary progress experienced by sequencing technologies and bioinformatics has made the development of omic studies virtually ubiquitous in all fields of life sciences nowadays. However, scientific attention has been quite unevenly distributed throughout the different branches of the tree of life, leaving molluscs, one of the most diverse animal groups, relatively unexplored and without representation within the narrow collection of well established model organisms. Within this Phylum, bivalve molluscs play a fundamental role in the functioning of the marine ecosystem, constitute very valuable commercial resources in aquaculture, and have been widely used as sentinel organisms in the biomonitoring of marine pollution. Yet, it has only been very recently that this complex group of organisms became a preferential subject for omic studies, posing new challenges for their integrative characterization. The present contribution aims to give a detailed insight into the state of the art of the omic studies and functional information analysis of bivalve molluscs, providing a timely perspective on the available data resources and on the current and prospective applications for the biomonitoring of harmful marine compounds.

T1  - Origin identification method by multiple trace elemental analysis of short-neck clams produced in Japan, China, and the Republic of Korea
AN  - 1458215613
AB  - The correlations among the contents of trace elements in the shells of short-neck clams collected from Japan, China, and the Republic of Korea were examined. Origin-specific elemental content patterns were seen in clams originating from Japan, China, and the Republic of Korea. The crushed shells were decomposed with nitric acid-hydrogen peroxide, and the concentrations of ten elements (Li, V, Mn, Co, As, Rb, Mo, Ba, Pb, and U) in the shells were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Some of the metal concentrations in the samples displayed clear geographical trends. The average concentration of Pb in Japanese clam shells was one-half to one-quarter that seen in Chinese or Korean clams. Average concentrations of As, Rb, and Ba in shells of Japanese origin were one-half those observed in Chinese or Korean clams. Linear discriminant analysis was applied to these analytical data, and four discriminant models were constructed. These discriminant models were able to distinguish the geographic origins of short-neck clams with 80.0-100 % accuracy. In particular, clams of Japanese origin were classified correctly >=90 % of the time. Therefore, the trace elemental analysis of a short-neck clam shell is useful for identifying the country of origin of the clam.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Genetic diversity and population structure of Eleutheronema rhadinum in the East and South China Seas revealed in mitochondrial COI sequences
AN  - 1448791475
AB  - Eleutheronema rhadinum is a potential commercial fisheries species and is subject to intense exploitation in China. Knowledge on the population structure of E. rhadinum in Chinese coastal waters, which is important for sustainable exploitation and proper resource management, is lacking. In the present study, the genetic diversity and population structure of E. rhadinum were evaluated using a 564-base pair fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene. A total of 76 specimens were collected from three localities around the East (Qidong and Zhoushan) and South China Seas (Zhuhai). Among these individuals, nine polymorphic sites were detected and 11 distinct haplotypes were defined. High levels of haplotype diversity (h =0.759±0.035) and low levels of nucleotide diversity ([pi]= 0.001 98±0.003 26) were observed in these populations. Hierarchical analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicated that 96.72% of the genetic variation occurred within the populations, whereas 3.28% occurred among populations. No significant genealogical branches or clusters were recognized on the neighbor-joining tree. Intra-group variation among populations was significant ([phi] ^sub st^=0.032 85, P<0.01). These results suggest that E. rhadinum populations in the East and South China Seas have developed divergent genetic structures. Tests of neutral evolution and mismatch distribution suggest that E. rhadinum may have experienced a population expansion. The present study provides basic information for the conservation and sustainable exploitation of this species.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Toxic effects of Triclosan on the detoxification system and breeding of Daphnia magna
AN  - 1441486764; 24022518
AB  - The toxic effects of different concentrations of Triclosan (TCS) (1-128 [mu]g/L) on Daphnia magna (D. magna) were investigated by acute (48 h) and chronic (21-day) toxicity tests. The response of antioxidase system and Phase I metabolism process of D. magna exposed to TCS were investigated by measuring a series of biomarkers including glutathione S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD), Erythromycin N-demethylase (ERND) and Aminopyrine N-demethylase (APND). The 48 h LC^sub 50^ of TCS was 330 [mu]g/L for D. magna. In the chronic test, total number of neonates per female, body length and the intrinsic rate of natural increase (r) of D. magna increased at the low exposure concentrations (1-16 [mu]g/L) and decreased at the high concentrations (64-128 [mu]g/L), while the total number of molting per adult decreased continually. The GST and CAT activities showed no significant increase in all treatments, and SOD activities were induced after 24-h exposure and inhibited after 48-h exposure at 4-128 [mu]g/L of concentrations. The MDA content increased after 6-h exposure but decreased after 48-h exposure at 4-128 [mu]g/L. EROD activities initially increased after 6-h exposure, but decreased after 24 and 48-h exposure, ERND and APND activities showed a similar temporal pattern among different treatments groups. SOD, MDA and APND were sensitive to TCS, thus they are suitable as potential biomarkers for the exposure to TCS.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Ecological Risks Assessment and Pollution Source Identification of Trace Elements in Contaminated Sediments from the Pearl River Delta, China
AN  - 1437332522; 23975580
AB  - Sediments from 14 stations in the Foshan Waterway, a river crossing the industrial district of Guangdong Province, South China, were sampled and subsequently analyzed. The 14 stations were selected for the pollution discharging features of the river, such as the hydrology, the distribution of pollution sources, and the locations of wastewater outlets. The ecological risks were assessed, and the pollution sources were identified to provide valuable information for environmental impact assessment and pollution control. The spatial variability was high and the range were (in milligrams per kilogram dry weight): Pb, 46.0~382.8; Cu, 33.7~ 482.3; Zn, 62.2~1,568.7; Ni, 28.5~130.7; Cr, 34.7~1,656.1; Cd, 0.50~8.53; Hg, 0.02~8.27; and As, 5.77~66.09. The evaluation results of enrichment factor and potential ecological risk index indicate that the metal pollution in the surface and bottom sediments were severely polluted and could pose serious threat to the ecosystem in most stations. Although the hazard levels of the trace element differed among the stations, Hg was the most serious pollutant in all stations. The results of principal component analysis (PCA) show that the discharge of industrial wastewater is the most important polluting factor whereas domestic sewage, which contains a large amount of organic substances, accelerates metal deposition. And potential pollution sources were identified by the way of integrating the analysis results of PCA and data gained from the local government. Therefore, the conclusion is drawn that Foshan Waterway is seriously polluted with trace elements, both in the surface sediment (0 to 20 cm) and the bottom sediments (21 to 50 cm) are contaminated.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Long-term trends and causal factors associated with Microcystis abundance and toxicity in San Francisco Estuary and implications for climate change impacts
AN  - 1433788882
AB  - The impacts of climate change on Microcystis blooms in San Francisco Estuary are uncertain because factors associated with the abundance and distribution of Microcystis blooms since their inception in 1999 are poorly understood. Discrete and continuous data collected between 2004 and 2008 were used to assess what factors controlled bloom initiation and persistence, if there was an impact of the bloom on mesozooplankton abundance and toxicity or dissolved organic carbon concentration, and how these might vary with climate change. Microcystis abundance was greater in dry years than wet years and both total microcystins concentration and the microcystins content of mesozooplankton tissue increased with abundance. The bloom began in the upstream portions of the estuary and spread farther west during dry years. Bloom initiation required water temperature above 19°C and surface irradiance in the visible range above 100 W m^sup -2^. The bloom persisted during a wide range of water quality conditions but was closely correlated with low turbidity. The intensity of Microcystis blooms will likely increase with climate change due to increased water temperature and low streamflow during droughts. Elevated water temperature earlier in the spring could also extend the duration of Microcystis blooms by up to 3 months.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Harmful and parasitic unicellular eukaryotes persist in a shallow lake under reconstruction (L. Karla, Greece)
AN  - 1433788849
AB  - The reconstructed Lake Karla, Greece, has been undergoing its water-filling period since November 2009. In this paper, we aimed at investigating whether the unicellular eukaryotes, including the toxic/parasitic ones, that have been found during mass fish kills in the lake (March-April 2010), persist during the first warm period of the lake (May, August, November 2010). Given that microscopic characterization of some of these eukaryotes is not adequate for their identification, we analysed the 18S rRNA gene diversity of plankton samples. All the found phylotypes belonged to the phyla of Mesomycetazoa, Chlorophyta, Fungi, Alveolata, Cercozoa, Cryptophyta and Stramenopiles. Some members of these groups seem to persist in Lake Karla as they have been found in early spring as well. These microscopic eukaryotes are either ichthyotoxic/parasitic (e.g. Pfiesteria sp./Pseudopfiesteria shumwayae, some Fungi, Mesomycetazoa, Lagenidium sp., Cercozoa) or indicative of hyper-eutrophic conditions (e.g. Oocystis sp., Scenedesmus spp.) and were rather abundant during the first spring-autumn period of the lake's refilling process. These complex microscopic communities are expected to shape highly dynamic and variable food webs with the risk of repeated fish kills.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Implications of water column ammonium uptake and regeneration for the nitrogen budget in temperate, eutrophic Missisquoi Bay, Lake Champlain (Canada/USA)
AN  - 1433787903
AB  - Assessing ammonium (NH^sub 4^ ^sup +^) availability in aquatic systems requires accurate concentration and turnover rate data. Water column NH^sub 4^ ^sup +^ regeneration, potential NH^sub 4^ ^sup +^ uptake, and nitrogen (N) fixation rates were measured in Missisquoi Bay, Lake Champlain, to help constrain internal N dynamics affecting phytoplankton community structure and cyanobacteria (Cy) blooms. Cyanobacteria dominated phytoplankton biomass during occasional summer bloom periods, but low or undetectable N2 fixation rates and low heterocyte abundances suggested that N fixing cyanobacteria did not rely on atmospheric N2. Light/dark incubations revealed that photosynthetic and dark NH^sub 4^ ^sup +^ uptake generally were balanced, highlighting the importance of bacterial uptake. Our results suggest that phytoplankton were not controlled by nutrients from the "bottom-up"; rather, water column N dynamics responded to phytoplankton patterns. Basin-scale water column NH^sub 4^ ^sup +^ regeneration rates were about 700,000 mol N day^sup -1^ (9.8 t N day^sup -1^), which is almost twice the estimated N load from tributaries, and suggests a primary role for water column N regeneration in supporting primary production. Comparisons of basin-scale NH^sub 4^ ^sup +^ regeneration and demand imply that primary production is not sustained fully by combined water column regeneration and tributary N inputs; thus, future research should constrain additional sources and sinks affecting N balance in this and other aquatic systems.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Accumulation and biochemical effects of microcystin-LR on the Patagonian pejerrey (Odontesthes hatcheri) fed with the toxic cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa
AN  - 1433078055; 23504082
AB  - We studied accumulation and biochemical effects of microcystin-LR (MCLR) in Odontesthes hatcheri after dietary administration of the cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa (1.3 [mu]g MCLR/g body mass, incorporated in standard fish food). After 12 h, MCLR content in liver did not differ between fish fed with crushed or intact cells, demonstrating O. hatcheri's capacity to digest cyanobacteria and absorb MCLR. In the second experiment, fish received toxic cells, non-toxic cells, or control food; MCLR accumulation was monitored for 48 h. Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), catalase (CAT), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities, and lipid peroxidation (as MDA) were measured in liver and intestine. Methanol-extractable MCLR was determined by PP1 inhibition assay (PPIA); extractable and protein-bound MCLR were measured by Lemieux oxidation-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). MCLR accumulated rapidly up to 22.9 and 9.4 [mu]g MCLR/g in intestine and liver, respectively, followed by a decreasing tendency. Protein-bound MCLR represented 66 to ca. 100 % of total MCLR in both tissues. PP1 activity remained unchanged in intestine but was increased in liver of MCLR treated fish.CAT and GST activities and MDA content were significantly increased by MCLR only in liver. We conclude that O. hatcheri is able to digest cyanobacteria, accumulating MCLR mostly bound to proteins. Our data suggest that this freshwater fish can be adversely affected by cyanobacterial blooms. However, the rapid decrease of the detectable MCLR in both tissues could imply that sublethal toxin accumulation is rapidly reversed.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Climate change in arid lands and Native American socioeconomic vulnerability: The case of the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe
AN  - 1433065680
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Climate Change and Indigenous Peoples in the United States: Impacts, Experiences and Actions              The case of the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe exemplifies tribal vulnerabilities as a result of climate change. Preliminary socio-economic data and analysis reveal that the tribe's vulnerability to climate change is related to cultural and economic dependence on Pyramid Lake, while external socio-economic vulnerability factors influence adaptive capacity and amplify potential impacts. Reduced water supplies as a consequence of climate change would result in a compounded reduction of inflows to Pyramid Lake, thus potentially impacting the spawning and sustenance of a cultural livelihood, the endangered cui-ui fish (Chasmistes cujus). Meanwhile, limited economic opportunities and dwindling federal support constrain tribal adaptive capacity. Factors that contribute to tribal adaptive capacity include: sustainability-based values, technical capacity for natural resource management, proactive initiatives for the control of invasive-species, strong external scientific networks, and remarkable tribal awareness of climate change.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Morphological and molecular analyses of larval trematodes in the intertidal bivalve Perumytilus purpuratus from central Chile
AN  - 1448829520; 22989669
AB  - Abstract

              
The bivalve Perumytilus purpuratus is a common species that is widely distributed throughout rocky intertidal zones in Chile. This bivalve is the first intermediate host for three trematode species: one bucephalid (an undetermined species) and two fellodistomids (Proctoeces lintoni and one undetermined species). A few studies based on morphological comparisons, experimental infection and molecular analyses have been performed to ascertain the taxon (at least at the family level) to which these trematodes belong; yet, there remains no clarification about the specific identity of these trematodes. Therefore, in this study, we compared the V4 region nucleotide sequences of the 18S rRNA of these three sporocyst species, classified as morphotypes, found in P. purpuratus and nine adult trematode species from intertidal fishes that are likely definitive hosts for these parasites. The sequences from two of the sporocyst morphotypes matched with adult trematodes from the intertidal fish: type 1 sporocyst was similar to Prosorhynchoides carvajali (Bucephalidae), with a mean genetic divergence of 0.78%, and type 2 sporocyst was similar to Proctoeces sp. (but not P. lintoni), with 0% genetic divergence. The third species (type 3 sporocyst) was classified to the family Fellodistomidae; however, the sequence from this species differed greatly from the three other fellodistomid species documented in the marine fish of Chile and from other fellodistomids in public databases. Moreover, this morphotype has a particular cercarial morphology that greatly differs from other fellodistomid species described thus far. Therefore, this intriguing trematode remains a mystery.

T1  - Oxidative stress biomarkers in freshwater fish Carassius auratus exposed to decabromodiphenyl ether and ethane, or their mixture
AN  - 1426492424; 23839511
AB  - Decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-209) and its commercial alternative decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE) are two structurally similar brominated flame retardants, with evidence of their ubiquitous existence in aquatic ecosystems. The present study was conducted to investigate the hepatic oxidative stress inducing potential of BDE-209, DBDPE, and their mixture in Carassius auratus after exposure to different doses (10, 50 and 100 mg/kg) for 7, 14 and 30 days. Results showed that oxidative stress was evoked evidently for the experimental groups with longer exposure duration, as indicated by significant inhibition in the antioxidant enzymes activities and decrease in the reduced glutathione level, as well as simultaneous elevation of lipid peroxidation level measured by malondialdehyde content. In addition, it was found that BDE-209 possessed a higher oxidative stress inducing ability than DBDPE. Considering the more pronounced antioxidant responses in combined exposure, the interaction of BDE-209 and DBDPE was presumed to be additive action.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Impact of temperature and species interaction on filamentous cyanobacteria may be more important than salinity and increased pCO2 levels
AN  - 1418352054
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Acidification

              
A future business-as-usual scenario (A1FI) was tested on two bloom-forming cyanobacteria of the Baltic Proper, Nodularia spumigena and Aphanizomenon sp., growing separately and together. The projected scenario was tested in two laboratory experiments where (a) interactive effects of increased temperature and decreased salinity and (b) interactive effects of increased temperature and elevated levels of pCO2 were tested. Increased temperature, from 12 to 16 °C, had a positive effect on the biovolume and photosynthetic activity (F ^sub v^/F ^sub m^) of both species. Compared when growing separately, the biovolume of each species was lower when grown together. Decreased salinity, from 7 to 4, and elevated levels of pCO2, from 380 to 960 ppm, had no effect on the biovolume, but on F ^sub v^/F ^sub m^ of N. spumigena with higher F ^sub v^/F ^sub m^ in salinity 7. Our results suggest that the projected A1FI scenario might be beneficial for the two species dominating the extensive summer blooms in the Baltic Proper. However, our results further stress the importance of studying interactions between species.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Linking sub-individual and population level toxicity effects in Daphnia schoedleri (Cladocera: Anomopoda) exposed to sublethal concentrations of the pesticide [alpha]-cypermethrin
AN  - 1403472912; 23661095
AB  - Synthetic pyrethroids are classified as moderately toxic to mammals and birds; nevertheless, they are highly toxic to non-target aquatic organisms such as fish and zooplankters. Chemical pollutants produce different effects in exposed organisms, ranging from biochemical to population responses. Cladocerans can modify the energy content of their offspring according to the surrounding medium as a way to improve their odds in case they have to cope with stressful conditions at birth. In this study, the effect of a synthetic pesticide on two levels of response in a Daphnia species different from those traditionally used as test organisms was evaluated. With this aim, Daphnia schoedleri neonates (<24 h) were exposed for 21 days to three sublethal concentrations of [alpha]-cypermethrin, 0.54, 5.4, and 54 ng L^sup -1^, which correspond to 48-h EC^sub 1^/100, EC^sub 1^/10, and EC^sub 1^, respectively. Effects were measured through a life table analysis for fecundity and survivorship. For effects on progeny, protein, carbohydrates, and lipids were determined and then transformed to caloric content. Biomarkers (BM) were expected to be the most sensitive evaluated response; nevertheless, population parameters such as survivorship and net reproductive rate (R^sub 0^) were more sensitive since they presented significant differences with respect to controls at the lowest tested concentration. Neonates' caloric content varied during the reproductive period assessed and was negatively correlated to fecundity: as more neonates were born, less energy was provided by the adult females. Macromolecules concentration and caloric content values in cypermethrin-exposed adults were not different from those recorded in the control at the end of exposure time. The results herein presented suggest that stressed daphnids allocate more energy reserves to their offspring, although this strategy can vary depending on the number of reproductive events during the lifecycle, and on the toxicant's concentration. Sub-individual approaches to assess toxicant effects should be accompanied by demographic studies, which support population effect predictions inferred from BMs assessment.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Ameliorating effect of [beta]-carotene on antioxidant response and hematological parameters of mercuric chloride toxicity in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus)
AN  - 1380369750; 23475564
AB  - The impact of different levels of dietary [beta]-carotene to alleviate the effect of mercuric chloride toxicity in Nile tilapia was assessed. Semi-purified diets containing 0, 40, and 100 mg [beta]-carotene kg^sup -1^ dry diet were fed for 21 days, which were subjected to sublethal concentration of mercuric chloride (0.05 ppm). Hematological and biochemical parameters, lipid profile, and antioxidant response were examined. All hematological parameters of tilapia fish starting from second week of toxicity were significantly decreased. A significant increasing trend in liver enzymes (ALT and AST) were observed parallel to the time of toxicity and peroxide radicals (MDA) appearing significantly increased in toxicated group without carotene supplement, although carotene supplementation return all parameters within the control levels. Mercury accumulated significantly in fish liver and white muscles in toxicated group while it showed a significant reduction in dietary [beta]-carotene-treated group. Overall, it can be used as immunostimulant and alleviate the suppression effect resulted from immune depressive stressful condition in farmed Nile tilapia.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Clearance rates and ingestion efficiency of the Japanese scallop Patinopecten yessoensis
AN  - 1618955864
AB  - In coastal ecosystems, variations in food quantity may have significant effects on the clearance and ingestion rates of suspension-feeding bivalves. In this study, clearance rates and ingestion efficiencies were determined for Japanese scallop (Patinopecten yessoensis) juveniles (60.6±4.5 mm in shell height) under laboratory conditions. Scallops were kept individually in glass beakers at 15°C and fed with different cell numbers of Pavlova sp. (0.8 to 57.60×106 cells) to provide a wide range of food quantity as particulate organic carbon (POC). Clearance rates (CR) and ingestion efficiencies (IE) were estimated by monitoring POC concentration over a two-day period, and from 2 to 14 days of feeding, respectively. Both CR and IE were significantly influenced by POC concentration. CR ranged from 15.8 to 38.5 mL ind-1 h-1 (or 8.9 to 49.6 mg Ch-1 g dry weight-1) with maximum values at high POC concentrations. IE varied from 40 to 71% and differed significantly between the lowest (2,900 ?g C L-1) and highest (8,000 ?g C L-1) food rations. The feeding response of juvenile scallops to different POC concentrations was fitted to a power curve equation: IE (%)=0.9272×POC0.5105, r=0.98. Extrapolated field-based estimates of IE ranged from 7.8 to 12.7% in response to seasonal changes in POC concentration (64.5 to 168.6 ?g C L-1). It is concluded that particle filtration rates by juvenile scallops are related to food quantity, as suggested by both field and laboratory-derived feeding rates.

T1  - Diversidade de moluscos em riachos de uma região de encosta no extremo sul do Brasil/Diversity of mollusks in streams of a montane region in southern Brazil
AN  - 1462525929
AB  - Stream mollusks in a region of slope in southern Brazil (Toropi River Basin) were inventoried by means of collections conducted in 40 sites, in altitudes ranging from 70 to 500 meters. At a whole, 18 species were found, represented predominantly by gastropods (11 species, 89.5% of the individuals). Potamolithus catharinae and Uncancylus concentrions were the dominant species. The latter was also well distributed, occurring in 81% of the sampling sites. Among the bivalves, only the invasive Asian clam Corbicula fluminea was abundant, but it occurred in only one sampling site. Four species were rare, being represented by less than three individuals, and the Unionoida were represented by two species only. Dominance and diversity of gastropods were higher than the bivalves, reflecting the gravel substrate of stream beds in the Toropi River Basin. The low richness recorded in the area studied is related to paucity of fine sediments and macrophytes in the streams, factors that commonly favors mollusks diversity. This condition also characterizes other southern Brazilian streams. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Reduction of zooplankton communities in small lake outlets in relation to abiotic and biotic factors
AN  - 1367463581
AB  - The aim of this study was to answer the following questions: (1) which environmental variables, biotic (fish predation) or abiotic factors, have a greater influence on the rate of zooplankton changes in lake outlet sections and (2) which plankters suffer the greatest reduction in the outlet section.

              
Samples were collected in two locations at each of 18 lakes. The first site was right at the outflow; the second site was 0.2 km downstream from the outflow. At downstream sites the percentage contribution of Rotifera in zooplankton species number and abundance was higher than in the outflow, whilst the percentage contribution of Cladocera and Copepoda (except nauplii) in the zooplankton species number and abundance was lower at downstream sites than in outlets. The most important variables affecting the rate of zooplankton reduction in the lake outlets are the biomass of cyprinids and hydrological parameters along the outlet, such as discharge, current velocity, and depth.

              
The most dramatic reductions involved daphnids, adult copepods, small cladocerans, and copepodites, while the reduction in the abundance of rotifers and nauplii was statistically insignificant.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Beta-glucan: an ideal immunostimulant in aquaculture (a review)
AN  - 1356806140; 22965949
AB  - The major hindrance in the development and sustainability of aquaculture industry is the occurrence of various diseases in the farming systems. Today, preventive and management measures are central concern to overcome such outbreak of diseases. Immunostimulants are considered as an effective tool for enhancing immune status of cultured organisms. Among different immunostimulants used in aquaculture practices, [beta]-glucan is one of the promising immunostimulant, which is a homopolysaccharide of glucose molecule linked by the glycoside bond. It forms the major constituents of cell wall of some plants, fungi, bacteria, mushroom, yeast, and seaweeds. Major attention on [beta]-glucan was captivated with the gain in knowledge on its receptors and the mechanism of action. The receptor present inside the animal body recognizes and binds to [beta]-glucan, which in turn renders the animal with high resistance and enhanced immune response. This review highlights [beta]-glucan as an immunostimulant, its effective dosages, and route of administration and furthermore provides an outline on role of [beta]-glucan in enhancing growth, survival, and protection against infectious pathogens pertaining to fishes and shellfishes. Study also summarizes the effect of [beta]-glucan on its receptors, recognition of proteins, immune-related enzymes, immune-related gene expression and their mechanisms of action.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Effects of predator exclusion on recruit survivorship in an octocoral (Briareum asbestinum) and a scleractinian coral (Porites astreoides)
AN  - 1348136327
AB  - Recruits of the Caribbean scleractinian coral Porites astreoides and the octocoral Briareum asbestinum were established on artificial substrata and reared on a reef in cages designed to exclude various classes of organisms known to feed on corals. Post-settlement survivorship of recruits was measured for periods of 2Â weeks (B. asbestinum) and 1Â month (P. astreoides) on East Turtle Reef in the Florida Keys during May and June 2010. Predator exclusion did not affect survivorship among P. astreoides recruits during the study. Recruits of B. asbestinum experienced lower survivorship in treatments that allowed access by fish compared with fish exclusion treatments. The results indicate that predation may be an important determinant of post-settlement mortality among B. asbestinum recruits, and fishes are the primary contributors to predation-induced mortality. B. asbestinum recruit survivorship differed by an order of magnitude between recruits in the control condition and those in the predator exclusion (0.087 and 0.372, respectively). The findings illustrate the need to consider the effects of interactions early in life on the survival, propagation, and recovery of coral populations.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Real-time monitoring of water quality using fish and crayfish as bio-indicators: a review
AN  - 1347642554; 23054288
AB  - Water quality monitoring using fish and crayfish as bio-indicators requires an understanding of the state of pollution of waters, choice of bio-indicators, physiological and behavioral endpoints of fish and crayfish, and principles of the methodology and their potential applications. Here, we discuss telemetry, acoustic monitoring, vision-based monitoring, measures of ventilatory activity, electrocardiography, and fiber-optic plethysmography. Assessment of water quality must be based, not only on physicochemical characteristics of the current environment as determined by chemical analyses, but also on observations of the physiology and behavior of its inhabitants. Real-time biomonitoring is suggested as the most reliable method, since it incorporates living organisms into the system to serve as biosensors. The potential application of the methods discussed includes use at water treatment plants and water supply stations for prevention of hazardous toxicological events, and, for aquaculture, in ponds, lakes, and aquariums for monitoring growth, population size, and behavior traits.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - A comparison of the palaeolimnology of Peipsi and Võrtsjärv: connected shallow lakes in north-eastern Europe for the twentieth century, especially in relation to eutrophication progression and water-level fluctuations
AN  - 1335103819
AB  - Issue Title: Conservation, management and restoration of shallow lake ecosystems facing multiple stressors

              
We applied a multi-proxy palaeolimnological approach to provide insights into the natural variability and human-mediated trends of two interconnected temperate large shallow lakes, Peipsi and Võrtsjärv, during the twentieth century. The history of the lakes was assessed on the basis of age-related changes in the sediment main constituents (water, organic matter and carbonate), sub-fossil pigments, diatom assemblages and organic matter dissolved in pore water. The temporal changes in the palaeodata indicate an increase of the in-lake biological production in both lakes from about the 1960s, suggesting enhanced nutrient inputs. In subsequent decades, the gradual increase of autochthonous organic matter becomes more obvious, indicating progressive eutrophication of the lakes. Palaeolimnological indicators from the sediment record of Lake Peipsi indicate a slight recession of the lakeâ[euro](TM)s eutrophication in the 1990s but not for Lake Võrtsjärv. The results of the study also suggest that after the lakes became eutrophied, the climatically induced water-level fluctuations ceased to be the main driver determining the abundance of phytoplankton. Responses of the lakes to human-induced impacts are better recorded in the sediments of Lake Peipsi than in those of Lake Võrtsjärv, which is shallower of the two and where the wave-induced resuspension of deposits markedly smooths or erases the signals of environmental changes. The results of the investigation expand the knowledge on how large shallow lakes respond to human-mediated and natural perturbations, including those in the lake catchment areas and the capability of the lakes to store the chronology and sequence of these changes.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Bioaccumulation of HCH isomers in selected macroinvertebrates from the Elbe River: sources and environmental implications
AN  - 1364640144; 22983615
AB  - Sediments of the Elbe River have been extremely polluted by contaminants originating from previous large-scale hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) production and the application of γ-HCH (lindane) in its catchment in the second half of the twentieth century. In order to gain knowledge on bioaccumulation processes at lower trophic levels, field investigations of HCHs in macroinvertebrates were carried out along the longitudinal profile of the Elbe and tributary. Among the sites studied, concentrations in macroinvertebrates ranged within five orders of magnitude (0.01-100 [mu]g/kg). In general, lower values of HCH isomers were observed at all Czech sites (mostly <1 [mu]g/kg) compared with those in Germany. At the most contaminated site, Spittelwasser brook (a tributary of the Mulde), extremely high concentrations were measured (up to 234 [mu]g/kg [alpha]-HCH and 587 [mu]g/kg [beta]-HCH in Hydropsychidae). In contrast, the Obríství site, though also influenced by HCH production facilities, showed only negligibly elevated values (mostly <1 [mu]g/kg). Results showed that fairly high levels of [alpha]-HCH and [beta]-HCH compared to γ-HCH can still be detected in aquatic environments of the Elbe catchment, and these concentrations are decreasing over time to a lesser extent than γ-HCH. Higher HCH concentrations in sediments in the springtime are considered to be the result of erosion and transport processes during and after spring floods, and lower concentrations at sites downstream are thought to be caused by the time lapse involved in the transportation of contaminated particles from upstream. In addition, comparison with fish (bream) data from the literature revealed no increase in tissue concentrations between invertebrates and fish.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Molecular cloning, characterization and expression profiles of thioredoxin 1 and thioredoxin 2 genes in Mytilus galloprovincialis
AN  - 1357221814
AB  - Thioredoxin (Trx) proteins are involved in many biological processes especially the regulation of cellular redox homeostasis. In this study, two Trx cDNAs were cloned from the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis using rapid amplifi cation of cDNA ends-polymerase chain reaction (RACE-PCR). The two cDNAs were named MgTrx1 and MgTrx2, respectively. The open reading frames of MgTrx1 and MgTrx2 were 318 and 507 base pairs (bp) and they encoded proteins of 105 and 168 amino acids with estimated molecular masses of 11.45 and 18.93 kDa, respectively. Sequence analysis revealed that both proteins possessed the conserved active site dithiol motif Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys. In addition, MgTrx2 also possessed a putative mitochondrial targeting signal suggesting that it is located in the mitochondria. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) revealed that both MgTrx1 and MgTrx2 were constitutively expressed in all tissues examined. The MgTrx1 transcript was most abundant in hemocytes and gills, whereas the MgTrx2 transcript was most abundant in gonad, hepatopancreas, gill and hemocytes. Following Vibrio anguillarum challenge, the expression of MgTrx1 was up-regulated and reached its peak, at a value 10-fold the initial value, at 24 h. Subsequently, expression returned back to the original level. In contrast, the expression level of MgTrx2 was down-regulated following bacterial stimulation, with one fi fth of the control level evident at 12 h post challenge. These results suggest that MgTrx1 and MgTrx2 may play important roles in the response of M. galloprovincialis to bacterial challenge.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Arsenic speciation and spatial and interspecies differences of metal concentrations in mollusks and crustaceans from a South China estuary
AN  - 1328380008; 23475307
AB  - Arsenic speciation and concentrations were determined in mollusks and crustaceans in the intertidal zone from twelve locations in Zhanjiang estuary, South China. Metal concentrations (Ag, As, Cd, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, and Zn) were also concurrently determined in these species. Arsenic speciation analysis showed that the less-toxic arsenobetaine (AsB) constituted 80.6â[euro]"98.8Â % of all As compounds, and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) constituted 0.47â[euro]"3.44Â %. Monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) and As(V) were only detected in the whelk Drupa fiscella and the crab Heteropilumnus ciliatus, respectively. Arsenite [As(III)] was not detected in any of the sampled specimens, but there were also unidentified other As species. A strong spatial variation of metals in the oyster Saccostrea cucullata was found in the estuary, confirming that oysters can be used as a good biomonitor of metal contamination in the studied area. The concentrations of eight metals in the studied mollusks and crustaceans clearly revealed that these invertebrates accumulated different metals to different degrees. Furthermore, As, Cd, Cu, Hg, and Pb contents in mollusks and crustacean samples were below the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) safe concentrations, thus there was no obvious health risk from the intake of the metals through marine mollusks and crustaceans consumption.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Impact of tributary DOM and nutrient inputs on the nearshore ecology of a large, oligotrophic lake (Georgian Bay, Lake Huron, Canada)
AN  - 1318837686
AB  - Two adjacent bays in a large oligotrophic lake (Georgian Bay, Lake Huron) were compared to determine how the inputs from relatively pristine, but moderately humic, tributaries may influence phytoplankton, nutrients and system metabolism. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations decreased from 4 to 5 gC m^sup -3^ at inner sites to 2 gC m^sup -3^ or less at outer sites. The concentration gradient from inner to outer was greater in the bay with a major tributary, and optical properties (intensity and slope of light absorption spectrum) showed there was a loss of material with allochthonous characteristics along the gradient. Chlorophyll a (Chl a) and total phosphorus (TP) were also higher at inner (2-4 mg Chl a m^sup -3^ and 8-12 mgP m^sup -3^, respectively) than outer sites (<=1 mg Chl a m^sup -3^ and 4-5 mgP m^sup -3^). Chl a and TP, as well as particulate nutrient ratios (C:P, C:N, N:P), indicated significant eutrophication at inner sites, especially in the bay with the tributary, and there was a strong positive Chl a-phosphorus relationship. The stable oxygen isotope ratio (^sup 18^O:^sup 16^O) of dissolved oxygen indicated greater influence of biological oxygen fluxes at inner sites (where ratios were 2-3 ppt below atmospheric equilibrium) than at outer sites (where ratios were within 0.5 ppt of equilibrium). Community photosynthesis:respiration ratios inferred from ^sup 18^O:^sup 16^O varied positively with Chl a and inorganic nutrients, but negatively with DOC. Altered loading of allochthonous organic matter can be expected under changing climate and development scenarios and will have significant influence on optical properties and system metabolism through changes in DOC in this coastal system. The effects will nonetheless be strongly modulated by any accompanying change in inorganic nutrients.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AN  - 1317137558; 23354932
AB  - Cyanobacteria have often been described as nutritionally poor for herbivorous organisms. To gain additional information on the potential impacts of invertebrates feeding on cyanobacteria, we fed Elliptio complanata mussels with two types of algae: Anabaena flos-aquae (cyanobacteria) and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata (green algae). Physiological parameters were examined at the energy status, immune system and oxidative stress levels. Energy status was examined by following the rate of electron transport activity in mitochondria (a measure of cellular energy expense) and lipid/sugar stores in the visceral mass. The cyanobacteria were not actively producing toxins. Based on the digestive gland index, the mussels fed equally on either regime. However, the energy status in mussels fed A. flos-aquae revealed that the total sugar was lower in the digestive gland, whereas mitochondrial electron transport activity (MET), once corrected against the digestive gland somatic index, showed increased energy expenses. Acetylcholinesterase activity and lipid peroxidation (LPO) were also higher in mussels fed with A. flos-aquae compared with mussels fed with P. subcapitata. LPO was correlated by mitochondrial activity in both the digestive gland and gills, suggesting that oxidative stress resulted from metabolic respiration. Immunocompetence (phagocytic activity, natural killer cell-like activity, haemocyte count and viability) and humoral level of lysozyme were not affected in mussels by the algae or cyanobacteria regime. Moreover, the xenobiotic conjugating enzyme, glutathione S-transferase, hemoprotein oxidase and vitellogenin-like proteins were not affected in mussel organs via ingestion of A. flos-aquae. Our study suggests that ingestion of cyanobacteria leads to increased energy expenses, oxidative stress and increased acetylcholine turnover in mussels.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Spectral Irradiance, Phytoplankton Community Composition and Primary Productivity in a Salt Marsh Estuary, North Inlet, South Carolina, USA
AN  - 1323747171
AB  - We investigated spatial and temporal changes in spectral irradiance, phytoplankton community composition, and primary productivity in North Inlet Estuary, South Carolina, USA. High concentrations of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) were responsible for up to 84Â % of the attenuation of photosynthetically available radiation (PAR). Green-yellow wavelengths were the predominant colors of light available at the two sampling sites: Clam Bank Creek and Oyster Landing. Vertical attenuation coefficients of PAR were 0.7â[euro]"2.1Â m^sup â '1^ with corresponding euphotic zone depths of 1.5â[euro]"6.7Â m. Phytoplankton biomass (as chlorophyll a [chl a]) varied seasonally with a summer maximum of 16Â [mu]g chl a l^sup â '1^ and a winter minimum of 1.4Â [mu]g chl a l^sup â '1^. The phytoplankton community consisted mainly of diatoms, prasinophytes, cryptophytes and haptophytes, with diatoms and prasinophytes accounting for up to 67Â % of total chl a. Changes in phytoplankton community composition showed strongest correlations with temperature. Light-saturated chl a-specific rates of photosynthesis and daily primary productivity varied with season and ranged from 1.6 to 14Â mg C (mg chl a) ^sup â '1^â[euro][per thousand]h^sup â '1^ (32â[euro]"803Â mg C m^sup â '3^â[euro][per thousand]day^sup â '1^). Calculated daily rates added up to an annual carbon fixation rate of 84Â g C m^sup â '3^â[euro][per thousand]year^sup â '1^. Overall, changes in phytoplankton community composition and primary productivity in North Inlet showed a strong dependence on temperature, with PAR and spectral irradiance playing a relatively minor role due to short residence times, strong tidal forcing and vertical mixing.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Response of phytoplankton and zooplankton communities in six reservoirs of the middle Missouri River (USA) to drought conditions and a major flood event
AN  - 1287323948
AB  - We assessed if the qualitative and quantitative aspects of plankton composition in reservoirs of the middle Missouri River were influenced by hydrologic variability. Phytoplankton and zooplankton communities in six reservoirs of this highly regulated system were sampled between 2004 and 2011 during historic drought, subsequent recovery, and a 100-year flood event. The reservoir system encompasses a broad latitudinal gradient of decreasing depth, decreasing water residence time and increasing trophic state. Phytoplankton communities of the upper three reservoirs were co-dominated by planktonic and meroplanktonic diatoms during the drought, recovery, and flood periods, but the proportion of more silicified meroplanktonic diatoms increased in the lower three reservoirs as water residence time decreased. Peak phytoplankton biovolume usually occurred during spring/early summer and was associated with increased hydrologic inflows and outflows. Zooplankton biomass of the reservoir system was dominated by Daphnia spp., but all zooplankton groups decreased as inflows and outflows accelerated during the recovery and flood periods. Rotifer abundances were higher under turbulent conditions associated with dam operations. Canonical correlation analyses suggested that temperature, water residence time, station depth, and water clarity explained more variance in the structures of phytoplankton and zooplankton communities than bioavailable nutrient parameters.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Phenotypic variation of south-western Atlantic clam Mactra isabelleana (Bivalvia: Mactridae)
AN  - 1284604066
AB  - The phenotypic shell shape variation of Mactra isabelleana was tested using the geometric morphometric method. Four localities were sampled along the Río de la Plata estuary and the coast of Buenos Aires province. Principal component analysis and canonical variates analysis of the first principal components were performed to reveal the shell variation and differences among localities, respectively. The specimens from different microhabitats mostly overlapped, although differences in shape were observed in the development of the umbo, the enlargement of the dorsoventral axes and the elongation of the posterior end. The ecological and physical parameters that could influence shell shape variation are discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Output of organic material from land-based juvenile Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) tanks
AN  - 1270352515
AB  - A mass balance experiment was conducted in which dry mass, dissolved organic carbon, total nitrogen, lipid classes, and fatty acids were quantified in the inflow and outflow of land-based juvenile Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) tanks. The inflow contained 89.9 ± 15.4 g/day of dry mass that increased to 187 ± 39 g/day in the outflow. Correction for the inflow indicated 96.8 ± 33.8 g/day of excess feed and faeces left the tanks amounting to a feed to waste conversion ratio of 25 %. The amount of feed in the waste was estimated to be 3 %. The breakdown indicator free fatty acid (43.1 ± 9.5 % total lipid), the markers of zooplankton and subsequent indicators of the feed, 20:1[omega]9 and 22:1[omega]11, and the essential fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) were all significantly higher (p < 0.020) in the outflow compared to the inflow. The output from the entire aquaculture facility was calculated from the experimental tanks and gave 1,060 ± 370 g/day dry mass and 1.5 ± 0.4 g/day DHA, which could support 0.44 tonnes of mussels assuming an average weight of 5.31 g/mussel. Additionally, the output data were calculated per kilogram of fish and used to estimate potential output for operational Atlantic cod farms. An 1,880 tonne farm would produce 3,170 ± 870 kg/day dry mass and 4.7 ± 1.7 kg/day of DHA, which could theoretically support 1,400 tonnes of mussels. Natural mussels and those grown in co-culturing systems could assimilate such valuable compounds that would otherwise be lost.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Antipredator-induced trait changes in Brachionus and prey selectivity by Asplanchna in a large river under low-discharge conditions: evidence from a field study
AN  - 1266623750
AB  - Trait-mediated biotic interactions within zooplankton, such as inducible defences against predation, are key determinants of community structure and dynamics in lentic ecosystems. The role of such interactions in lotic environments, however, has been rarely investigated, as abiotic constraints related to hydrology are generally thought to impair the occurrence of biotic interactions in rivers. We hypothesize that, under conditions of reduced flow during summer, trait-mediated predator-prey interactions can be significant driving forces in the main channel of a large river, despite the disruptive effect of downstream transport. To verify this assumption, we carried out a field study in the lowland stretch of the Po River (Italy). We analysed temporal patterns of morphometric variation in a population of Brachionus calyciflorus, potentially triggered by the predatory rotifer Asplanchna brightwellii. Our results indicate that the presence of Asplanchna can impact the variability of different morphological traits in B. calyciflorus even under the disturbance effect of turbulence and drift. Asplanchna feeding electivity on several taxa was also investigated, confirming the predator ability to efficiently and selectively feed under lotic conditions. We suggest that complex interactions and trade-offs might occur among life-history traits, predator-prey relationships and physical constraints imposed by flow within zooplankton communities in large rivers.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Evidence for Selective Bacterial Community Structuring in the Freshwater Sponge Ephydatia fluviatilis
AN  - 1268353286; 22903086
AB  - To understand the functioning of sponges, knowledge of the structure of their associated microbial communities is necessary. However, our perception of sponge-associated microbiomes remains mainly restricted to marine ecosystems. Here, we report on the molecular diversity and composition of bacteria in the freshwater sponge Ephydatia fluviatilis inhabiting the artificial lake Vinkeveense Plassen, Utrecht, The Netherlands. Polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) fingerprints revealed that the apparent diversities within the domain Bacteria and the phylum Actinobacteria were lower in E. fluviatilis than in bulk water. Enrichment of specific PCR-DGGE bands in E. fluviatilis was detected. Furthermore, sponge- and bulk water-derived bacterial clone libraries differed with respect to bacterial community composition at the phylum level. E. fluviatilis-derived sequences were affiliated with six recognized phyla, i.e., Proteobacteria, Planctomycetes, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chlamydiae and Verrucomicrobia, in order of relative abundance; next to the uncultured candidate phylum TM7 and one deeply rooted bacterial lineage of undefined taxonomy (BLUT). Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were the dominant bacterial phyla in the freshwater clone library whereas sequences affiliated with Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia, Acidobacteria and Armatimonadetes were found at lower frequencies. Fine-tuned phylogenetic inference showed no or negligible overlaps between the E. fluviatilis and water-derived phylotypes within bacterial taxa such as Alphaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria. We also ascertained the status of two alphaproteobacterial lineages as freshwater sponge-specific phylogenetic clusters, and report on high distinctiveness of other E. fluviatilis specific phylotypes, especially within the Bacteroidetes, Planctomycetes and Chlamydia taxa. This study supports the contention that the composition and diversity of bacteria in E. fluviatilis is partially driven by the host organism.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Air, marine, and terrestrial pollution are continuously critical issues to be solved in environmental sciences. Particularly with the recent disaster in the Mexico Gulf and the risk of oil spills from the continuous offshore drilling activities in the North Sea, ecotoxicological profiling requires great attention. Fjord ecosystems are particularly neglected marine ecosystems, which require better surveillance and ecotoxicological profiling. In this context, this study focuses on exploring three potential indicators for aquatic stress [polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), aromatic amines (AAs), and nitroarenes (NAs)] by the study of their molecular and sub-molecular properties. The results show that the aromatic amine, 4-aminobiphenyl, gains a particularly reactive electronic potential, which can be summarized as a large change in LUMO+2 and HOMO-1 electron orbitals upon metabolic activation in the organism. This change in orbitals increases the overall electrostatic energy of the molecule, inducing a high affinity for DNA-adduct formation. Electronic analysis on nitroarenes shows in addition why 1,6-dinitropyrene is more stable than 1,8-dinitropyrene, and how the electrons favor nitrenium activation on the 6th and 8th carbon. Further analysis shows also that PAHs have a present correlation with hormonal similarity, and that their resemblance to estrogen can be correlated to mutagenicity, contributing to increased ecotoxicity. The electronic analysis of these three types of fossil pollutants shows how their toxicity is exerted from the electronic level and which structural features that determine the level of reactivity and toxicity. The summation of the background and electronic properties of these molecular toxins elucidates that PAHs, aromatic amines, and nitroarenes are all of equal importance as stress indicators for fjord systems, with particular emphasis on PAHs, which also exert hormonal structural similarities as a probable base of their carcinogenic mechanisms.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Does size matter? The effects of body size and declining oxygen tension on oxygen uptake in gastropods
AN  - 1159098476
AB  - Metabolic rate is one of the most frequently measured physiological variables and the relationship between oxygen uptake and body mass is one of the most controversial issues in biology. The present study used closed chamber respirometry to compare the oxygen uptake of 32 species of benthic British gastropod molluscs of a wide size-range (from less than 0.001 g to greater than 10 g dry tissue weight). We investigated the effects of body size on the respiratory rate at 10°C to explore the evolutionary and phylogenetically determined patterns of metabolic scaling both among different gastropods groups, and within siphonate and asiphonate caenogastropods. Resting oxygen uptake (                                   O2) increased with body mass (W) with a slope value of 0.6 using both ordinary least squares (OLS) and standard major axis (SMA) where N = 488, over a 6 fold range of body mass. The slopes b of the regression lines relating oxygen uptake to body mass were similar for all heterobranch molluscs and most caenogastropods. Highest mass-specific rates for oxygen consumption were found for the smallest littorinid species. Trophic mode significantly affected the amount of oxygen consumed with higher oxygen uptake in herbivores than other groups, including detritivores and predators. All of the gastropods reduced their oxygen consumption when exposed to declining oxygen conditions; however, about a third of the species exhibited partial regulation at higher oxygen partial pressures. When exposed to 20% normal saturation levels, smaller gastropods respired at approximately 25% of their rates in fully saturated seawater whereas larger species (above 0.1 g dry tissue weight) respired at approximately 35% of the values recorded at full saturation. Our study suggests that a scaling exponent relating O2 to body mass of 0.6 is typical and may be 'universal' for gastropods. It is below the 0.75 scaling exponent which has been proposed for ectothermic invertebrates. It is concluded that size does matter in determining the metabolic patterns of gastropods and that the quantity of oxygen consumed and the energy balance of gastropods is affected by activity, food type and exposure to declining oxygen conditions.

T1  - Temperature-dependent ranges of coexistence in a model of a two-prey-one-predator microbial food web
AN  - 1125259080
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: AQUASHIFT: The Impact of Climate Variability on Aquatic Ecosystems

              
The objective of our study was to analyze the effects of temperature on the population dynamics of a three-species food web consisting of two prey bacteria (Pedobacter sp. and Acinetobacter johnsonii) and a protozoan predator (Tetrahymena pyriformis) as model organisms. We assessed the effects of temperature on the growth rates of all three species with the objective of developing a model with four differential equations based on the experimental data. The following hypotheses were tested at a theoretical level: Firstly, temperature changes can affect the dynamic behavior of a system by temperature-dependent parameters and interactions and secondly, food web response to temperature cannot be derived from the single species temperature response. The main outcome of the study is that temperature changes affect the parameter range where coexistence is possible within all three species. This has significant consequences on our ideas regarding the evaluation of effects of global warming.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Inhibition of cellular efflux pumps involved in multi xenobiotic resistance (MXR) in echinoid larvae as a possible mode of action for increased ecotoxicological risk of mixtures
AN  - 1113172639; 22868905
AB  - In marine organisms the multi xenobiotic resistance (MXR) mechanism via e.g. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) is an important first line of defense against contaminants by pumping contaminants out of the cells. If compounds would impair the MXR mechanism, this could result in increased intracellular levels of other compounds, thereby potentiating their toxicity. A calcein-AM based larval cellular efflux pump inhibition assay (CEPIA) was developed for echinoid (Psammechinus miliaris) larvae and applied for several contaminants. The larval CEPIA revealed that triclosan (TCS) and the nanoparticles P-85^sup ^ (P-85) were 124 and 155× more potent inhibitors (IC^sub 50^ 0.5 ± 0.05 and 0.4 ± 0.1 μM, respectively) of efflux pumps than the model inhibitor Verapamil (VER). PFOS (heptadecafluorooctane sulfonic acid) and pentachlorophenol also were more potent than VER, 24 and 5×, respectively. Bisphenol A and o,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (o,p'-DDT) inhibited efflux pumps with a potency 3× greater than VER. In a 48 h early life stage bioassay with P. miliaris, exposure to a non-lethal concentration of the inhibitors TCS, VER, the model MRP inhibitor MK-571, the nanoparticles P-85 and the model P-gp inhibitor PSC-833, increased the toxicity of the toxic model substrate for efflux pumps vinblastine by a factor of 2, 4, 4, 8 and 16, respectively. Our findings show that several contaminants accumulating in the marine environment inhibit cellular efflux pumps, which could potentiate toxic effects of efflux pumps substrates.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Impact of Oxidative Stress Indicated by Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances (TBARS) and Protein Carbonyl Levels (PC) on Ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) Induction in Common Carp (Cyprinus carpio)
AN  - 1328385201
AB  - This study examined the impact of oxidative stress indicated by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and protein carbonyl (PC), induced by intensive exercise and cadmium chloride (CdCl2) on ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity in juvenile carp (Cyprinus carpio). In the first experiment, fish were divided into three groups: (1) control, (2) carp exposed to intensive exercise, and (3) carp that was not exercised but previously, as well as carp in group 2, received single dose of 3-methylcholantrene (3-MC). The third and sixth day fish were sacrificed and the measurements were conducted. In the second experiment, fish were divided into (1) control, (2) carp in water containing CdCl2, and (3) carp in dechlorinated tap water (2 and 3 received single dose of 3-MC on the seventh day after exposure to CdCl2). The carp were killed 6 days later and livers were excised for biochemical analyses. In the first experiment, on the sixth day after treatment with 3-MC, results show statistically significant increase in EROD activity in non-exercised carp, while that increase in carp exposed to intensive exercise was significantly lower. Three days after exposure to 3-MC, statistically significant increase in TBARS was observed in both exercised and non-exercised carp. Six days after exposure to 3-MC, PC levels were significantly higher in exercised carp. Pretreatment with CdCl2, in the second experiment, caused oxidative stress and reduction of EROD activity.

T1  - Assessing the Oxidative Stress Induced by Paracetamol Spiked in Artificial Sediment on Hyalella azteca
AN  - 1328385081
AB  - Paracetamol is an antipyretic analgesic widely used globally. It has been recurrently found in water bodies and is known to elicit toxic effects in aquatic species; however, its potential ability to induce oxidative stress in sentinel species remains unknown. The objective was to establish a methodology to evaluate the toxicity elicited on the sentinel species Hyalella azteca by paracetamol-enriched sediment using oxidative stress tests. Concentrations used in assays were determined using the previously obtained median lethal concentration (72 h LC50). The following oxidative stress biomarkers were evaluated: lipid peroxidation (LPO), protein carbonyl content (PCC) in order to determine oxidized protein content, and the activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione  peroxidase (GPX). LPO and PCC increased significantly while SOD, CAT, and GPX decreased significantly (p<0.05) with respect to controls. Paracetamol induces oxidative stress on H. azteca, and the set of tests employed is helpful in evaluating the toxicity of this group of pharmaceuticals on aquatic species.  [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AN  - 1038760285; 22821320
AB  - Aquatic environmental pollution may cause biodiversity loss. Thus, monitoring studies are very important because fish health reflects both quality and sustainability of the environment, as well as of the individuals that live there. In the present report, genetic biomarkers (piscine micronucleus test; comet assay with blood, liver, and kidney cells) were used in specimens of Astyanax sp. to analyze the contamination level of the Cangüiri Farm through biomonitoring. The Cangüiri Farm, the old school farm of the Federal University of Paraná, is inside the Iraí River Environment Preservation Area, created in 1996 to preserve the sources of public water supply in Curitiba and metropolitan area. We verified that the fishes collected within the Cangüiri Farm area presented high damage levels, showing more environment contamination when compared to the specimens collected in the Costa Ecologic Park, used as reference in the present report. The results indicate that the Cangüiri Farm, which is inside an environment protection area, created especially for the protection of the fountainhead for water supply, may be contaminated. These toxic residues, which were remarkably persistent in the environment, are possibly derived from agricultural activities in the wider area. Thus, we suggest the analysis of the area with other biomarkers and for a longer time period.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Antagonistic toxicity of arsenate and cadmium in a freshwater amphipod (Gammarus pulex)
AN  - 1037276915; 22535317
AB  - Because toxicants rarely occur alone in the environment, a major challenge in risk assessment is to address the combined effects of chemicals on aquatic organisms. This work is aimed at investigating the joint toxicity action of binary mixtures of cadmium and arsenate on Gammarus pulex. Individuals were exposed during 240 h to four single arsenate or cadmium concentrations and binary mixtures of these metals according to a complete factorial plane. Observed mortality in binary mixtures was compared to observed mortality in single arsenate or cadmium exposures. In addition, interactive effects (antagonistic, additive or synergistic) were evaluated using a predictive model for the theoretically expected interactive effect of chemicals. For all the tested concentration combinations, we observed an antagonist 'between-metals' interaction on G. pulex mortality. This antagonistic effect was more marked for the lowest than for the highest (i.e. 1502.0 μg^sub AsV^ L^sup -1^ and 28.5 μg^sub Cd^ L^sup -1^) tested concentrations of individual metals in binary mixtures. Metal concentrations in body tissues were evaluated and were significantly lower in binary mixtures than in single metal exposures at similar concentration, especially for combinations corresponding to the highest concentrations of both metals (1502.0 μg^sub AsV^ L^sup -1^ and 28.5 μg^sub Cd^ L^sup -1^). Results were discussed in terms of (1) mechanisms of uptake and bioconcentration and (2) relationships between metal concentration in gammarid body and observed toxicity.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Modelling copper bioaccumulation in Gammarus pulex and alterations of digestive metabolism
AN  - 1037276891; 22714815
AB  - Bioaccumulation enables to integrate the ability of aquatic organisms to regulate metals and effects of water chemistry on metal bioavailability. Linking this process to biological responses offers thus promising lines of enquiry for protecting aquatic ecosystems. This study aims at characterizing the mechanisms involved in waterborne Cu bioaccumulation and assessing metal impact on digestive metabolism in an ecosystem engineer widely distributed in Europe, Gammarus pulex. The organism was exposed to several Cu concentrations (from 0.5 to 100 μg/L) in aquatic microcosms to establish kinetic parameters for the construction and comparison of two bioaccumulation models, i.e. the biodynamic and saturation models. Cu uptake was recorded in waters exhibiting various concentrations of Na, Mg and Ca at environmental levels to assess the influence of cationic composition on bioaccumulation. Then, the effect of increasing Cu in exposure media on the digestive metabolism of G. pulex was investigated by measuring enzymatic activities (β-glucosidase, N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase, β-galactosidase). We showed that the saturation model is more suitable than the biodynamic model to describe Cu bioaccumulation in gammarids due to a maximal capacity of animals to accumulate the metal. Cationic composition of water affected insignificantly Cu uptake. All activities of tested enzymes decreased with increasing Cu in exposure media but with different degrees. High correlations were established between the inhibition of enzymatic activities and amounts of Cu bioaccumulated by gammarids. These biological responses could thus provide early-warming of Cu impact on aquatic biota.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Chiral pharmaceuticals in the environment
AN  - 1037276979
AB  - Many pharmaceutical pollutants are chiral, existing in the environment as a single enantiomer or as mixtures of the two enantiomers. In spite of their similar physical and chemical properties, the different spatial configurations lead the enantiomers to have different interactions with enzymes, receptors or other chiral molecules, which can give diverse biological response. Consequently, biodegradation process and ecotoxicity tend to be enantioselective. Despite numerous ongoing research regarding analysis and monitorization of pharmaceutical ingredients in the environment, the fate and effects of single enantiomers of chiral pharmaceuticals (CP) in the environment are still largely unknown. There are only few chiral analytical methods to accurately measure the enantiomeric fraction (EF) in environmental matrices and during biodegradation processes. Furthermore, the ecotoxicity studies usually consider the enantiomeric pair as unique compound. We reviewed the current knowledge about CP in the environment, as well as the chiral analytical methods to determine the EF in environmental matrices. The degradation and removal processes of CP of important therapeutic classes, usually detected in the environment, and their toxicity to aquatic organisms were also reviewed. On the other hand, this review demonstrate that despite the great importance of the stereochemistry in pharmaceutical science, pharmacology and organic chemistry, this is normally neglected in environmental studies. Therefore, CP in the environment need much more attention from the scientific community, and more research within this subject is required.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Zooplankton as an early warning system of persistent organic pollutants contamination in a deep lake (lake Iseo, Northern Italy)
AN  - 2439107326
AB  - The lake Iseo has been recently contaminated by DDT residues, originated from the melting of a glacier that released the pollutants accumulated in the past. Because of this recent input, DDT residues concentrations rose more quickly in zooplankton than in fish during 2009. In autumn 2010 the ratio drastically dropped to one–two for all the compounds indicating that the glacial DDT load should have been ceased. The situation was different for PCBs that were released to a much lower extent from glaciers. The PCB 138 ratio between zooplankton and fish was always around one–two in both years. As the zooplankton response to pollution changes resulted particularly prompt, our research highlights the importance of this component as an early warning bioindicator of hydrophobic pollutants.

T1  - Effects of Depth and Orientation on Marine Fouling Assemblages in the Coastal Waters of Abu Qir Harbor, Egypt
AN  - 1535276199
AB  - This present article aims to study the influences of depth and orientation on the distribution of macrofouling communities at shallow coastal harbour (Abu Qir Harbour, Egypt, southeast Mediterranean Sea). Fouling communities were collected for a period of one year (June 2006-May 2007) by suspended white test panels at different depths (from 0.5 m to 5.5 m) in two directions (horizontal and vertical). Panels were submerged on short-term durations of 30 days. Every panel was studied (on both sides) for species composition and abundance of fouling taxa, as well as the total biomass of the community. Data of fouling assemblages obtained were analysed, using ANOVA and non-parametric tests in order to compare the variations of assemblages with season, depth and direction. In general, the abundance and biomass of fouling community were significantly related to the season and depth rather than orientation. Although comparison of fouling assemblages (for direction) between the panel surfaces were not statistically significant; the horizontal panels, in particular, support more fouling organisms.

T1  - A CONCH WITH A COLLAR: EARLY ONTOGENY OF THE ENIGMATIC FOSSIL BIVALVE MYOCONCHA
AN  - 1030094538
AB  - Larval and juvenile growth stages of myoconchid bivalves (family Kalenteridae) are illustrated and described for the first time. Excellently preserved shells of Myoconcha crassa J. Sowerby, 1824 from the middle Bathonian (Middle Jurassic) clay/silt deposits of southern Poland reveal that the prodissoconch in this taxon is large (exceeding 350 µm in length) and characterized by a prominent, collar-like structure arising from the demarcation to the dissoconch. Similar prodissoconch morphology has not been described previously in any other bivalve genus. The large size and absence of a prodissoconch II strongly suggest a non-planktotrophic development of the larvae, indicating either simple lecithotrophy or long-term brooding and parental care for the larvae in this species. Consequently, the new discovery constitutes the earliest well-documented record of non-planktotrophic development in the Bivalvia. The shell of Myoconcha crassa is composed of an outer cross-lamellar layer and an inner complex cross-lamellar layer. This composition suggests that the Kalenteridae may be included in the Carditida rather than the Palaeoheterodonta or Anomalodesmata. The genus Pseudomyoconcha Rossi Ronchetti and Allasinaz, 1966 is rejected herein and considered as a junior synonym of Myoconcha J. Sowerby, 1824. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Long-Term Changes in the Bioaccumulation of As, Cd, Pb, and Hg in Macroinvertebrates from the Elbe River (Czech Republic)
AN  - 1018636244
AB  - The Elbe River was extremely loaded by heavy metals and arsenic during the second half of the 20th century as a consequence of intensive chemical industry activities. To assess long-term contamination trends in the Elbe after socio-economical changes in 1989, selected macroinvertebrate species were used to identify biotic accumulation levels in the period from 1993 to 2005. Concentrations of As, Cd, Pb, and Hg were determined in Asellus aquaticus (Crustacea), Bythinia tentaculata (Mollusca), Erpobdella spp. (Hirudinea), and larvae of the family Chironomidae (Diptera) over a 3-year period along the longitudinal profile of the Czech part of the Elbe River and the lower Vltava (the main Elbe tributary). In this study, new evaluative approaches were used to assess these multiparameter data sets. The results showed that the most contaminated Czech sites were located in the industry-heavy middle Elbe region between Valy and Obríství. Surprisingly high concentrations of As, Cd, and Pb were observed in the upper stretch near the headwaters. Probably as a consequence of former mining activities and the metallurgic and glass industries, the lower Vltava was loaded with Cd and Pb. Despite substantial improvements in the water quality of the Elbe River within the studied time period, we found no general decreasing trend of As, Cd, and Pb in macrozoobenthos. A significant decrease of Hg was revealed, however, occurring already between 1993 and 1996. The results of interspecies comparisons showed that the investigated elements were most accumulated by chironomid larvae and Erpobdella spp. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The effects of Microcystis aeruginosa (cyanobacterium) on Cryptomonas ovata (Cryptophyta) in laboratory cultures: why these organisms do not coexist in steady-state assemblages?
AN  - 1016441420
AB  - The inhibitory effects of cyanobacterial compounds as possible explanation of the lack of stable Cyanobacteria-Cryptophyta coexistence in steady-state phytoplankton assemblages were studied. The possible interactions between two phytoplankton species, a toxic Microcystis aeruginosa (cyanobacteria) and a non-toxic Cryptomonas ovata (Cryptophyta) were investigated (i) in mixed cultures (containing C. ovata and M. aeruginosa cells); (ii) in M. aeruginosa crude extract-treated C. ovata cultures and (iii) in purified microcystin-LR (MC-LR) treated C. ovata cultures. The results of experiments proved that the presence of living M. aeruginosa cells have more inhibitory effects on C. ovata cultures than the crude extract of the M. aeruginosa cells; or the presence of the purified MC-LR. These results suggest that MCs does not play as important role in cyanobacteria-Cryptophyta interaction as it was presumed; hence more complex effects (allelopathy among them) can be significant in shallow lakes ecosystems.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Large-eddy simulation of oxygen transfer to organic sediment beds
AN  - 1020775510
AB  - We have developed a model for dissolved oxygen (DO) transfer from water to underlying organic sediment beds. The model couples large-eddy simulation (LES) of turbulent transport in the water column, a biogeochemical model for DO transport and consumption in the sediment, and Darcy's Law for the pore water-driven transport. The model highlights the spatial and temporal relationship between the turbulent bursting events, the near-wall transport of DO, and the response of the sediment layer. The numerical resultscompared to data from laboratory experimentsstress the importance of analyzing instantaneous transport events (not reproducible in a Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes model) to better characterize and model the processes that lead to oxygen depletion in the sediment layer. The model's results are compared against experimental data and the sensitivity to the governing parameters has been tested. As the current velocity increases, the sediment-oxygen demand (SOD) increases more slowly than the friction velocity at the wall, in accordance with classic heat-and-mass transfer laws. The overall SOD is approximately proportional to the bacterial content of the sediment layer. The predicted mean advective flux in the porous medium and across the sediment-water interface is negligible compared to the total dispersive flux, for permeabilities typical of the sediments used in the experiments (107 and 106 cm2). Higher permeabilities (105 cm2) appear to yield results not consistent with experimental data. This computational tool will contribute toward the design of a process-oriented parametrization for the SOD, currently missing in oceanographic applications, that can be easily extended to the transport of other bio-limiting substances.

T1  - Sublethal effects of contaminated sediment on Arenicola marina
AN  - 1013849555
AB  - The highest concentrations of environmental contaminants are generally found in marine sediments, and there is a need for knowledge concerning how and whether they affect sediment-dwelling organisms. This study aimed to assess sublethal effects in Arenicola marina exposed to two sediments from a contaminated fjord and two reference locations with different sediment characteristics.

              
Duplicate contaminated sediments were used to investigate the robustness of current protocols for sediment testing. The two reference sediments, with different grain sizes and total organic carbon, were collected from the outer Oslofjord and the two contaminated sediments from Frierfjord. Polychaetes were exposed in quadruplicate sediment microcosms and sampled after 1, 2, 4 and 8 weeks of exposure. Oxidative stress resistance (total oxyradical scavenging capacity, TOSC) and components comprising the energy budget (cellular energy allocation, CEA) were determined for individual polychaetes.

              
Arenicola maintained and increased body weights over the initial 4 weeks of exposure in all groups, except in one reference sediment (Elle). There were no differences between treatments in the scavenging capacity (TOSC). The most striking difference in how polychaetes partitioned energy resources was a difference in lipid and carbohydrate allocations for Arenicola held in the contaminated sediments over the initial weeks. Cellular respiration appeared to increase in polychaetes held in the Elle sediment and decreased for polychaetes held in the two Frierfjord sediments by weeks 4 and 8. In the overall CEA, this was offset by increased energy per weight stored in the Elle group, which resulted in an overall positive CEA for polychaetes held in that sediment, whereas polychaetes in the other treatments were close to neutral. Although CEA would thus indicate that Elle polychaetes had good health status, their body weight also decreased significantly over the experimental period compared to other treatments, indicating an overall negative effect.

              
This study has shown the importance of sediment characteristics when evaluating toxicity and how resource allocation can differ dramatically over a short time span in polychaetes held in similarly contaminated sediments. There were no clear effects of sediment contamination on CEA or TOSC in the polychaete A. marina. The findings are relevant for the design of both short- and long-term sediment studies.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Changes in benthic macroinvertebrate abundance and lake isotope (C, N) signals following biomanipulation: an 18-year study in shallow Lake Vaeng, Denmark
AN  - 929021571
AB  - Change in the abundance of benthic macroinvertebrates and the stable isotope composition (C, N) of benthic invertebrates and zooplankton in Lake Vaeng, Denmark, was investigated over an 18-year period following biomanipulation (removal of cyprinids). During the first nine years after biomanipulation, the lake was clear and submerged macrophytes were abundant; after this period, a shift occurred to low plant abundance and high turbidity. Two years after the biomanipulation, total density of benthic macroinvertebrates reached a maximum of 17042 (±2335 SE) individuals m^sup -2^ and the density was overall higher when the lake was in a clear state. Redundancy analysis (RDA) suggested macrophyte abundance and total nitrogen (TN) concentration were the dominant structuring forces on the benthic macroinvertebrate assemblage. Stable isotope analysis revealed that δ^sup 13^C of macroinvertebrates and zooplankton was markedly higher in years with high submerged macrophyte abundance than in years without macrophytes, most likely reflecting elevated δ^sup 13^C of phytoplankton and periphyton mediated by a macrophyte-induced lowering of lake water CO2 concentrations. We conclude that the strong relationship between macrophyte coverage and δ^sup 13^C of macroinvertebrates and cladocerans may be useful in paleoecological studies of past changes in the dynamics of shallow lakes, as change in macrophyte abundance may be tracked by the δ^sup 13^C of invertebrate remains in the sediment.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Ballast water: Moving towards a de facto standard
AN  - 1022653942
AB  - The Coast Guard instituted a NISA self-policing voluntary BWE program in 1998. However, vessel operators frequently failed to submit ballast reports to the Coast Guard. This continued even after the BWE reports became mandatory in 2004, causing the Coast Guard to conclude that additional measures were needed to protect U.S. waters.

T1  - The individual and population effects of tetracycline on Daphnia magna in multigenerational exposure
AN  - 1012769151; 22252291
AB  - Multigenerational exposure of Daphnia magna to tetracycline was carried out through four consecutive generations. The effects of tetracycline on the survival, reproduction and growth of D. magna were assessed over a period of 21 days per generation. The evaluated endpoints were overall fecundity (total mean neonates per female over 21 days), time to first reproduction, longevity, molting number and somatic growth, such as body weight and body length. Using the results obtained for reproduction and survival rates, the intrinsic population growth rate (PGR) was calculated and compared throughout the generations. Reproductive impairment was observed in all generations and magnified with increasing generation number. The value of no observed effect concentration on D. magna also markedly decreased with increasing generation number. This subsequently resulted in a reduction of the PGR value. In addition, the PGR value was decreased with increasing exposure concentration, decreasing by about 30 and 60% at 0.1 and 5.0 mg/L tetracycline, respectively. On the other hands, somatic growth increased with increasing generation number, because the remaining input energy from the reduced reproduction was mainly used for body maintenance. As a result, the somatic growth and reproduction showed reversed trends on continuous exposure of tetracycline to four generations. In conclusion, multigenerational exposure of tetracycline can induce overall responses on reproduction and the somatic growth of D. magna. Moreover, the PGR value of D. magna exposed to tetracycline was reduced with increasing generation number; thereby, inhibiting the long term propagation of D. magna.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Assessment of microcystin distribution and biomagnification in tissues of aquatic food web compartments from a shallow lake and evaluation of potential risks to public health
AN  - 1012769128; 22383140
AB  - The objectives of this study were: (1) to examine the distribution and bioaccumulation of microcystins in the main components of the food web (phytoplankton, zooplankton, crayfish, shrimp, mussel, snail, fish, frog) of Lake Pamvotis (NW Greece), (2) to investigate the possibility of microcystin biomagnification and (3) to evaluate the potential threat of the contaminated aquatic organisms to human health. Significant microcystin concentrations were detected in all the aquatic organisms during two different periods, with the higher concentrations observed in phytoplankton and the lower in fish species and frogs. This is the first study reporting microcystin accumulation in the body of the freshwater shrimp Atyaephyra desmsaresti, in the brain of the fish species common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and in the skin of the frog Rana epirotica. Although there was no evidence for microcystin biomagnification, the fact that microcystins were found in lake water and in the tissues of aquatic organisms, suggests that serious risks to animal and public health are possible to occur. In addition, it is likely to be unsafe to consume aquatic species harvested in Lake Pamvotis due to the high-concentrations of accumulated microcystins.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Practical considerations for conducting ecotoxicity test methods with manufactured nanomaterials: what have we learnt so far?
AN  - 1012769107; 22422174
AB  - This review paper reports the consensus of a technical workshop hosted by the European network, NanoImpactNet (NIN). The workshop aimed to review the collective experience of working at the bench with manufactured nanomaterials (MNMs), and to recommend modifications to existing experimental methods and OECD protocols. Current procedures for cleaning glassware are appropriate for most MNMs, although interference with electrodes may occur. Maintaining exposure is more difficult with MNMs compared to conventional chemicals. A metal salt control is recommended for experiments with metallic MNMs that may release free metal ions. Dispersing agents should be avoided, but if they must be used, then natural or synthetic dispersing agents are possible, and dispersion controls essential. Time constraints and technology gaps indicate that full characterisation of test media during ecotoxicity tests is currently not practical. Details of electron microscopy, dark-field microscopy, a range of spectroscopic methods (EDX, XRD, XANES, EXAFS), light scattering techniques (DLS, SLS) and chromatography are discussed. The development of user-friendly software to predict particle behaviour in test media according to DLVO theory is in progress, and simple optical methods are available to estimate the settling behaviour of suspensions during experiments. However, for soil matrices such simple approaches may not be applicable. Alternatively, a Critical Body Residue approach may be taken in which body concentrations in organisms are related to effects, and toxicity thresholds derived. For microbial assays, the cell wall is a formidable barrier to MNMs and end points that rely on the test substance penetrating the cell may be insensitive. Instead assays based on the cell envelope should be developed for MNMs. In algal growth tests, the abiotic factors that promote particle aggregation in the media (e.g. ionic strength) are also important in providing nutrients, and manipulation of the media to control the dispersion may also inhibit growth. Controls to quantify shading effects, and precise details of lighting regimes, shaking or mixing should be reported in algal tests. Photosynthesis may be more sensitive than traditional growth end points for algae and plants. Tests with invertebrates should consider non-chemical toxicity from particle adherence to the organisms. The use of semi-static exposure methods with fish can reduce the logistical issues of waste water disposal and facilitate aspects of animal husbandry relevant to MMNs. There are concerns that the existing bioaccumulation tests are conceptually flawed for MNMs and that new test(s) are required. In vitro testing strategies, as exemplified by genotoxicity assays, can be modified for MNMs, but the risk of false negatives in some assays is highlighted. In conclusion, most protocols will require some modifications and recommendations are made to aid the researcher at the bench.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Nitrogen removal in coastal sediments of the German Wadden Sea
AN  - 922786311
AB  - Although sediments of the German Wadden Sea are suspected to eliminate a considerable share of nitrate delivered to the SE North Sea, their denitrification rates have not been systematically assessed. We determined N2 production rates over seasonal cycles (February 2009-April 2010) at two locations with two sediments types each, the first site (Meldorf Bight) receiving nitrate during all seasons from the Elbe river plume, and a second site on the island of Sylt, where nitrate is depleted during summer months. In sediments from the Sylt site, N2 production ranged from 15 to 32 μmol N2 m^sup -2^ h^sup -1^ in the fine sand station and from 7 to 13 μmol N2 m^sup -2^ h^sup -1^ in the coarse sand station; N2 production was not detected when nitrate was depleted in May and July of 2009. N2 production in the Meldorf Bight sediments were consistently detected at higher rates (58-130 μmol N2 m^sup -2^ h^sup -1^ in the very fine sand station and between 14 and 30 μmol N2 m^sup -2^ h^sup -1^ in the medium sand station). Analysis of ancillary parameters suggests that major factors controlling N2 production in coastal sediments of the German Wadden Sea are the nitrate concentrations in the overlying water, the ambient temperature, and the organic matter content of the sediment. Extrapolating our spot measurements to the zone of nitrate availability and sediment types, we estimate an annual nitrogen removal rate around 16 kt N year^sup -1^ for the entire northern sector of the German Wadden Sea area. This corresponds to 14% of the annual Elbe river nitrogen load.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Food Web Structure of the Alaskan Nearshore Shelf and Estuarine Lagoons of the Beaufort Sea
AN  - 923211796
AB  - Issue Title: Special Section: The Arctic Ocean Estuary

              
The eastern Alaska Beaufort Sea coast is characterized by numerous shallow (2-5 m) estuarine lagoons, fed by streams and small rivers that drain northward from the Brooks Range through the arctic coastal plain, and bounded seaward by barrier islands and shoals. Millions of birds from six continents nest and forage during the summer period in this region using the river deltas, lagoons, and shoreline along with several species of anadromous and marine fish. We examined biogeochemical processes linking the benthic community to the overall food web structure of these poorly studied but pristine estuaries, which are largely covered by 1.8 m of ice for 10 months annually. In summer, these lagoons are relatively warm with brackish salinities (5-10°C, S=10-25) compared to more open coastal waters (0-5°C, S>27). The stable isotopic composition of organic materials in sediments (i.e., benthic particulate organic matter) and water column suspended particulate organic matter from both streams and lagoons are largely indistinguishable and reflect strong terrestrial contributions, based upon δ^sup 13^C and δ^sup 15^N values (-25.6[per thousand] to -27.4[per thousand] and 1.4[per thousand] to 3.3[per thousand], respectively). By comparison, shifts toward more heavy isotope-enriched organic materials reflecting marine influence are observed on the adjacent coastal shelf (-24.8[per thousand] to -25.4[per thousand] and 3.4[per thousand] to 5.3[per thousand], respectively). The isotopic composition of lagoon fauna is consistent with a food web dominated by omnivorous detritovores strongly dependent on microbial processing of terrestrial sources of carbon. Biomagnification of ^sup 15^N in benthic organisms indicate that the benthic food web in lagoons support up to four trophic levels, with carnivorous gastropod predators and benthic fishes (δ^sup 15^N values up to 14.4[per thousand]) at the apex.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Arsenic toxicity in a sediment-dwelling polychaete: detoxification and arsenic metabolism
AN  - 920995602; 22083342
AB  - The accumulation, subcellular distribution and speciation of arsenic in the polychaete Arenicola marina were investigated under different laboratory exposure conditions representing a range of metal bioavailabilities, to gain an insight into the physiological mechanisms of how A. marina handles bioaccumulated arsenic and to improve our understanding of the potential ecotoxicological significance of bioaccumulated arsenic in this deposit-feeder. The exposure conditions included exposure to sublethal concentrations of dissolved arsenate, exposure to sublethal concentrations of sediment-bound metal mining mixtures, and exposure to lethal concentrations of sediment-bound metal mining mixtures and arsenic- and multiple metal-spiked sediments. The sub-lethal exposures indicate that arsenic bioaccumulated by the deposit-feeding polychaete A. marina is stored in the cytosol as heat stable proteins (~50%) including metallothioneins, possibly as As (III)-thiol complexes. The remaining arsenic is mainly accumulated in the fraction containing cellular debris (~20%), with decreasing proportions accumulated in the metal-rich granules, organelles and heat-sensitive proteins fractions. A biological detoxified metal compartment including heat stable proteins and the fraction containing metal-rich granules is capable of binding arsenic coming into the cells at a constant rate under sublethal arsenic bioavailabilities. The remaining arsenic entering the cell is bound loosely into the cellular debris fraction, which can be subsequently released and diverted to an expanding detoxified pool. Our results suggest that a metal sensitive compartment comprising the cellular debris, enzymes and organelles fractions may be more representative of the toxic effects observed.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Cellular and Transcriptional Responses of Crassostrea gigas Hemocytes Exposed in Vitro to Brevetoxin (PbTx-2)
AN  - 1536000856
AB  - Hemocytes mediate a series of immune reactions essential for bivalve survival in the environment, however, the impact of harmful algal species and their associated phycotoxins upon bivalve immune system is under debate. To better understand the possible toxic effects of these toxins, Crassostrea gigas hemocytes were exposed to brevetoxin (PbTx-2). Hemocyte viability, monitored through the neutral red retention and MTT reduction assays, and apoptosis (Hoechst staining) remained unchanged during 12 h of exposure to PbTx-2 in concentrations up to 1000 µg/L. Despite cell viability and apoptosis remained stable, hemocytes incubated for 4 h with 1000 µg/L of PbTx-2 revealed higher expression levels of Hsp70 (p < 0.01) and CYP356A1 ( p < 0.05) transcripts and a tendency to increase FABP expression, as evaluated by Real-Time quantitative PCR. The expression of other studied genes (BPI, IL-17, GSTO, EcSOD, Prx6, SOD and GPx) remained unchanged. The results suggest that the absence of cytotoxic effects of PbTx-2 in Crassostrea gigas hemocytes, even at high concentrations, allow early defense responses to be produced by activating protective mechanisms associated to detoxification (CYP356A1 and possibly FABP) and stress (Hsp70), but not to immune or to antioxidant (BPI, IL-17, EcSOD, Prx6, GPx and SOD) related genes.

T1  - Cross-shelf thermal variability in southern Lake Michigan during the stratified periods: [1]
AN  - 965195319
AB  - Results from a field experiment in southern Lake Michigan are used to quantify the cross-shelf nearshore variability in Great Lakes temperatures during the stratified season. The experiment was conducted along the Indiana coast of southern Lake Michigan, with temperature and velocity moorings arranged in a cross-shelf transect that extended to approximately 20 km from shore (40 m depth). The field site is noteworthy because of its location at the end of a major axis of an elliptical Great Lake, the relatively mild bathymetric slope, and local shoreline orientation that is perpendicular relative to the dominant summer winds. Measurements demonstrate that the location of the thermocline-bottom intersection is highly variable, causing a wide zone of extreme thermal variability in the nearshore region with time scales of variability ranging from hours to months. Near-inertial internal Poincaré waves are shown to cause large thermocline excursions but primarily only during periods of elevated activity. Several full upwelling events were observed, but in general, they were brief, lasting only 1-2 days, and had very limited spatial extent (2.5 km or less). Nonetheless, the offshore extent of the upwelling front was shown to be reasonably estimated with a simple estimate of the cross-shelf transport caused by alongshore wind events. A persistent feature that determined the zone of elevated thermal variability (the thermocline-shelf intersection point) was the strongly tilted thermocline, which resulted in the thermocline being located very close to shore. No evidence was found to support the hypothesis that internal Kelvin waves affect thermal variability at the study location.

T1  - The role of barriers and gradients in differentiation processes of pyrgulinid microgastropods of Lake Ohrid
AN  - 917322285
AB  - Issue Title: Evolution and Biodiversity in Ancient Lakes - Proceedings of the 5th Symposium on Speciation in Ancient Lakes, Ohrid, Macedonia, September 7-11, 2009

              
Ancient Lake Ohrid is characterized by vertical (bathymetrical) zones within the lake, presumably promoting allopatric speciation due to barriers or parapatric speciation along gradients. Examples within the lake include the belt of Chara algae as well as the shell zone, both presumably impeding migrations of benthic invertebrates. Three potential cases of vertical differentiation leading to distinct depth forms have been reported for the gastropod subfamily Pyrgulinae (Caenogastropoda: Hydrobiidae): Ginaia munda ssp., Macedopyrgula spp. and Ochridopyrgula macedonica ssp. Based on DNA data of the COI gene from a total of 145 specimens, this article aims at investigating the vertical differentiation within these depth forms and thus patterns of speciation in Lake Ohrid. An initial morphometric analysis showed a clear correlation of shell shape and collecting depth for Ginaia munda ssp. and Macedopyrgula spp. This morphological trend is largely reflected in the genetic structure of the respective taxa. The data presented here indicate the existence of strong gradients of abiotic and biotic factors in Lake Ohrid rather than distinct barriers. Therefore, parapatric speciation may be the predominant form of differentiation of benthic invertebrates in the lake. Incomplete lineage sorting, hybridization and phenotypic plasticity possibly caused by epigenetic mechanisms are discussed as possible reasons for the incongruence between geno- and phenotype observed in few specimens of Ginaia munda ssp. and Macedopyrgula spp. For the third taxon, Ochridopyrgula macedonica ssp., morphometric and genetic analyses revealed only weak support for the previously proposed depth forms. However, a horizontal differentiation of lake and spring populations was revealed instead, and parapatric and allopatric differentiations are discussed in this taxon.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Metal concentrations in urban riparian sediments along an urbanization gradient
AN  - 911122927
AB  - Urbanization impacts fluvial systems via a combination of changes in sediment chemistry and basin hydrology. While chemical changes in urban soils have been well characterized, similar surveys of riparian sediments in urbanized areas are rare. Metal concentrations were measured in sediments collected from riparian areas across the urbanization gradient in Baltimore, MD. Average metal concentrations are similar to those observed in other regional studies. Two important spatial patterns are evident in the data. First, calcium concentrations double across the urbanization gradient, regardless of changes in underlying geochemistry at the boundary between the Eastern US Piedmont and Coastal Plain physiographic provinces. Alkali-earth metal ratios indicate that the additional Ca is very pure and possibly arises from cement common to urban systems. Second, hot spots of trace metals typically associated with urban systems (e.g., Cu, Zn, and Pb) occur in areas that have been artificially filled to create additional real estate in high land value areas. Together, these data indicate that riparian sediments exhibit unexpected patterns of metal contamination. If these sediments are remobilized, during events such as droughts or floods, this contamination may perpetuate legacy impacts to ecosystem health from a history of fluvial contamination.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Immunotoxic effects of triclosan in the clam Ruditapes philippinarum
AN  - 914305768; 21847659
AB  - The effects of Triclosan (TCS) on the immune parameters of the clam Ruditapes philippinarum were investigated after a 7-day exposure to sublethal TCS concentrations (300, 600, and 900 ng l^sup -1^). Hemocytes from controls and exposed clams were collected, and the effects of TCS on total hemocyte count (THC), hemocyte diameter and volume, uptake of the vital dye Neutral Red (an indicator of pinocytosis), lysozyme activity, and proliferation were evaluated. The cytotoxicity, which was evaluated using the lactate dehydrogenase assay, and the capability of TCS to induce DNA fragmentation, which indicated apoptosis, were also investigated. The exposure of clams to all tested TCS concentrations significantly decreased THC, whereas the highest tested TCS concentration significantly reduced the diameter and volume of hemocytes. TCS negatively affected pinocytosis and the proliferation of hemocytes, but it did not alter hemocyte lysozyme activity. TCS exerted cytotoxic effects and induced DNA fragmentation in hemocytes of R. philippinarum. Overall, these results suggest a relationship between TCS exposure and changes in the measured immune parameters and indicate immunosuppression in TCS-treated clams.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Retrospective qualitative analysis of ecological networks under environmental perturbation: a copper-polluted intertidal community as a case study
AN  - 914305739; 21877226
AB  - The coast of Chañaral Bay in northern Chile has been affected by copper mine wastes for decades. This sustained perturbation has disrupted the intertidal community in several ways, but the mechanisms behind the observed shifts in local biodiversity remain poorly understood. Our main goal was to identify the species (lumped into trophic groups) belonging to the Chañaral intertidal community that, being directly affected by copper pollution, contributed primarily to the generation of the observed changes in community structure. These groups of species were called initiators. We applied a qualitative modelling approach based only on the sign and direction of effects among species, and present a formula for predicting changes in equilibrium abundances considering stress on multiple variables simultaneously. We then applied this technique retrospectively to identify the most likely set of initiators. Our analyses allowed identification of a unique set of four initiators in the studied intertidal system (a group of algae, sessile invertebrates, a group of herbivores and starfish), which were hypothesized to be the primary drivers of the observed changes in community structure. In addition, a hypothesis was derived about how the perturbation affected these initiators. The hypothesis is that pollution affected negatively the population growth rate of both algae and sessile invertebrates and suppressed the interaction between herbivores and starfish. Our analytic approach, focused on identifying initiators, constitutes an advance towards understanding the mechanisms underlying human-driven ecosystem disruption and permits identifying species that may serve as a focal point for community management and restoration.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Acute toxicity and responses of antioxidant systems to 1-methyl-3-octylimidazolium bromide at different developmental stages of goldfish
AN  - 914305713; 21912977
AB  - Acute toxicity of 1-methyl-3-octylimidazolium bromide ([C^sub 8^mim]Br) to goldfish at different developmental stages and responses of the antioxidant system in adult goldfish were evaluated in the present study. The results indicate that post-embryonic developmental toxicity of [C^sub 8^mim]Br on goldfish is developmental-stage dependent. The juvenile and larva goldfish are more sensitive to [C^sub 8^mim]Br-toxicity than the adult fish. Histological observations in adult goldfish reveal that acute [C^sub 8^mim]Br exposure damages the hepatopancreas, intestines, and kidneys, indicating that these are possible target organs of [C^sub 8^mim]Br toxicity in goldfish. Subsequent biochemical assays in adult goldfish show that [C^sub 8^mim]Br also induces changes in the activities of the superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione content of fish hepatopancreas. These results suggest that [C^sub 8^mim]Br exposure may induce oxidant stress and lipid peroxidation in hepatopancreas of adult goldfish. In addition, we also find that [C^sub 8^mim]Br causes a remarkable increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in the hepatopancreas of adult goldfish, and thus we think that the MDA level change can be a biomarker of [C^sub 8^mim]Br toxicity in goldfish. The present study indicates that ionic liquids can be a threat to the survival, growth, and development of the fish population once they are accidentally leaked into aquatic ecosystems.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Energy Basal Levels and Allocation among Lipids, Proteins, and Carbohydrates in Enchytraeus albidus: Changes Related to Exposure to Cu Salt and Cu Nanoparticles
AN  - 909411538
AB  - Energy intake and allocation are mainly used to maintain body functions, such as locomotion, growth, and reproductive output. It has been observed that environmental pollutants can affect the energy allocation either due to a cost of handling toxicants or because the toxicant interacts with the storage processes within the organisms. Less than a handful of studies are available reporting the effect of toxicants on energy reserves in enchytraeids and no studies have dealt with the influence of nanomaterials. The present paper shows results on the basal energy reserves (lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins) in Enchytraeus albidus and the influence of copper (Cu) salt and Cu nanoparticles on these reserves for two exposure durations. The energy allocation levels follow what has been reported for other worm species, although lower carbohydrate levels were observed. There were clear differences between worms exposed to control soils and those exposed to Cu for 3 weeks, but no difference after 6 weeks exposure. There was no apparent difference between the impacts of the two Cu exposure forms.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - pH tolerance of the biofouling invasive hydrozoan Cordylophora caspia
AN  - 906335486
AB  - The hydrozoan Cordylophora caspia, with its origin in the Caspian and Black Seas, is considered an invasive biofouling species to power stations and water treatment plants in Brazil, causing economic and ecological impacts. Tolerance of the species to variation in pH was tested to evaluate its resistance to acidic and basic pH levels. Values of pH were tested over a range from 4.0 to 10.0. The colonies were exposed for 6 h to each treatment, using phosphoric acid and NaOH to set water pH to the desired acidic or basic levels, respectively. Colonies of C. caspia displayed 100% mortality only at pH 4 and 10, and showed high survival rates (>50%) within the pH range of 5.0-8.5. The species demonstrated tolerance to a wide range of pH levels, and the results will help in the development of techniques to reduce biofouling by this species. Treatments that keep the pH below 5 or above 8.5 for at least 6 h are suggested to control and eradicate C. caspia where fouling causes significant economic impacts.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Shell Shape Analysis and Spatial Allometry Patterns of Manila Clam ( Ruditapes philippinarum) in a Mesotidal Coastal Lagoon
AN  - 1272300942
AB  - While gradual allometric changes of shells are intrinsically driven by genotype, morphometrical shifts can also be modulated by local environmental conditions. Consequently the common use of a unique dimension (usually length) to assess bivalves' growth may mask phenotypic differences in valve shape among populations. A morphometric exhaustive study was conducted on Manila clam, Ruditapes philippinarum, by acquiring data in the French Arcachon Bay (intrasite phenotypic variability) and by comparing with other sites in the literature (intersite phenotypic variability). 2070 shells were subsampled, weighted, and automatically measured using TNPC software. Some ratios' values indicate a relatively round and globular shape shell in comparison with other sites confirming poor conditions for some individuals. Among adult clams, three main morphological groups were identified and discussed according to spatial considerations. Allometric relations for pairs of shell descriptors were determined by testing classical linear and piecewise regression models on log-transformed relation of Huxley. A significant shape change correlated to size was observed; it corresponds to the second year of life of the clam. Relationships between density, disease, and shell shape are demonstrated and discussed related to other potential factors affecting shell shape. Finally, consequences on population regulation are addressed.

T1  - Microzooplankton as a food source for the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas: seasonal variation in gut contents and food availability
AN  - 902826008
AB  - In this study I investigated the seasonal occurrence of microzooplankton in the gut of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas. Gut contents consisted of various microzooplankton, including tintinnid ciliates, dinoflagellates (Dinophysis spp.), copepods, copepod nauplii, bivalve larvae, and rotifers. Monthly variations in the abundance of protists (tintinnids and Dinophysis spp.) in the gut contents were significantly correlated with the variation in their abundances in the surrounding seawater, whereas this relationship was not significant with metazoans (copepods, copepod nauplii, and bivalve larvae). In laboratory experiments, oysters actively fed on ciliates. When oysters fed on ciliates labeled with a stable nitrogen isotope (^sup 15^N), the ^sup 15^N:total N ratio of the oyster tissues was significantly higher than that for oysters under a no-food condition, suggesting that oysters assimilate nitrogen of the ciliates into their body tissues. Based on these results, I conclude that microzooplankton forms an important food source for oysters, especially when other food sources such as phytoplankton are not abundant.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - On Factors Controlling Air-Water Gas Exchange in a Large Tidal River
AN  - 897818948
AB  - Air-water gas exchange is an important process in aquatic systems, including tidal rivers and estuaries. While there are now reliable and routine methods for determining gas exchange over a range of temporal and spatial scales in the ocean and these measurements have resulted in widely used wind speed parameterizations to calculate air-sea gas exchange, the same has not been true for coastal inland waterways. Some studies have suggested that this difference is methodological, while others point to the existence of additional drivers for gas exchange besides wind in rivers and estuaries. Here, we present gas transfer velocities measured in the tidal Hudson River with a method widely used in oceanic studies, the ^sup 3^He/SF^sub 6^ dual tracer technique. Airside and waterside forcings were determined with an anemometer and an acoustic Doppler current profiler, respectively. The results confirm that wind is the dominant driver of gas exchange in the tidal Hudson River, with negligible contribution from bottom-generated turbulence. Furthermore, a parameterization between wind speed and gas exchange developed for the ocean is able to predict gas exchange in this environment with high accuracy. It is hoped that by transferring methodology used in oceanic studies to rivers and estuaries, robust data can be obtained that will eventually allow development of widely applicable relationships between easily measured environmental variables and gas exchange in tidal inland waters.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Water quality assessment by means of HFNI valvometry and high-frequency data modeling
AN  - 893875128; 21229302
AB  - The high-frequency measurements of valve activity in bivalves (e.g., valvometry) over a long period of time and in various environmental conditions allow a very accurate study of their behaviors as well as a global analysis of possible perturbations due to the environment. Valvometry uses the bivalve's ability to close its shell when exposed to a contaminant or other abnormal environmental conditions as an alarm to indicate possible perturbations in the environment. The modeling of such high-frequency serial valvometry data is statistically challenging, and here, a nonparametric approach based on kernel estimation is proposed. This method has the advantage of summarizing complex data into a simple density profile obtained from each animal at every 24-h period to ultimately make inference about time effect and external conditions on this profile. The statistical properties of the estimator are presented. Through an application to a sample of 16 oysters living in the Bay of Arcachon (France), we demonstrate that this method can be used to first estimate the normal biological rhythms of permanently immersed oysters and second to detect perturbations of these rhythms due to changes in their environment. We anticipate that this approach could have an important contribution to the survey of aquatic systems. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The characteristics of automobile catalyst-derived platinum group elements in road dusts and roadside soils: a case study in the Pearl River Delta region, South China
AN  - 1020988127
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Environmental Problems and Solutions in China

              
The emission of platinum group elements (PGE) from automobile catalytic converters has led to enrichment of PGE in road dusts and roadside soils in urban areas that are well above the natural background levels. This paper evaluates the source of contamination of all the PGE and Au in road dusts and roadside soils in the Pearl River Delta region, including three major cities, Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Hong Kong, South China. Samples were digested using Carius tube and analyzed by isotope dilution ICP-MS; Os was separated by distillation and other PGE by Te-coprecipitation. All samples have elevated PGE concentrations above the background values of uncontaminated soils and contain higher Pt, Pd and Rh than other PGE. The maximum values are 181 ng/g Pt, 514 ng/g Pd, 53 ng/g Rh and 1345 ng/g Au. There are clear positive correlations between Pt and Pd, Pt and Rh, and Pd and Rh, indicating that the main emitted of PGE from automobile catalyst are Pt, Pd and Rh. High concentrations of Au were also found in road dust samples from Hong Kong and Shenzhen. Dust samples with higher Os contents have lower ^sup 187^Os/^sup 188^Os ratios. Samples from Hong Kong show relatively high Pt/Rh ratios. Positive correlations between Pt and Ru, and Pt and Ir were found in Shenzhen and Hong Kong, but only positive correlations between Pt and Ir were found in Guangzhou. These different characteristics reflect different automobile catalytic systems used in Hong Kong and mainland China.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Current concentrations and spatial and temporal trends in mercury in Great Lakes Herring Gull eggs, 1974-2009
AN  - 890406642; 21833543
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Mercury in the Great Lakes

              
Current concentrations and spatial and temporal trends of total mercury (Hg) were assessed in eggs of the Herring Gull (Larus argentatus) over the period 1974-2009 at 15 sites in the Great Lakes: 2-3 sites per lake and one site in each of 3 connecting channels. Current (2009) concentrations ranged from 0.064 μg/g (wet weight) at Chantry Island (Lake Huron) to 0.246 μg/g at Middle Island (Lake Erie). There were significant inter-colony differences in mean Hg concentrations (2005-2009). Mercury concentrations at 14 of 15 sites declined from 23 to 86% between when it was first measured (usually 1974) and 2009. Declining temporal trends over the entire period (1974-2009) were significant at 10 of the 15 sites. On the other hand, there were no significant trends in mercury over the last 15 years. In the early years, declines of Hg in Herring Gull eggs tracked those in Rainbow Smelt (Osmerus mordax) in most Great Lakes. More recently, declines in gull eggs were more evident than in smelt and may be partially explained by temporal changes in the gull diet. When gull Hg data were adjusted for temporal changes in the gull diet, as inferred from stable nitrogen isotope values in eggs, significant declines in egg mercury levels were found only at 4 of 15 sites. Overall, Hg concentrations have declined in Great Lakes Herring Gull eggs over the period 1974-2009 but changes in the gull diet may be contributing, in part, to those declines. Examination of contaminant temporal trends in multiple indicator species will ensure accurate inferences regarding contaminant availability in the environment.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Stoichiometric relationship between suspension-feeding caddisfly (Trichoptera: Brachycentridae) and seston
AN  - 883902388
AB  - Organisms must acquire adequate amounts of carbon (C) and nutrients [i.e., nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P)] from their food to support growth. The growth of organisms can be constrained by consumer-resource elemental imbalances in C:nutrient ratios, especially in aquatic ecosystems. Furthermore, the elemental composition of aquatic organisms can change through ontogeny, which can impose additional challenges to growth (the growth rate hypothesis), terminal body size, and reproductive output. In streams, growth in larval aquatic insects is influenced primarily by food quality and quantity, temperature, and population density. We conducted a field study that tracked the growth of a common suspension-feeding caddisfly (Brachycentrus occidentalis) through its ontogeny by comparing the elemental composition (C:N:P) of the organism with its available food supply (suspended particulate organic matter or seston). Larvae and seston were sampled from four streams throughout 1 year. Differences in the growth of larvae among the streams were evident, even though the streams possessed similar thermal regimes. Spatial and temporal differences in the nutrient contents of B. occidentalis and seston were observed, suggesting a consumer-resource elemental imbalance. Lower C:P and N:P ratios in food were positively correlated to larval growth rate, suggesting growth was limited by P. The C, N, and P contents in B. occidentalis' body tissue did change throughout ontogeny. C:nutrient ratios varied across sites during larval development; however, inter-site variation decreased substantially as the populations approached pupation. Ultimately, consumer-resource elemental imbalances during the larval stage did not lead to differences in pre-emergent standing stocks across sites.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Evaluation of genotoxicity in Rhamdia quelen (Pisces, Siluriformes) after sub-chronic contamination with Fipronil
AN  - 880344283; 21188511
AB  - Diverse genetic biomarkers have been used to evaluate the effects of pollution by mutagenic agents such as metals and pesticides, as well as a large variety of chemical substances derived from human activities. This work researched the effects that an exposure of 60 days to the insecticide Fipronil (concentrations of 0.05, 0.10 and 0.23 μg/L) can cause in the fish Rhamdia quelen using Comet assay with gills, histopathological analysis of gills and the Piscine Micronucleus test and Nuclear Morphological Alterations. The results for the Comet assay and for gills histopathological injuries showed no difference between the control group and the contaminated groups. In the Piscine Micronucleus test, the smallest concentration of Fipronil (0.05 μg/L) was similar as the control group, while concentrations of 0.10 and 0.23 μg/L caused more damage to the DNA. These results suggested that only the highest concentrations of Fipronil tested cause damage in erythrocytes, but none of these concentrations was sufficient to alter the DNA in the gill cells. R. quelen may be a less sensitive bioindicator than other fish that have been tested. On the other hand, the concentrations used may not have been sufficient to detect alterations in the DNA of R. quelen with the chosen tests. Works like this take on great importance given the enormous quantity of substances that are thrown daily into the environment in an uncontrolled way, without evaluation of the consequences. The application of these tests with other concentrations, tissues and exposure times is suggested for future works.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - A history of acid mine contamination, recovery, and eutrophication in Sandy Lake, Pennsylvania
AN  - 879076871
AB  - Sandy Lake, PA, was subject to acid mine contamination in the 1860s, which led to complete extirpation of fish. The mine effluent was soon diverted, but the watershed experienced continued deforestation, agricultural development, and population growth to the beginning of the twentieth century. Paleolimnological analyses of metals and diatoms clearly show the onset of acid mine drainage with rapid increases in concentrations of iron, manganese and sulfur, and decreases in diatom-inferred pH in the sedimentary profile, and a very rapid recovery following remediation. Diatom-inferred phosphorus suggests a period of oligotrophication following diversion of the acid mine drainage and reduction in lake catchment area. However, analyses of nutrients and algal pigments suggest continued eutrophication to the present in spite of increasing forest cover and a stable population over the last century. Pigments indicate a tenfold increase in phytoplankton, with cyanobacteria becoming a more significant portion of the biomass. Accumulation of sedimentary phosphorus has increased by a factor of 4 and sedimentary organic carbon by a factor of 5 since the mid-1800s.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in fish and crayfish from the Calumet region of southwestern Lake Michigan
AN  - 876052176; 21594573
AB  - We identified and quantified polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in six aquatic taxa from the Calumet region of southwestern Lake Michigan in order to examine their differential exposure to and health risks from PAH. There was a high degree of variation in PAH concentrations across and within sites. Mean concentrations of total PAH were high in alewife (1,064 ng/g) and minnows (345 ng/g) collected from the Indiana Ship Canal, when compared to other taxa and locations. Concentrations of PAH in sunfish were relatively low (10 to 79 ng/g), even where environmental concentrations were elevated. In sunfish, regardless of location, concentrations of CHR, FLA, FLU, PHE and PYR were high whereas DBA, IPE, BAP, BBF, BGP and BKF concentrations were low. PAH concentrations in crayfish exceeded those of other taxa at three of four locations where they co-occurred. PAH profiles were similar in crayfish, sunfish and minnows from locations where sediment concentrations were low. Profiles for crayfish and minnows from a location where sediment concentrations were elevated displayed lower concentrations of ACY, and higher concentrations of BAA, BBF, and BKF, than those from the other three locations. In contrast, the profiles in sunfish from those three locations were similar. The PHE/ANT and FLA/PYR ratios for crayfish, minnows and sunfish suggested that the primary sources at most locations were pyrogenic, although some sites had strong petrogenic influences. Toxic equivalency factors in biota generally reflected the magnitude of sediment contamination. In three of four locations where they co-occurred, TEQs were higher in crayfish than in sunfish and minnows. Sunfish had higher TEQs than minnows at most, though not all, locations; TEQs were notably higher in minnows as compared to sunfish from the Little Calumet River. The selection of aquatic species as sentinels of PAH exposure and risks needs to consider differences in ecologies of taxa as well as the relative magnitude of sediment contamination.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Acute toxicity of nonylphenols and bisphenol A to the embryonic development of the abalone Haliotis diversicolor supertexta
AN  - 876051932; 21479784
AB  - Acute toxic effects and mechanisms of two typical endocrine disrupting chemicals, nonylphenols (NPs) and bisphenol A (BPA), to the embryonic development of the abalone Haliotis diversicolor supertexta, were investigated by the two-stage embryo toxicity test. The 12-h median effective concentrations (EC^sub 50^) of NPs and BPA to the trochophore development were 1016.22 and 30.72 μg L^sup -1^, respectively, and the respective 96-h EC^sub 50^ values based on the completion of metamorphosis (another experimental endpoint) were reduced to 11.65 and 1.02 μg L^sup -1^. Longer exposure time and magnified exposure concentrations in the benthic diatom, that serves as both food source and settlement substrate during the metamorphosis, via bioaccumulation, led to the higher sensitivity of metamorphosis to target EDCs compared with the trochophore development. The hazard concentrations for 5% of the species (HC^sub 5^) could be employed as the safety thresholds for the embryonic development of the abalone. The 12-h HC^sub 5^ values of NPs and BPA were 318.68 and 13.93 μg L^sup -1^, respectively, and the respective 96-h HC^sub 5^ values were 0.99 and 0.18 μg L^sup -1^, which were at environmentally relevant levels. Results of proteomic responses revealed that NPs and BPA altered various functional proteins in the abalone larvae with slight differences between each chemical and affected various physiological functions, such as energy and substance metabolism, cell signalling, formation of cytoskeleton and cilium, immune and stress responses at the same time, leading to the failure of metamorphosis.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Genetic heterogeneity among Eurytemora affinis populations in Western Europe
AN  - 1012237598
AB  - Evolutionary diversification of the broadly distributed copepod sibling species complex Eurytemora affinis has been documented in the northern hemisphere. However, the fine scale geographic distribution, levels of genetic subdivision, evolutionary, and demographic histories of European populations have been less explored. To gain information on genetic subdivision and to evaluate heterogeneity among European populations, we analyzed samples from 8 locations from 58° to 45°N and 0° to 23°E, using 549 base pairs of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene. We discovered three distinct lineages of E. affinis in Western Europe, namely the East Atlantic lineage, the North Sea/English Channel (NSEC) lineage, and the Baltic lineage. These geographically separated lineages showed sequences divergence of 1.7-2.1%, dating back 1.9 million years (CI: 0.9-3.0 My) with no indication of isolation by distance. Genetic divergence in Europe was much lower than among North American lineages. Interestingly, genetic structure varied distinctively among the three lineages: the East Atlantic lineage was divided between the Gironde and the Loire populations, the NSEC lineage comprised one single population unit spanning the Seine, Scheldt and Elbe rivers and the third lineage was restricted to the Baltic Proper (Sweden). We revealed high haplotype diversity in the East Atlantic and the Baltic lineages, whereas in the NSEC lineage haplotype diversity was comparatively low. All three lineages showed signs of at least one demographic expansion event during Pleistocene glaciations that marked their genetic structure. These results provide a preliminary overview of the genetic structure of E. affinis in Europe.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Organic pollutants and ambient severity for the drinking water source of western Taihu Lake
AN  - 872631170; 21503611
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Sharing Knowledge on Environmental Health for Risk Mitigation

              
Measurement of the organic compounds found in western Taihu Lake and evaluation of the ambient severity (AS) of the water using multimedia environmental goals (MEG) was conducted. The comet assay and the antioxidant enzyme approach were used to test the potential toxicity of water samples on the microalgae Euglena gracilis. Total concentrations of 25 organic pollutants in samples from two sites were 6.700 and 14.655 μg/l, respectively, with a calculated total ambient severity (TAS) of less than 1 and therefore minimal risk to human and ecological health. Organic extracts from the samples at these two sites was found to induce dose-dependent DNA damage on microalgae cells. DNA damage together with changes in superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) activities indicated that the potential pollutant toxicity was far higher at one of the two sites than at the other site. The comet assay combined with the activities of antioxidant enzymes may be of value as a biomarker for presence of organic pollutants in drinking water sources.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Hemocitical responses to environmental stress in invertebrates: a review
AN  - 867327158; 20717717
AB  - Although invertebrates are recognized by the great facility to accumulate pollutants present in their environment and many of them are used as sentinel species in biomonitoring studies, little is known about the impact of toxicants on the immune system of these animals. In this regard, hemocytes play a fundamental role: these cells circulate freely through the hemolymph of invertebrates and act on the recognition of foreign material to the organism, mediating and effecting the cellular defense, such as phagocytosis, nodulation, and encapsulation. Different morphological types can be recognized but still there is controversy among the researchers about the exact classification of the hemocytes due to the diversity of techniques for the preservation and observation of these cells. In the present study, a review on the main hemocyte responses to environmental stress in different invertebrate organisms is presented, emphasizing the contamination by heavy metals. It is discussed parameters such as: alteration in the number of cells involved in the defense reaction, phagocytic activity, lysosomal responses, and production of reactive oxygen species.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Effect of salinity on survival and growth of Marphysa sanguinea Montagu (1813) juveniles
AN  - 865134463
AB  - In order to develop rearing techniques for Marphysa sanguinea Montagu (1813), the influence of salinity on survival and growth rates of juveniles has been investigated under controlled laboratory conditions. For this purpose, 720 worms were produced in the laboratory. After rearing up to 6-9 setigerous segments, the worms were subjected to an experimental set-up for 2 months, in which they were exposed to salinities ranging from 15 to 40. For each salinity set-up, two sediment groups were used: an unmodified natural sediment and the same supplemented with Ulva lattuca, an assumed important natural dietary item. The results obtained showed the following: (1) Salinity changes produce an immediate and significant effect on growth; (2) no significant differences were noted between the two groups subjected to different diets, but a significant interaction was noted between each of the two factors. Results of this study can have significant implications for M. sanguinea aquaculture, concerning farm site selection and salinity maintenance in order to maximize commercial productivity.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Effects of microcystin-LR, linear alkylbenzene sulfonate and their mixture on lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) seeds and seedlings
AN  - 864970797; 21409590
AB  - Microcystin-LR (MCLR) and linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS) are present widely in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, but their combined ecotoxicological risk is unknown. This study investigated the toxic effects of MCLR, LAS and their mixture on lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) and evaluated MCLR accumulation level in lettuce with or without LAS. The changes in seed germination and shoot/root growth, responses of the antioxidative defense system, and the accumulation of MCLR in lettuce were tested to evaluate the single and combined toxic effect of MCLR and LAS in well-controlled conditions. The results showed that seedling growth (except for root elongation and leaf weight) was more sensitive to toxicant exposure than seed germination. For seedling leaves, lipid peroxidation was not observed when the antioxidative defense system (including superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione) was activated to relieve the adverse effects of oxidative stress via different pathways. Our results also confirmed that the interaction between MCLR and LAS was synergistic. Both toxicants in combination not only significantly inhibited seedling growth, but also increased the activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase, as well as the contents of glutathione. Furthermore, LAS dramatically enhanced the accumulation of MCLR in the plant, thus leading to a reduction in quality and yield and posing greater potential risk to humans via consumption of these edible plants.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Low exposure levels of urban metals induce heterotrophic community tolerance: a microcosm validation
AN  - 864970721; 21400089
AB  - The biological response of periphyton chronically exposed to metals of urban origin (Cd, Ni and Zn) was investigated with a Pollution-Induced Community Tolerance (PICT) approach using a previously developed short-term toxicity test based on β-glucosidase (heterotrophic) activity. Periphyton was grown on plastic membranes immersed in indoor aquaria contaminated with metals at realistic contamination levels (0.3, 3 μg/l for Cd, 5, 50 μg/l for Ni, 20, 200 μg/l for Zn). After 3 weeks of exposure, biofilms' parameters (dry-weight, chlorophyll a concentration, heterotrophic activity) were analyzed and tolerance acquisition of the heterotrophic communities was assessed using the toxicity test. Modifications of bacterial and eukaryotic community structure were assessed with Automated Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis (ARISA). Effects of metal exposure were observed on biofilms parameters in the Cd and Zn experiments. Tolerance levels increased for both Cd-exposed biofilms, and for the high metal treatment biofilms in the Ni and Zn experiments. Analysis of the ARISA profiles showed that metal exposure affected the structure of both bacterial and eukaryotic communities. Moreover, Cd tolerance of the Zn-exposed heterotrophic communities was evaluated, which showed that the Zn-tolerant community (high metal treatment in the Zn experiment) also became tolerant to Cd (co-tolerance). The study shows that tolerance acquisition can be detected after exposure to environmental metal concentrations using β-glucosidase activity as an endpoint in short-term toxicity tests.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Assessing abalone growth inhibition risk to cadmium and silver by linking toxicokinetics/toxicodynamics and subcellular partitioning
AN  - 864970656; 21437626
AB  - The purpose of this study was to link toxicokinetics/toxicodynamics and subcellular partitioning for assessing the susceptibility and the growth inhibition risks of abalone Haliotis diversicolor supertexta exposed to waterborne and foodborne cadmium (Cd) and silver (Ag). We reanalyzed published data on growth inhibition and subcellular partitioning associated with the present mechanistic model to explore the correlations among elimination (k ^sub e^), detoxification (k ^sub d^), and recovery (k ^sub r^) rate constants and to assess the growth inhibition risk. We found a positive correlation among k ^sub e^, k ^sub d^, and k ^sub r^ in abalone exposed to Ag. We also employed a life-stage based probabilistic assessment model to estimate the growth inhibition risk of abalone to environmentally relevant Cd (5-995 μg l^sup -1^) and Ag (0.05-9.95 μg l^sup -1^) concentrations in Taiwan. The results showed that abalone had a minimum 20% probability of the growth inhibition risk exposed to Cd, whereas Ag exposure was not likely to pose the risk. The maximum biomasses were estimated to be 0.0039 and 0.0038, 61.61 and 43.87, and 98.88 and 62.97 g for larvae, juveniles, and adults of abalone exposed to the same levels of Cd and Ag, respectively. Our study provides a useful tool to detect potential growth biomass of abalone populations subjected to Cd and Ag stresses and mechanistic implications for a long-term ecotoxicological risk assessment in realistic situations.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Long-term dynamics of water-borne nitrogen, phosphorus and suspended solids in the lower Don River basin (Russian Federation)
AN  - 1943054702
AB  - A long-term study (1986-2002) of water-borne nutrient and suspended solids dynamics was undertaken on the lower Don River, which plays an extremely important role in the water supply of the Black Sea and Azov Sea basin. Suspended solids were greatest in spring and summer and were correlated to river discharge. Mean annual nitrogen concentrations increased from 1986 to 1995 and then decreased from 1996 to 2002. Unlike nitrogen, phosphorus concentrations (both phosphates and total phosphorus) gradually increased throughout the study period changing the river from an oligotrophic to upper mesotrophic status. If this trend continues phytoplankton could become nitrogen-limited leading to the development of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterial blooms. No obvious relation between fertiliser usage over the Rostovskaya Oblast and nutrient dynamic patterns was identified, probably because only 10% of the water in the river comes from this area. The reason for the unusual and contradictory nitrogen and phosphorus changes remain largely unknown for this regulated river.

AB  - Upper Miocene Pannonian sediments from Belgrade (Serbia): new evidence and paleoenvironmental considerations

              
The Late Miocene sublittoral marls of the Pannonian Stage (the long-lived Lake Pannon) were studied. From neotectonic point of view, the investigated area represents a natural border between two different morphostructural domains: the Pannonian Basin to the north and the Peri-Pannonian Realm to the south. More than 20 mollusc and 34 ostracod species were identified which indicate the upper part of the Lower Pannonian and the lower part of the Middle Pannonian ("Serbian") predominantly. The identified dinoflagellate cyst assemblage (21 taxa) hinders assignment of the studied samples to a Pannonian substage but supports the high endemism of the Pannonian flora. The lithostratigraphical, paleontological, and paleoecological analyses indicate a mesohaline (8-16 [per thousand]), sublittoral (<90 m deep) environment of the early Lake Pannon. The estimated stratigraphic range for the investigated deposits is 9.8-11.4 Ma.

T1  - Character of Shell Beds Flanking Herod Point Shoal, Southeastern Long Island Sound, New York
AN  - 868512544
AB  - High biogenic productivity, strong tidal currents, shoal topography, and short transport distances combine to favor shell-bed formation along the lower flanks of a cape-associated shoal off Herod Point on Long Island, New York. This shell bed has a densely packed, clast-supported fabric composed largely of undegraded surf clam (Spisula solidissima) valves. It is widest along the central part of the western flank of the shoal where topographic gradients are steep and a stronger flood tide results in residual flow. The bed is narrower and thinner toward the landward margins where currents are too weak to transport larger valves and topographic gradients are gentle, limiting bed-load transport mechanisms by which the shells are concentrated. Reconnaissance mapping off Roanoke Point suggests that shell beds are also present at the other cape-associated shoals off northeastern Long Island, where relatively similar geomorphic and oceanographic conditions exist. These shell beds are important to the Long Island Sound ecosystem because they provide complex benthic habitats of rough and hard substrates at the boundary between the muddy basin floor and mobile sand of the shoals.

T1  - Heritability of heat tolerance in a small livebearing fish, Heterandria formosa
AN  - 863023519; 21373902
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue on Evolutionary Process in Ecotoxicology

              
Climate change is expected to result in an increased occurrence of heat stress. The long-term population-level impact of this stress would be lessened in populations able to genetically adapt to higher temperatures. Adaptation requires the presence of genetically-based variation. At-risk populations may undergo strong declines in population size that lower the amount of genetic variation. The objectives of this study were to quantify the heritability of heat tolerance in populations of the least killifish, Heterandria formosa, and to determine if heritabilities were reduced following a population bottleneck. Heritabilities of heat tolerance were determined for two lines of each of two source populations; two bottlenecked lines (established with one pair of fish) and two regular lines. Heat tolerance was quantified as temperature-at-death (TAD), when fish acclimated at 28°C were subjected to an increase in water temperature of 2°C/day. Mid-parent/mean offspring regressions and full-sib analyses were used to estimate the heritability of TAD. Heritability estimates from parent/offspring regressions ranged from 0.185 to 0.462, while those from sib analyses ranged from 0 to 0.324, with an overall estimate of 0.203 (0.230 for the regular lines, 0.168 for bottlenecked ones). Fish from the bottlenecked line from one source population (but not the other) had a lower heritability than did those from the regular line. These results show that the populations tested had some potential for adaptation to elevated water temperatures, and that this potential may be reduced following a population bottleneck. This should not be construed as evidence that natural populations will not suffer negative consequences from global warming; this study only showed that these specific populations have some potential to adapt under a very specific set of conditions.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Increasing dissolved silica trends in the Rhine River: an effect of recovery from high P loads?
AN  - 857702781
AB  - The development of river dams and further human activities (causing increased nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) nutrient loads), are responsible for a decline in dissolved silica concentrations (DSi) in many river systems. Here, the impact of the reduction of N- and P-concentrations on DSi is examined for the Rhine River. During the last decade of the twentieth century, annual average DSi concentrations increased by ~70% in the Rhine at Bimmen/Lobith, whereas nitrate (NO3) and phosphate (PO^sub 4^) concentrations decreased by approximately one third. Accordingly, decadal changes in nutrient elemental ratios shifted the river system from DSi-limitation to P-limitation. Specifically, a seasonal DSi-concentration increase is observed from May to December for the Rhine River (with exception of June). Observed increases in DSi concentration are probably due to improvements in water-basin and land-use management, specifically a reduction in point-source P discharge, leading to P-limiting conditions for diatom growth. Data of the warm season suggest that as the system is moving through the transition from P-excess to P-limitation conditions, P-limitation according to the elemental ratio DSi/total phosphorus (TP) is occurring later than for the ratio DSi/PO^sub 4^-P. Latter ratio will be buffered around ~16:1 during growing season. Reduction of N fertilization is less relevant, as N-limitation with respect to DSi is not achieved, even at the end of the analyzed period, but N-limitation may be reached in the future. Analysis of discharge-DSi relationship supports the hypothesis that DSi increase is affected by increasing P-limitation during the warm period and not only due to hydrological reasons. Results suggest, however, that the influence of hydrological parameters needs to be addressed in research for DSi concentration changes due to changed nutrient loads. Despite an overall increase in water temperature of 3°C over a 50-year period, no correlation with temperature was found for the last two decades of the twentieth century, for which DSi-data were available. In conclusion, in case of eutrophied river systems with excess of P, P-reduction may lead to an increase of DSi concentrations under certain conditions. This in turn is expected to impact not only DSi-sensitive coastal-zone ecosystems impacted by eutrophication but the carbon cycle as well.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Human health risk assessment of environmental and dietary exposure to natural radionuclides in the Catalan stretch of the Ebro River, Spain
AN  - 854983132; 20556647
AB  - This study was aimed at assessing the levels of ^sup 210^Pb and ^sup 210^Po concentrations as well as gross alpha and beta activities in environmental monitors from the Catalan stretch of the Ebro River (Spain), potentially influenced by the presence of sediments with high concentrations of ^sup 238^U and its decay chain daughters in the Flix reservoir. The chronic daily intake of ^sup 210^Pb and ^sup 210^Po through ingestion and inhalation of soils was evaluated, and the derived non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks were characterized. The low concentration of radioisotopes in soils resulted in a negligible annual effective dose. The levels of ^sup 210^Pb and ^sup 210^Po were determined in various groups of highly consumed food (fish and seafood, vegetables, fruits, and rice), and their dietary intake was calculated. The annual effective dose for the adult people from food intake was estimated in 3.3 × 10^sup -2^ mSv, mostly due to ^sup 210^Po. Overall, the current radioactivity levels in the Catalan stretch of the Ebro River should not mean any additional health risk for the population living nearby. However, an integral assessment of the risks derived from exposure to other pollutants (e.g., metals and organochlorine compounds) jointly with radionuclides could be of great interest.

T1  - The impact of sediment deposition and iceberg scour on the Antarctic soft shell clam Laternula elliptica at King George Island, Antarctica
AN  - 853343912
AB  - Abstract

              
Recent rapid changes of air temperature on the western side of the Antarctic Peninsula results in increased sediment discharge and ice scouring frequencies in coastal regions. These changes are bound to especially affect slow growing, sessile filter feeders such as the Antarctic bivalve, Laternula elliptica, a long-lived and abundant key species with circumpolar distribution. We investigated the effect of sedimentation and ice scouring on small/young and large/old individuals at two closely located stations, distinctly influenced by both types of disturbance. Small individuals dealt better with disturbance in terms of their respiratory response to sediment exposure, reburrowing ability, and survival after injury, compared to larger animals. At the more disturbed station L. elliptica population density was lower, but larger animals reburrowed faster after iceberg disturbance and reduced their metabolic rate under strong sediment coverage, compared to larger animals of the less disturbed station, indicating that an adaptation or learning response to both types of disturbance may be possible. Smaller individuals were not influenced. Laternula elliptica seems capable of coping with the rapidly changing environmental conditions. Due to a decrease in population density and mean population lifespan, L. elliptica could however lose its key role in the bentho-pelagic carbon flux in areas of high sediment deposition.

T1  - Comparative analysis of rotifer community structure in five subtropical shallow lakes in East China: role of physical and chemical conditions
AN  - 816195622
AB  - Worldwide, there have been few comparative studies on rotifer communities in subtropical lakes. We studied changes in rotifer community structure over 1 year and its relationship to several physicochemical variables in five subtropical shallow lakes in East China, covering a nutrient gradient from mesotrophy to moderate eutrophy. In these lakes, the genera Brachionus, Lecane, and Trichocerca dominated the rotifer species composition, and Polyarthra dolichoptera, Keratella cochlearis, Filinia longiseta, T. pusilla, and Anuraeopsis fissa were the dominant species. With increased nutrient loading, total rotifer abundance and species dominance increased, indicating that rotifer abundance might be a more sensitive indicator of trophic state than species composition. Comparative analyses of the six rotifer community indices calculated in this study and redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed that the two slightly eutrophic lakes and the other two moderately eutrophic lakes exhibited a high degree similarity in community structure. This suggests that the trophic state of a lake determines the rotifer community structure. In contrast, in the two moderately eutrophic lakes, the mass ratios of TN:TP and the contents of TP suggested N-limitation and cyanobacteria dominance in phytoplankton communities might be possible. In these lakes TN played a more important role in shaping the rotifer community according to stepwise multiple regression and RDA. RDA analysis also suggested that rotifer species distribution was strongly associated with trophic state and water temperature, with water temperature being the most important factor in determining seasonality.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The watershed approach: Challenges, antecedents, and the transition from technical tool to governance unit
AN  - 1151964139
AB  - Watersheds are a widely accepted scale for water governance activities. This paper makes three contributions to current understandings of watersheds as governance units. First, the paper collects recent research identifying some of the challenges associated with the policy framework understood as the watershed approach. These challenges are boundary choice, accountability, public participation, and watersheds' asymmetries with 'problem-sheds' and 'policy-sheds'. Second, the paper draws upon this synthesis and on a review of the development and evolution of the concept of watersheds to suggest that the challenges associated with the watershed approach are symptoms of a broader issue: that the concept of watersheds was developed as a technical tool but has been taken up as a policy framework. The result of this transition from tool to framework, the paper argues, has been the conflation of governance tools, hydrologic boundaries, and Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM). Third, the paper calls for an analysis of watersheds as separate from the governance tools with which they have been conflated, and presents three entry points into such an analysis.

T1  - Acute and chronic effects of sodium and potassium on the tropical freshwater cladoceran Pseudosida ramosa
AN  - 822712820; 20978846
AB  - In this study, the toxicities of sodium and potassium to the tropical freshwater cladoceran Pseudosida ramosa were assessed. Acute toxicity tests on this species showed that the 48-h LC^sub 50^ of Na^sup +^ was 556 mg l^sup -1^, while that of K^sup +^ was 17.7 mg l^sup -1^. Long-term exposure of female P. ramosa to sodium reduced the total number of survivors from 10 to 6 at a concentration of 249 mg l^sup -1^, 21-day fecundity from 20.4 to 14.3 eggs female^sup -1^ at concentrations ranging from 72 to 249 mg l^sup -1^, 21-day fertility from 20.1 to 6.5 neonates female^sup -1^ at concentrations ranging from 25 to 249 mg l^sup -1^. Furthermore, fecundity of each brood from the second to the fifth was significantly lower at 249 mg l^sup -1^ and fertility of each brood from the first to the fifth at concentrations ranging from 25 to 249 mg l^sup -1^. A significant decrease in fertility was associated with an increase in the number of aborted eggs. Long-term exposure to potassium decreased the 21-day fecundity of P. ramosa from 14.2 to 10.8 eggs female^sup -1^ at a concentration of 11 mg l^sup -1^ and fertility (fourth brood only) at 6.2 and 11 mg l^sup -1^. Tropical reservoirs located near areas where the soil is overloaded with fertilizers and ferti-irrigation with vinasse already show concentrations of Na^sup +^ and K^sup +^ very close to those producing sub-lethal long-term effects on P. ramosa. A possible consequence is that organisms of the aquatic biota cannot adapt and freshwater taxa may become locally extinct, transferring dominance to salt-tolerant taxa.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Effects of sublethal copper exposure on two gammarid species: which is the best competitor?
AN  - 822712802; 21113796
AB  - Biomarker responses in organisms exposed to copper were examined by comparing two gammarid species, Gammarus roeseli and Dikerogammarus villosus, based on gender. G. roeseli specimens were exposed to 20 μg/L of copper for 6, 12, 24 and 48-h periods, while D. villosus were exposed to 20 and 30 μg/L of copper for 12, 48 and 72 h. Males and females of each species were exposed separately and biomarker measurements were performed for each species and gender. The selected biomarkers were antioxidant enzymes as total glutathione peroxidase (GPxtot), selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase (SeGPx), and catalase activities. Malondialdehyde level (MDA) was measured as a biomarker of toxic effect. Energy reserves were evaluated by means of lipid, glycogen and protein levels. For both species and gender, antioxidant enzyme activities were weakly modified by copper exposure and differences were transient. MDA levels were increased in both species and genders in exposed animals compared to controls, when energy reserves were decreased. G. roeseli was more rapidly overwhelmed by copper toxicity while the first response of D. villosus was the mobilization of its energetic content. D. Villosus probably has specific physiological properties that enable it to cope with copper toxicity and thus become the best competitor.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Relative sensitivity of fish and mammalian cells to the antibiotic, trimethoprim: cytotoxic and genotoxic responses as determined by neutral red retention, Comet and micronucleus assays
AN  - 822712642; 21104197
AB  - Relative cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of a widely used antibiotic, trimethoprim (TRIMP) was evaluated under in vitro conditions using rainbow trout gonad-2 (RTG-2) and Chinese hamster ovary-K1 (CHO-K1) cells. Whilst cytotoxicity was determined using neutral red retention (NRR) assay, the genotoxicity was determined using single cell gel electrophoresis or the Comet assay and cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay. For NRR assay, concentration-dependent cytotoxic effect was observed for both the cell lines (estimated EC^sub 50^ values: 671.82 ± 21.78 and 611.6 ± 20.4 μg ml^sup -1^ for RTG-2 and CHO-K1 cells, respectively). There was no statistically significant difference between the two cell lines for this assay. For the Comet assay, standard 6 h exposure to TRIMP did not show any positive response for any of the cell types used. However, 48 h exposure to RTG-2 cells showed a concentration-dependent induction of DNA damage (r = 0.86). The highest concentration of TRIMP used (i.e. 100 μg ml^sup -1^) showed relatively higher DNA damage, compared to ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS; 1 μg ml^sup -1^ or 8 mM), a reference genotoxic agent, used concurrently. In contrast, 24 h exposure time for CHO-K1 cells did not show any concentration-dependent increase for this assay. For MN assay, a significant correlation was found between the MN induction and TRIMP concentration for both the cell lines (RTG-2: r = 0.68; CHO-K1: r = 0.79), although only the highest concentration used showed a significant increase for binucleated (BN) cell with micronuclei (BNMN). The study suggests that whilst the cells of different origin could exhibit similar cytotoxicity, they could display differential genotoxic effects. Furthermore, genotoxic effects of TRIMP are primarily exposure period dependent phenomena and, in addition to inhibiting the action of dihydrofolate reductase, oxidative stress could also contribute for the observed toxic effects, fish cells in general being more sensitive for genotoxic effects.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Egg thiamine concentration affects embryo survival in Lake Erie walleye
AN  - 816190871
AB  - We quantified thiamine in eggs of Lake Erie walleye to determine if differences exist between spawning stocks within the Maumee and Sandusky rivers, both of which drain into the Western Basin. In spring 2004, eggs of walleye were collected in the Maumee River at three occasions (early, peak and late of the spawning run) and in the Sandusky River during the spawning run. After collection, eggs were fertilized with a known amount of milt, incubated and embryo survival was determined at the pigmented eyed stage. Thiamine and its derivatives were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography. Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) was the most abundant form of vitamin B^sub 1^ present in eggs (60-95% of the total vitamin B^sub 1^ concentration). Total thiamine concentrations in walleye eggs from the Maumee and Sandusky rivers at the peak of the spawning run averaged 6.1±1.6 nmolg^sup -1^ and 5.0±2.9 nmolg^sup -1^, respectively. Our results also indicated that Maumee River stock survival to the eyed stage embryo declined as the spawning season progressed (72%, 59% and 37% in the early, middle and late of spawning run, respectively) as well as the total thiamine and TPP concentrations. At the peak of the spawning run, survival to the eyed stage embryo did not differ significantly between stocks 59% versus 65% in the Maumee and Sandusky rivers, respectively, and thiamine concentrations were not significantly different between sites.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Hydrologic and biogeochemical functioning of intensively managed catchments: A synthesis of top-down analyses
AN  - 1115886098
AB  - This paper synthesizes a 3-year collaborative effort to characterize the biogeochemical and hydrological features of intensively managed agricultural catchments by combining data analysis, modeling, and preliminary hypothesis testing. The specific focus was on the Midwestern region of the United States. The results suggest that: (1) water management, specifically the homogenization of evapotranspiration losses driven by mono-cultural vegetation cover, and the homogenization of runoff generation driven by artificial drainage, has created engineered, predictable hydrologic systems; (2) nutrient and pesticide management, specifically their regular applications have created two kinds of biogeochemical export regimes: chemostatic (low variability in concentration as exhibited by nitrate) and episodic (high variability in concentration as exhibited by pesticides); (3) coupled mass-balance models for water and solutes reproduce these two regimes as a function of chemical rate constants. Phosphorus transport regimes were found to be episodic at smaller spatial scales, but chemostatic at larger scales. Chemostatic response dominates in transport-limited catchments that have internal sources of the solute to buffer the periodicity in episodic inputs, while episodic response dominates in source-limited catchments. The shift from episodic nitrate export in pristine catchments to chemostatic regimes in managed watersheds was attributed to legacy stores of nitrogen (built from continued fertilizer applications) that buffer interannual variations in biogeochemical processing. Fast degradation kinetics of pesticides prevents the build-up of legacy sources, and leads to episodic export. Analytical expressions were derived for the probability density functions of solute delivery ratio as a function of the stochastics of rainfall-runoff events and biogeochemical controls.

T1  - An Impact Assessment Method of Dam/Sluice on Instream Ecosystem and its Application to the Bengbu Sluice of China
AN  - 807509311
AB  - A method is presented for impact evaluation of dams/sluices on their downstream aquatic ecosystems in the absence of detailed long-sequence ecology ecosystem data. It is based on the analysis of relations between indices of water quality and aquatic organisms. It can be applied to a river section absent of long-sequence ecology ecosystem data. For this study it was used to evaluate the effects of the Bengbu Sluice (BS), a typical sluice in the Huai River in China. Results indicate that in April and May the impact of BS on different downstream aquatic organisms varied. The most significant impact was on phytoplankton, with 91.7% of phytoplankton indices showing a 100% increase in quantity and biomass. The second most significant was on zooplankton, with 60.0% of zooplankton showing greater increase in quantity and biomass. The least significant impact was on zoobenthos, with only 33.3% showing greater increase in quantity and biomass. Most of these organisms have higher pollution-resistibility. These findings suggest that the present operation scheme will gradually lead to biodiversity decrease in the downstream aquatic ecology system, which will harm the instream aquatic ecology. Overall, BS has a negative impact on the downstream aquatic ecology system. It is argued that, in order to reduce the negative impact on the downstream aquatic ecology system, the operation of BS needs to be improved so that the discharge into the downstream river course is increased. Data comparison of the aquatic ecosystem condition between 1982 and 2006 also demonstrates the decreasing aquatic ecosystem quality downstream of BS.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Biogeochemical implications of climate change for tropical rivers and floodplains
AN  - 756353950
AB  - Large rivers of the tropics, many of which have extensive floodplains and deltas, are important in the delivery of nutrients and sediments to marine environments, in methane emission to the atmosphere and in providing ecosystem services associated with their high biological productivity. These ecosystem functions entail biogeochemical processes that will be influenced by climate change. Evidence for recent climate-driven changes in tropical rivers exists, but remains equivocal. Model projections suggest substantial future climate-driven changes, but they also underscore the complex interactions that control landscape water balances, river discharges and biogeochemical processes. The most important changes are likely to involve: (1) aquatic thermal regimes, with implications for thermal optima of plants and animals, rates of microbially mediated biogeochemical transformations, density stratification of water bodies and dissolved oxygen depletion; (2) hydrological regimes of discharge and floodplain inundation, which determine the ecological structure and function of rivers and floodplains and the extent and seasonality of aquatic environments; and (3) freshwater-seawater gradients where rivers meet oceans, affecting the distribution of marine, brackish and freshwater environments and the biogeochemical processing as river water approaches the coastal zone. In all cases, climate change affects biogeochemical processes in concert with other drivers such as deforestation and other land use changes, dams and other hydrological alterations and water withdrawals. Furthermore, changes in riverine hydrology and biogeochemistry produce potential feedbacks to climate involving biogeochemical processes such as decomposition and methane emission. Future research should seek improved understanding of these changes, and long-term monitoring should be extended to shallow waters of wetlands and floodplains in addition to the larger lakes and rivers that are most studied.

T1  - Linking behavioural alterations with biomarkers responses in the European seabass Dicentrarchus labrax L. exposed to the organophosphate pesticide fenitrothion
AN  - 807574459; 20686920
AB  - The acute effects of the organophosphate insecticide fenitrothion on Dicentrarchus labrax juveniles were investigated through a bioassay using biomarkers and swimming behaviour as effect criteria. After 96 h of exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of fenitrothion, the swimming velocity and several biomarkers were individually determined, namely: brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity; muscle cholinesterases (ChE), lactate dehydrogenase and isocitrate dehydrogenase activities; liver ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), glutathione S-transferases, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities and lipid peroxidation levels (LPO). A significant decrease of the swimming velocity (LOEC = 2 mg l^sup -1^), an inhibition of both AChE (LOEC = 0.06 mg l^sup -1^) and ChE activities (LOEC = 0.03 mg l^sup -1^), and a positive and significant correlation between the swimming velocity and AChE were found in exposed fish, suggesting an influence of the inhibition of these enzymes in the swimming velocity decrease. An increase of EROD activity (LOEC = 1 mg l^sup -1^), indicating the involvement of this enzyme in fenitrothion biotransformation, and a negative and significant correlation between EROD activity and swimming velocity were also found, suggesting that the two findings may somehow be related. Furthermore, results show a significant induction of SOD (LOEC = 0.13 mg l^sup -1^) without LPO increase, suggesting that the enzyme is preventing oxidative stress damage. No significant alterations were found in any of the other parameters tested. Thus, exposure of seabass to fenitrothion in the wild at concentrations similar to those tested here may have adverse consequences at population level as neurotransmission and swimming ability are essential for fish performance and survival.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Evaluation of the potential of the common cockle (Cerastoderma edule L.) for the ecological risk assessment of estuarine sediments: bioaccumulation and biomarkers
AN  - 807571285; 20717720
AB  - Common cockles (Cerastoderma edule, L. 1758, Bivalvia: Cardiidae) were subjected to a laboratory assay with sediments collected from distinct sites of the Sado Estuary (Portugal). Cockles were obtained from a mariculture site of the Sado Estuary and exposed through 28-day, semi-static, assays to sediments collected from three sites of the estuary. Sediments from these sites revealed different physico-chemical properties and levels of metals and organic contaminants, ranging from unimpacted (the reference site) to moderately impacted, when compared to available sediment quality guidelines. Cockles were surveyed for bioaccumulation of trace elements (Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Cd and Pb) and organic contaminants (PAHs, PCBs and DDTs). Two sets of potential biomarkers were employed to assess toxicity: whole-body metallothionein (MT) induction and digestive gland histopathology. The bioaccumulation factor and the biota-to-soil accumulation factor were estimated as ecological indices of exposure to metals and organic compounds. From the results it is inferred that C. edule responds to sediment-bound contamination and might, therefore, be suitable for biomonitoring. The species was found capable to regulate and eliminate both types of contaminants. Still, the sediment contamination levels do not account for all the variation in bioaccumulation and MT levels, which may result from the moderate metal concentrations found in sediments, the species' intrinsic resistance to pollution and from yet unexplained xenobiotic interaction effects.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Selenium detected in fish otoliths: a novel tracer for a polluted lake?
AN  - 807482518
AB  - To test if otoliths can be used to track fish migration in polluted areas, fish sampled from Onondaga Lake, heavily polluted with mercury, were used in an assay to determine whether mercury was detectable in the fishes' otoliths using synchrotron-based scanning X-ray fluorescence microscopy (SXFM). Mercury was undetectable, but selenium, rarely reported in otoliths and known as a physiological antagonist to mercury, was. Strontium was also present but appeared to be taken up independently of selenium, and thus these serve as independent biogeochemical markers. Both selenium and mercury were detected in fish tissues, but selenium was below levels considered toxic. Selenium was low in otoliths of fishes collected in nearby Oneida Lake. Synoptic surveys of water chemistry revealed that Se is regionally highest in Onondaga Lake and in particular its main inlet, Onondaga Creek. SXFM appears to be a sensitive method for detecting selenium in otoliths. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Quantification of the energy required for the destruction of Balanus amphitrite larva by ultrasonic treatment
AN  - 756404019
AB  - Ultrasonic treatment, a relatively less explored technology in water disinfection, was used to quantify the energy required for the destruction of larvae of barnacle Balanus amphitrite, which is a major marine fouling and a potential invasive organism. Since the power used and treatment time for disinfection are economically, and practically, the most important parameters, the energy required to pulverize the larvae into pieces ≤30 µm was determined as a function of the acoustic power density. The present investigation suggests that an ultrasonic system operating at 20 kHz and 0.0975 W/cm3 can effectively pulverize barnacle larvae having length (~440 µm) and breadth (~350 µm) within 45 seconds using 0.1 mJ/larva of pulverization energy. It was also observed that following pulverization of the larvae, the bacterial abundance increased and the rate of release of bacteria was dependent on power level and treatment time, which in turn decided the pulverization rate and hence the rate of release of bacteria.

T1  - Repeatability of physiological traits in juvenile Pacific abalone, Haliotis discus hannai
AN  - 756005530
AB  - Several studies on individual physiological traits assume that past records may predict future performance. Marine mollusks, as other animals, show a wide range of between- and within-individual variation of physiological traits. However, in this group, almost nothing is known about the relative influence of genetic factors on that variation. Repeatability (R) is a measure of the consistency of the variation of a trait, which includes its genetic variance and represents the maximum potential value of its heritability (h^sup 2^). Traits that show high inter-individual variation and high repeatability levels could potentially evolve through selection (natural or artificial). We estimated the repeatability [using intra-class (τ) and Pearson-moment (r) correlation coefficients] of several physiological traits related to energy acquisition and allocation in juvenile Pacific abalone Haliotis discus hannai, maintained under controlled environment growing systems. In order to estimate the range of the R values and the effect of the time elapsed between measurements on these estimates, we measured these traits monthly during 6 months for each individual. Among the physiological traits, those related to energy allocation like oxygen consumption (standard metabolic rate, SMR) and ammonium excretion rates, and oxygen/nitrogen ratio (O/N), showed intermediate levels of repeatability (0.48, 0.55 and 0.39, respectively), when this was estimated by τ coefficient. However, the r estimation showed that SMR and O/N repeatability were significant and high (0.6-0.7 and 0.5-0.7, respectively) during the first 5 consecutive measurements, decreasing strongly (0.3 and 0.2, respectively) during the last measurement. For ammonia excretion, although repeatability (r) decreased from 0.8 to 0.5 during the 6 consecutive measurements, they remain significant during the experimental period. Therefore, our results indicate that for H. discus hannai juveniles, physiological traits like SMR, ammonia excretion and O/N are significantly repeatable (i.e. good predictors of future measurements) during a period of 4-5 months. These significant repeatability values suggest an important genetic control upon the phenotypic variation of these physiological traits, and could potentially respond to natural or artificial selection, and be used in genetic improvement programs. By contrast, those traits related to energy acquisition (i.e. ingestion, absorption and assimilation) and physiological efficiencies (i.e. net growth and scope for growth) showed very low levels of repeatability (0-0.07). This indicates that the phenotypic variation of these traits would be more influenced by environment rather than by genetic factors. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Toxic effects of molluscicidal baits to the terrestrial isopod Porcellionides pruinosus (Brandt, 1833)
AN  - 753819536
AB  - Methiocarb and metaldehyde are the most common molluscicides applied in agricultural and horticultural fields in Portugal and elsewhere in Europe. The application of molluscicidal baits to control slug and snail populations can pose a threat to non-target organisms like terrestrial isopods, because they are detritivorous and may feed on the toxic baits applied to the soil surface. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effects and understand the modes of action of these molluscicides to terrestrial isopods.

              
In this study, the terrestrial isopod Porcellionides pruinosus was exposed to these two molluscicides, and the time to lethality was evaluated. Biochemical indicators (biomarkers) are known to provide early warning signs of environmental pollution or stress conditions to the organisms, by measuring cellular or molecular responses of the target organism to xenobiotic agents. Therefore, to evaluate modes of action and effects and also to see if biomarkers can be used as early warning tools in molluscicidal exposures, three different enzymes, glutathione S-transferase (GST), acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and catalase (CAT), were analysed upon single exposures and binary mixtures tests.

              
These two molluscicides showed to be of extreme concern regarding terrestrial isopods, as all animals died after 24 h of exposure to methiocarb, and only 20% survived after 56 h of exposure to metaldehyde. Results indicate that the carbamate methiocarb inhibited significantly AChE activity, but no effects were observed in CAT and GST levels. The exposure to metaldehyde had no effects on AChE, but a decrease in GST activity as well as a general increase in CAT activity was observed at the higher exposure period tested (32 h). The combined exposure of the two molluscicides resulted in a general decrease in AChE and CAT activity, but no visible effects were observed in terms of GST activity.

              
The LT50 values found in the single exposures to both molluscicides were very low, especially in the case of the carbamate methiocarb. The use of several biomarkers was a suitable tool to understand the mode of action of these two molluscicides in this isopod species. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Predicting bioavailability and bioaccumulation of arsenic by freshwater clam Corbicula fluminea using valve daily activity
AN  - 750269035; 19847660
AB  - There are many bioindicators. However, it remains largely unknown which metal-bioindicator systems will give the reasonable detection ranges of bioavailable metals in the aquatic ecosystem. Various experimental data make the demonstration of biomonitoring processes challenging. Ingested inorganic arsenic is strongly associated with a wide spectrum of adverse health outcomes. Freshwater clam Corbicula fluminea, one of the most commonly used freshwater biomomitoring organisms, presents daily activity in valve movement and demonstrates biotic uptake potential to accumulate arsenic. Here, a systematical way was provided to dynamically link valve daily activity in C. fluminea and arsenic bioavailability and toxicokinetics to predict affinity at arsenic-binding site in gills and arsenic body burden. Using computational ecotoxicology methods, a valve daily rhythm model can be tuned mathematically to the responsive ranges of valve daily activity system in response to varied bioavailable arsenic concentration. The patterned response then can be used to predict the site-specific bioavailable arsenic concentration at the specific measuring time window. This approach can yield predictive data of results from toxicity studies of specific bioindicators that can assist in prediction of risk for aquatic animals and humans. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Butyltin contamination in sediments and seawater from Kaohsiung Harbor, Taiwan
AN  - 750268968; 19779842
AB  - The distribution of butyltin (BT) compounds in the sediments and seawater, at the river outfalls, fishing ports, shipyards, and industrial zone docks of Kaohsiung Harbor, Taiwan were investigated. Twenty sediment and seawater samples were collected from various locations in the Harbor in 2006 and analyzed for monobutyltin (MBT), dibutyltin (DBT), and tributyltin (TBT). Results showed that the concentration of total BTs varied from 1.5 to 151 ng/g in sediment samples, with TBT being the major component of the sediment samples. This suggests that sediments could be the most possible sink of TBT brought by the sorption mechanism. The concentrations of BTs ranged from 9.7 to 270 ng/L in seawater samples, whereas DBT and MBT, the degradation byproducts of TBT, were mainly the most abundant BT compounds of the seawater samples. This indicates that the abiotic or biotic degradation potential of TBT was significant. Spatially, the highest concentrations of BTs were observed in both water and sediment samples collected from the shipyard and fishing port areas. This indicates that the shipping-related activities (e.g., navigation, ship repair, and ship building) would contribute most of BTs in the environment. Results show that the concentrations of degradation products (DBT and MBT) were related closely to temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen (DO), and chlorophyll-a of the seawater. This implies that seasonal changes of the water parameters controlled the degradation of TBT in seawater. The observed levels of BT compounds in both seawater and sediments were much higher than those required to induce toxic effects on marine organisms, suggesting that appropriate TBT control strategies should be taken in Kaohsiung Harbor.

T1  - Cadmium, lead and their mixtures with copper: Paracentrotus lividus embryotoxicity assessment, prediction, and offspring quality evaluation
AN  - 1516801060; 20552397
AB  - The aim of this research was to assess the combined effects of three heavy metals (copper, lead, cadmium) on the fertilization and offspring quality of the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus at EC50, NOEL, and EC1 concentrations. The observed data were compared with the predictions derived from approaches of Concentration Addition (CA) and Independent Action (IA) in order to evaluate the proper prediction of the observed mixture toxic effect. The P. lividus embryotoxicity of trace metals decreases as follows: Cu > Pb > Cd at all toxicity concentration tested. EC50 mixture revealed less toxic only than Cu; EC50 was 0.80 (±0.07) mg/l, the offspring malformations were mainly P1 type (skeletal alterations) up to 20% mixture concentration, and P2 type from 70% concentration. The NOEL and EC1 mixtures evidenced that all compounds contribute to the overall toxicity, even if present at low concentrations: the former EC50 was 0.532 (±0.058) mg/l and the latter was 1.081 (±0.240) mg/l. The developmental defects observed were mainly P1 type in both mixtures. Both CA and IA models did not accurately predict mixture toxicity for EC50 and NOEL mixtures. Instead, EC1 mixture effects seemed well represented by the IA model. The protective action of the CA model, although quite accurate when applied to simple biological systems like algae and bacteria, but failed to represent the worst-case in this study with more complex organisms. It would be useful to introduce in the models one or more factors that take into account the complexity of these biological systems.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Sublethal and sex-specific cypermethrin effects in toxicity tests with the midge Chironomus riparius Meigen
AN  - 1516800992; 20526673
AB  - We quantified sublethal and sex-specific cypermethrin effects in experiments (29 days) with the midge Chironomus riparius at different levels of sediment organic matter content (0, 5, and 20%). We found highly significant effects of cypermethrin concentrations and sediment type on emergence, mean development rate, and adult size. For example, emergence/survival rates were 70-100% below 0.8 [mu]g/l and unaffected by organic matter content. At 3.2 [mu]g/l, however, no larvae survived in sediment without organic matter, but survival successively increased to 26 ± 11% in sediment with 20% organic matter. Mean development rates were always higher for males than for females, and significant differences between sexes occurred consistently in controls and in treatments with our lowest concentration of 0.05 [mu]g/l. Sex-specific differences in mean development rate decreased across the cypermethrin gradient, suggesting that male development was affected more than that of females at similar concentrations. We also found an increase in adult size across the concentration gradient in sediments lacking organic matter and suggest an increased feeding activity due to sublethal toxic stress as a probable causal mechanism. We speculate that the observed sex-specific effects on development rates and adult size can have strong repercussions on emergence timing and fecundity, respectively.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Roach (Rutilus rutilus) reproductive cycle: a study of biochemical and histological parameters in a low contaminated site
AN  - 872170167; 19680761
AB  - Fish reproduction is subjected to worrying trends in many aquatic environments. In this study, we report the absence of histological and biochemical alterations in fish sampled in a low contaminated site (characterised by the absence of detectable oestrogenic activity and mutagenicity in sediment extracts). A total of 474 roach (Rutilus rutilus) were monthly sampled during 18 months, and no intersex fish were recorded after careful histological examination, thus indicating that the incidence of this phenomenon may be very low under natural conditions. Furthermore, mean male plasma vitellogenin concentration was 24 ng ml^sup -1^ and was only slightly elevated during the spawning period (up to 120 ng ml^sup -1^) indicating that these low values may be characteristic of a low contaminated site. Of the male roach, 45.3% were sampled, a sex-ratio that did not significantly deviated from the expected 1:1 ratio between male and female. Results also showed that natural conditions can greatly affect the reproductive cycle of roach. Gametogenesis showed a biphasic pattern with first gonad maturation between September and December and a final maturation occurring at the end of winter/early spring. Under decreasing temperatures, particularly below 6°C, gametogenesis was stopped or even regressed with secondary oocytes becoming rare under histological observation. Conversely, elevated temperatures during the winter lead to an earlier gonad maturation.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Optimal ballast water exchange sequence design using symmetrical multitank strategy
AN  - 755011082
AB  - The quality of the ballast water exchange scheme affects many aspects of a ship, including intact stability, structural strength, building and operational expenses, etc. This paper focuses on developing an optimization methodology for large-scale sequential ballast water exchange. The method of transversely symmetrical ballast water tanks being exchanged simultaneously is adopted, and the potentials of multiple tanks being exchanged at a time are explored. The mathematical model for the symmetrical ballast water exchange problem is built by minimizing the occurred maximum trims, maximum hull girder bending moments, and shearing forces as objectives, and the related safety assessment criteria as constraints. A multiobjective genetic algorithm with some operators specially designed for the problem is presented to obtain a set of approximate Pareto-optimal solutions for engineers to choose from. Finally, a real case study on the symmetrical ballast water exchange of a 176,000 DWT bulk carrier is conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Abundance and ecological significance of the clam Rangia cuneata (Sowerby, 1831) in the upper Barataria Estuary (Louisiana, USA)
AN  - 504009915
AB  - We proposed that Rangia cuneata (Sowerby, 1831) is an important estuarine bivalve with ecological significance in three coastal lakes in Barataria Bay, Gulf of Mexico--Lake Cataouatche, Lake Salvador and Lac des Allemands. Our goals were to determine the abundance and distribution of Rangia in these lakes and to measure clearance times to elucidate its potential impacts on phytoplankton communities. The estimated average densities of R. cuneata in Lake Cataouatche, Lake Salvador, and Lac des Allemands were 63, 157, and 107 individuals m^sup -2^, respectively, which is 30% lower than that observed in nearby Lake Pontchartrain. The size of clams in Lake Salvador was between 4 and 50 mm, while individuals in Lake Cataouatche and Lac des Allemands were mostly >20 mm. We postulate that a relatively infrequent large tropical storm transported the larvae from Lake Salvador to the other two lakes 1 year before our sampling to create this size difference. The clams were up to 99.9% of the total benthic biomass in Lake Salvador, 15.9% in Lake Cataouatche, and 40.0% in Lac des Allemands. The R. cuneata biomass values were between 16.2 and 27.6 g m^sup -2^ and the clearance times were 1.0-1.5 days. The clearance times are among the highest previously reported for coastal bivalve communities, which were from cooler climates. The results demonstrate that Rangia can be a critical part of the ecological processes in shallow water systems of the Gulf of Mexico. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Seasonally resolved growth of freshwater bivalves determined by oxygen and carbon isotope shell chemistry
AN  - 861132295
AB  - By means of a monitoring experiment in two rivers in the Netherlands, we establish a relationship between seasonally resolved growth rates in unionid freshwater bivalves and their environment. We reconstructed these seasonally resolved growth rates by using relationships of stable isotopes in the shells and their ambient river water. The reconstructed growth rates reveal that shells grow fastest in spring-early summer, when highest food availability occurs in the rivers. In addition, the reconstructed growth rates show that onset and cessation of growth are mainly influenced by water temperature.

T1  - Potential of [delta]13C and [delta]15N of cladoceran subfossil exoskeletons for paleo-ecological studies
AN  - 633622756
AB  - Stable isotope analyses on cladoceran subfossil exoskeletons retrieved from sediment cores could allow the reconstruction of past changes in lake food webs provided the [delta]^sup 13^C and [delta]^sup 15^N values of the exoskeletons reflect those of the organisms' whole body. The relationships between the C and N stable isotope compositions of the exoskeletons and those of the whole body were investigated for two freshwater cladoceran taxa (Bosmina sp. and Daphnia sp.) from modern samples. The C and N stable isotope compositions of the exoskeleton and those of the whole body were strongly correlated. Exoskeleton [delta]^sup 13^C was similar to the whole body [delta]^sup 13^C for both taxa. Daphnia exoskeletons were strongly depleted in ^sup 15^N (-7.9[per thousand]) compared to the whole body. Stable isotope analyses were thereafter performed on cladoceran remains from five downcore samples from Lake Annecy, France. Results showed that Bosmina [delta]^sup 15^N values increased by more than 4[per thousand], between the early twentieth and twenty first centuries. Such changes might be the result of changes in nitrogen sources or cycling in the lake and/or of major shifts in Bosmina trophic position within the lake food web. This study sets up the potential of stable isotope analyses performed on cladoceran subfossil remains for paleo-ecological purposes. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Marine Glycobiology: Current Status and Future Perspectives
AN  - 346946643; 20390314
AB  - Glycobiology, which is the study of the structure and function of carbohydrates and carbohydrate containing molecules, is fundamental to all biological systems. Progress in glycobiology has shed light on a range of complex biological processes associated with, for example, disease and immunology, molecular and cellular communication, and developmental biology. There is an established, if rather modest, tradition of glycobiology research in marine systems that has primarily focused on reproduction, biofouling, and chemical communication. The current status of marine glycobiology research is primarily descriptive with very limited progress on structural elucidation and the subsequent definition of precise functional roles beyond a small number of classical examples, e.g., induction of the acrosome reaction in echinoderms. However, with recent advances in analytical instrumentation, there is now the capacity to begin to characterize marine glycoconjugates, many of which will have potential biomedical and biotechnological applications. The analytical approach to glycoscience has developed to such an extent that it has acquired its own "-omics" identity. Glycomics is the quest to decipher the complex information conveyed by carbohydrate molecules--the carbohydrate code or glycocode. Due to the paucity of structural information available, this article will highlight the fundamental importance of glycobiology for many biological processes in marine organisms and will draw upon the best defined systems. These systems therefore may prove genuine candidates for full carbohydrate characterization.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Plankton dynamics along a 180 km reach of the Saint Lawrence River from its headwaters in Lake Ontario
AN  - 304764999
AB  - We test the hypothesis that phytoplankton biomass decrease upon entry into the St. Lawrence River from headwaters in Lake Ontario is attributable to a range of causal factors including, decreased photosynthetic fitness due to turbulence, cell loss due to increased flocculation and subsequent sedimentation, decreases in nutrients, and loss due to grazing. In order to test this, changes in phytoplankton and crustacean zooplankton concentrations were examined during four transects along the river, from 8 km offshore in Lake Ontario to the hydroelectric power dam 180 km downstream. Both phytoplankton biomass, measured as chlorophyll-a, and zooplankton decreased markedly upon entry of lake water into the river. Phytoplankton community composition and size changed little over the river reach and tended to reflect that in Lake Ontario. Total phosphorus increased with transit of river water downstream despite low tributary inputs of water into this reach of river. Light availability was high, photosynthetic efficiency suggested that phytoplankton were not physiologically stressed during transit in turbulent waters, and there was no direct evidence of flocculation causing sedimentation of phytoplankton. Grazing by the benthic community (filtering insect larvae and dreissenid mussels) is inferred to be a dominant biological factor as is the geomorphology in this reach of the river, which includes large littoral areas, shoals, and reaches of high water velocity that can increase particle contact in the water column with benthic grazers. The findings of this study have a bearing on understanding how changing water levels in a regulated river might alter areas of benthic grazing. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Survival, growth and immune activity of scallop Chlamys farreri cultured at different depths in Haizhou Bay (Yellow Sea, China) during hot season
AN  - 312776697
AB  - Survival, growth and immune response of the scallop, Chlamys farreri, cultured in lantern nets at five different depths (2, 5, 10, 15, and 20 m below the sea surface) were studied in Haizhou Bay during the hot season (summer and autumn) of 2007. Survival and growth rates were quantified bimonthly. Immune activities in hemolymph (superoxide dismutase (SOD) and acid phosphatase (ACP)) were measured to evaluate the health of scallops at the end of the study. Environmental parameters at the five depths were also monitored during the experiment. Mortalities mainly occurred during summer. Survival of scallops suspended at 15 m (78.0%) and 20 m (86.7%) was significantly higher than at 2 m (62.9%), 5 m (60.8%) or 10 m (66.8%) at the end of the study. Mean shell height grew significantly faster at 10 m (205.0 mcm/d) and 20 m (236.9 mcm/d) than at 2, 5 or 15 m in summer (July 9 to September 1); however, shell growth rate at 20 m was significantly lower than at the other four depths in autumn (September 2 to November 6). In contrast to summer, scallops at 5 m grew faster (262.9 mcm/d) during autumn. The growth of soft tissue at different depths showed a similar trend to the shell. Growth rates of shell height and soft tissue were faster in autumn than in summer, with the exception of shell height at 20 m. SOD activity of scallops increased with depth, and ACP activity was significantly higher at 15 and 20 m than at other depths, which suggests that scallops were healthier near the bottom. Factors explaining the depth-related mortality and growth of scallops are also discussed. We conclude that the mass mortality of scallop, C. farreri, during summer can be prevented by moving the culture area to deeper water and yield can be maximized by suspending the scallops in deep water during summer and then transferring them to shallow water in autumn.

T1  - Effects of dietary calcium and phosphorus supplementation on the growth performance of juvenile spotted babylon Babylonia areolata culture in a recirculating culture system
AN  - 871220335
AB  - A feeding experiment was conducted to determine the effects of dietary calcium and phosphorus, and the interaction between calcium and phosphorus, on the growth of juvenile spotted babylon, Babylonia areolata, cultured in a recirculating culture system. Nine isonitrogenous experimental diets supplemented with three levels of calcium (1, 4, and 7%) for each of three levels of phosphorus (1, 3, and 5%) were prepared using fish meal, squid meal, and shrimp meal as the main protein sources. Juveniles with an initial average body weight of 0.59 ± 0.09 g were fed to satiation once daily with one of the nine diets for 180 days. Absolute and specific growth rates were calculated for both shell length and whole wet body weight. Results showed that dietary calcium and phosphorus supplementation significantly affected the growth of juvenile spotted babylon (P < 0.05), but not survival and feed-conversion ratio. The specific growth rate in shell length (SGRL) ranged from 0.32 to 0.39% day^sup -1^. No significant difference among phosphorus levels and no significant interaction between calcium and phosphorus in SGRL of the spotted babylon (P > 0.05) was found, but significant differences were observed among calcium levels, irrespective of phosphorus levels (P < 0.05). For 1 and 7% supplemental calcium, the spotted babylon had significantly higher SGRL than those fed diets supplemented with 4% calcium. However, the specific growth rate in body weight (SGRW) ranged from 0.91 to 1.19% day^sup -1^ with no significant difference among calcium and phosphorus levels and no significant interaction between calcium and phosphorus (P > 0.05). Survival and feed-conversion ratio were not significantly affected by dietary calcium and phosphorus levels with ranges from 91.00 to 95.00% and 2.43 to 2.76, respectively. At the end of the experiment, shell abnormality of B. areolata was found for all feeding trials.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Implication of global environmental changes on chemical toxicity-effect of water temperature, pH, and ultraviolet B irradiation on acute toxicity of several pharmaceuticals in Daphnia magna
AN  - 214697839; 19936919
AB  - Global environmental change poses emerging environmental health challenges throughout the world. One of such threats could be found in chemical safety in aquatic ecosystem. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of several environmental factors, such as water pH, temperature and ultraviolet light on the toxicity of pharmaceutical compounds in water, using freshwater invertebrate Daphnia magna. Seven pharmaceuticals including ibuprofen, acetaminophen, lincomycin, ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, chlortetracycline and sulfathiazole were chosen as test compounds based on their frequent detection in water. The experimental conditions of environmental parameters were selected within the ranges that could be encountered in temperate environment, i.e., water temperature (15, 21, and 25°C), pH (7.4, 8.3, and 9.2), and UV-B light intensity (continuous irradiation of 15.0 μW/cm^sup 2^). For acetaminophen, enrofloxacin and sulfathiazole, decrease in water pH generally led to increase of acute lethal toxicity, which could be explained by the unionized fraction of pharmaceuticals. Increase of water temperature enhanced the acute toxicity of the acetaminophen, enrofloxacin and chlortetracycline, potentially due to alteration in toxicokinetics of chemicals as well as impact on physiological mechanisms of the test organism. The presence of UV-B light significantly increased the toxicity of sulfathiazole, which could be explained by photo-modification of this chemical that lead to oxidative stress. Under the UV light, however, acute toxicity of enrofloxacin decreased, which might be due to photo-degradation. Since changing environmental conditions could affect exposure and concentration-response profile of environmental contaminants, such conditions should be identified and evaluated in order to better manage ecosystem health under changing global environment.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Effects of bisphenol A in the ring-legged earwig, Euborellia annulipes
AN  - 214683787; 19898982
AB  - Bisphenol A is a known endocrine disruptor in vertebrates that mimics the action of estrogens by interacting with hormone receptors. It also affects reproduction and development in many invertebrate animals, though mechanisms of action are unclear. Terrestrial insects, despite their abundance and profound ecological significance, have been largely overlooked as a group that might be affected by vertebrate endocrine disrupting chemicals. We evaluated potential effects of bisphenol A on the ring-legged earwig, Euborellia annulipes, as a model for terrestrial arthropods. Dosages of 0, 0.12, 1.2 and 12 μg bisphenol A were injected over a 6 day period into newly eclosed males and newly mated (7-day) females. The lowest dosage (0.12 μg) was most effective in eliciting significant effects including reducing weight gain while increasing testis size and seminal vesicle size; higher dosages were less effective or ineffective. In females, treatment with 0.12 μg bisphenol A enhanced clutch size but higher dosages were required to affect the duration of embryogenesis in offspring of treated mothers. Hatching success and the onset of the second reproductive cycle were not affected by treatments. No gross abnormalities were observed as a result of treatment in the reproductive structures of either males or females. Similarly, injection of varying concentrations of estradiol into males enhanced testis length, though it had no effect on seminal vesicle size. Lastly, we administered bisphenol A in drinking water for up to 2 weeks. Surprisingly, as little as 1 μg/L inhibited testis growth; 100 μg/L inhibited ovarian growth.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Impact of Marine Drugs on Cytoskeleton-Mediated Reproductive Events
AN  - 1536071274
AB  - Marine organisms represent an important source of novel bioactive compounds, often showing unique modes of action. Such drugs may be useful tools to study complex processes such as reproduction; which is characterized by many crucial steps that start at gamete maturation and activation and virtually end at the first developmental stages. During these processes cytoskeletal elements such as microfilaments and microtubules play a key-role. In this review we describe: (i) the involvement of such structures in both cellular and in vitro processes; (ii) the toxins that target the cytoskeletal elements and dynamics; (iii) the main steps of reproduction and the marine drugs that interfere with these cytoskeleton-mediated processes. We show that marine drugs, acting on microfilaments and microtubules, exert a wide range of impacts on reproductive events including sperm maturation and motility, oocyte maturation, fertilization, and early embryo development.

T1  - SOD and CAT cDNA cloning, and expression pattern of detoxification genes in the freshwater bivalve Unio tumidus transplanted into the Moselle river
AN  - 214683985; 19784772
AB  - The cDNA sequences encoding manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) and catalase (CAT) were isolated in the freshwater bivalve Unio tumidus by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using degenerate primers. Quantitative real-time PCR approach was used to evaluate the mRNA expression patterns of SOD, CAT, selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase (Se-GPx), pi class glutathione S-transferase (pi-GST) and metallothionein (MT), in the digestive gland of Unio tumidus transplanted from a control site to four stations in the Moselle River (M1-M4), for periods of 8 and 21 days. These sites were chosen upstream and downstream of populated areas. Chemical analysis performed on sediments from the Moselle river sites did not show high levels of pollutants. Decrease of SOD, CAT, Se-GPx and MT mRNA levels were observed at M3 site after a 21-day exposure compared to control site. These results suggest inefficiency of antioxidant systems affected by cytotoxic mechanisms and confirm an environmental perturbation. Organisms transplanted at M4 site showed a strong increase of biomarkers transcription levels after 21 days of exposure. These inductions could correspond to an adaptive response to an altered environment. Our results showed that biological approaches using multibiomarkers appear as essential tools complementary to measurement of contaminants, to detect environmental degradations.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Contaminants in the Upper Mississippi River: historic trends, responses to regulatory controls, and emerging concerns
AN  - 195890400
AB  - Issue Title: Upper Mississippi River Research Synthesis:  Forty Years of Ecological Research / Guest Editors: S.P. Romano & B. Ickes

              
We synthesized information on selected contaminants in the Upper Mississippi River, summarized regulatory measures enacted to reduce pollution, and described biotic and ecosystem responses to regulatory actions. Contamination of the river with mercury and lead rapidly followed settlement of the basin by European immigrants in the mid-1800s. Metal contamination peaked in the 1960s and has since decreased substantially. DDT, its degradation product DDE, and PCBs biomagnified to concentrations that adversely affected wildlife in upper trophic levels. National (U.S.A.) environmental regulations enacted from 1972 to 1991 reduced discharges of wastes from point sources, improved wastewater treatment, and reduced or banned the production or usage of certain chemicals, such as DDT, PCBs, and lead. Responses to these regulatory measures include reductions in ecosystem contamination, reductions in biotic exposure, and recovery of affected wildlife populations. Recovery from pollution has been slow, however, and we conclude that proactive approaches focusing on prevention are highly preferable to reactive approaches in management of toxic substances. Past successes in reducing point-source pollution, which is greatest near urban areas, do not extend to nonpoint-source pollution, given that the existing regulatory framework does not adequately address nonpoint sources. The river continues to receive hundreds of recently synthesized chemicals, and the behavior and effects of most of these compounds in aquatic ecosystems are largely unknown. Emerging contaminants and recently discovered mechanisms of adverse biological effects, such as endocrine disruption, pose continuing challenges to scientists and environmental managers concerned with the ecological health of this riverine ecosystem.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Similarities in zooplankton community between River Drawa and its two tributaries (Polish part of River Odra)
AN  - 288347156
AB  - Zooplankton communities were studied in a river and its tributaries with different hydrological, biological and physico-chemical conditions. Small similarities were noted in the zooplankton community (mostly Rotifera) between a tributary characterised by a regular bed and the river. No influence of a tributary with an irregular bed and variable water flow was noted on the zooplankton of the river it joined. It was concluded that the tributaries had very little influence on the zooplankton community in the river which they joined. The most probable reasons for this were the predatory behaviour of fry, escape of zooplankton into the river vegetation and therefore not carried down by the river current, and reproduction of zooplankton in slack waters, small floodplains and densely vegetated riparian zones of the main river.

T1  - Sublethal toxicant effects with dynamic energy budget theory: model formulation
AN  - 214696075; 19633955
AB  - We develop and test a general modeling framework to describe the sublethal effects of pollutants by adding toxicity modules to an established dynamic energy budget (DEB) model. The DEB model describes the rates of energy acquisition and expenditure by individual organisms; the toxicity modules describe how toxicants affect these rates by changing the value of one or more DEB parameters, notably the parameters quantifying the rates of feeding and maintenance. We investigate four toxicity modules that assume: (1) effects on feeding only; (2) effects on maintenance only; (3) effects on feeding and maintenance with similar values for the toxicity parameters; and (4) effects on feeding and maintenance with different values for the toxicity parameters. We test the toxicity modules by fitting each to published data on feeding, respiration, growth and reproduction. Among the pollutants tested are metals (mercury and copper) and various organic compounds (chlorophenols, toluene, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, tetradifon and pyridine); organisms include mussels, oysters, earthworms, water fleas and zebrafish. In most cases, the data sets could be adequately described with any of the toxicity modules, and no single module gave superior fits to all data sets. We therefore propose that for many applications, it is reasonable to use the most general and parameter sparse module, i.e. module 3 that assumes similar effects on feeding and maintenance, as a default. For one example (water fleas), we use parameter estimates to calculate the impact of food availability and toxicant levels on the long term population growth rate.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Genotoxicity monitoring of freshwater environments using caged carp (Cyprinus carpio)
AN  - 214669164; 19626438
AB  - The present study deals with genotoxicity assessment of freshwaters using caged carp (Cyprinus carpio). Carps were transplanted from a fish-farm to three differently polluted sites in eastern Croatia. Two polluted sites were situated in the river Drava, downstream from the cities of Belisce and Osijek, while the reference site was in the Nature Park Kopacki rit, a preserved wetland area with limited anthropogenic influence. Exposure lasted for 3 weeks and was repeated for 3 years (2002-2004). DNA damage was assessed in erythrocytes of the exposed animals by the Comet assay and micronucleus test (MNT). In order to evaluate possible differences in stress responses to polluted water in situ and in aquaria a laboratory exposure was performed with water from the studied location in the second year of the study. Carp from the sites with high anthropogenic influence (Belisce and Osijek) had higher average DNA damage as expressed in both the MNT and Comet assay. Of the two, the Comet assay appeared to be more sensitive following both caging and aquaria exposures. The results from this study suggest that 3 weeks caging exposure of C. carpio may be a useful strategy to monitor for genotoxic agents in freshwater ecosystems.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Variations in retention efficiency of bivalves to different concentrations and organic content of suspended particles
AN  - 204989941
AB  - Retention efficiencies (RE) of scallop (Chlamys farreri), oyster (Crassostrea gigas) and mussel (Mytilus edulis) in a flow-through system were measured to understand the short-term response to various particle and organic matter concentrations. By comparing the RE of C. farreri with that of C. gigas and M. edulis, we gained further knowledge on the feeding physiological characteristics of C. farreri and ascertained the possible cause of high summer mortalities of this species. The experimental feeding conditions included natural differences in the abundance and composition of suspended seston, as well as conditions in which seston abundance and composition were manipulated by adding natural silt or cultured microalgae. The results show that in natural sea water, the minimum particle size for maximal retention in M. edulis, C. gigas and C. farreri was approximately 4, 6, and 8 μm, respectively; the RE of 2-μm (equivalent spherical diameter) particles was 17%, 19%, and 8%, respectively; and the relative standardized RE was 58%, 49%, and 18%, respectively. In C. gigas and M. edulis, the minimal particle size for maximal retention did not change with food quality (organic content). C. farreri was more sensitive to fluctuations in particle concentration and organic content. With particle concentration increase, the minimal particle size for maximal retention in scallop shifted to large particles and the RE for 2-μm particle decreased from 8% in natural seawater to 1.6%-6% in silt-enriched groups. With organic content increase, the minimal particle size for maximal retention shifted from 8 to 5 μm in natural seawater.Variation in RE of C. farreri with food conditions and the relationship between lower RE and smaller particle size may hamper C. farreri from food taking due to the decrease in the size distribution of phytoplankton in Sungo Bay.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

Yet, they are rarely used as such in the construction of topological (predator-prey) food webs. We constructed food webs of vertebrate trophic interactions using observed diet alone, trophically transmitted parasites alone, and the combination of the two based on data from 31 species of fish from the Bothnian Bay, Finland. The fish food web contained 530 links derived from observed diet, 724 links inferred from parasitism, and 1,058 links calculated from a combination of both stomach contents and parasites. This sub-web constructed from stomach contents had a mean of 17.1 links per fish species, while that using parasites had 23.4 links per fish. Combining the two diet indicators yielded 34.1 links per fish species, illustrating the complementarity of the two methods. Mean number of prey species per fish species was 12.5 using observed diet items, 15.8 using parasites, and 24.5 using both measures together. Mean number of predators per fish species was 7.4 using observed diet, 11.7 using parasites and 15.0 using both. A positive correlation was found between the mean number of parasites and the number of prey taxa in the diet among the fishes. Omnivorous fish had the highest diversity of both parasite species and prey items, while benthophagous fish had among the lowest. Mean total abundance and mean total prevalence of parasites correlated positively with fish size, with piscivores being the largest with the highest abundance and prevalence, while planktivores and benthivores had the lowest. Trophically transmitted parasites may be used to help construct vertebrate sub-webs and derive information about food web processes. Parasites alone provided equivalent if not more information than observed diet. However, resolution is improved by using parasites and observed diet together.

T1  - Comparative study of the fate and mobility of metals discharged in mining and urban effluents using sequential extractions on suspended solids
AN  - 196387704; 19016333
AB  - The fate, bioavailability and environmental impacts of metals discharged in municipal and mining wastewater discharge will depend to a large extent on chemical speciation and distribution. Previous studies on metal bioaccumulation have shown that total metal concentrations are not a good predictor of bioavailability in the dispersion plumes of municipal effluents. The objective of this study was to determine the solid phase speciation of metals in surface waters receiving urban and mining effluents in order to assess their fate and relative mobility in the receiving environment. Suspended particulate matter was sampled using sediment traps at several sites downstream of effluent outfall plumes as well as at reference upstream sites. Particulate metal in operationally defined fractions--exchangeable/carbonates, reducible, oxidisable and residual--were determined in suspended particulate matter with a series of selective chemical extractions. Metal enrichment in suspended particles was generally observed in both mining and urban effluent discharges. When compared to its receiving environment, the mining effluent appeared to release more particulate metals (Cu, Fe, Zn) in the most reactive fractions (i.e. exchangeable/carbonates + reducible forms, 23-43%), while other released metals, such as Cd and Mn, were predominantly in the least reactive forms (i.e., oxidisable + residual, 73-97%). In contrast, the reactivity of all particulate metals, with the exception of Mn,  from the urban effluent was much higher, with up to 65, 42, 30 and 43% for Cd, Cu, Fe and Zn, respectively, in the two most reactive fractions. As expected in effluent dispersion plumes, parameters such as the organic carbon, Fe oxide and carbonate contents have specific effects on the partitioning of several trace metals, particularly Cd, Cu and Zn. Our results indicated that the relative distributions of metals among geochemical fractions varied in the effluent receiving waters where organic carbon and Fe oxides appeared as the most important parameters. This could therefore decrease the exposure for aquatic organisms that are exposed to those contaminated sediments as well as the risk to human health. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Differential expression of heat shock protein 70 in relation to stress type in the flatworm Schmidtea polychroa
AN  - 195904276
AB  - Most heat shock proteins help to cope with stress in organisms ranging from bacteria to vertebrates. Many stress types acting on the intensity of intracellular protein can induce expression of heat shock proteins. Here, we studied changes in expression level of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), one of the best investigated stress proteins, in response to five potential stress factors in the planarian flatworm Schmidtea polychroa: (1) homogenized planarian tissue, which releases an alarm substance that signals predation injury, (2) physical damage by puncturing, (3) a simulation of ecological competition by adding a mixture of naturally co-occurring species: one Dendrocoelum and two Polycelis flatworms, one Asellus water louse and one leech, and (4) magnesium chloride, which inhibits regeneration ability. We found that alarm substance (1), physical harm (2), and magnesium chloride (4) led to increased expression of Hsp70, while interspecific competition (3) did not result in elevated Hsp70 expression. There was no difference between the experimental negative control and two temporal controls immediately after collection and just before the experiment. Results show that Schmidtea polychroa is not sensitive to sampling and lab maintenance. However, planarian homogenate, magnesium chloride and physical harm all caused Hsp70-inducing stress. We conclude that Hsp70 quantification is appropriate to study the current stress level in planaria in response to specific conditions. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Standardizing acute toxicity data for use in ecotoxicology models: influence of test type, life stage, and concentration reporting
AN  - 214680703; 19533342
AB  - Ecotoxicological models generally have large data requirements and are frequently based on existing information from diverse sources. Standardizing data for toxicological models may be necessary to reduce extraneous variation and to ensure models reflect intrinsic relationships. However, the extent to which data standardization is necessary remains unclear, particularly when data transformations are used in model development. An extensive acute toxicity database was compiled for aquatic species to comprehensively assess the variation associated with acute toxicity test type (e.g., flow-through, static), reporting concentrations as nominal or measured, and organism life stage. Three approaches were used to assess the influence of these factors on log-transformed acute toxicity: toxicity ratios, log-linear models of factor groups, and comparison of interspecies correlation estimation (ICE) models developed using either standardized test types or reported concentration type. In general, median ratios were generally less than 2.0, the slopes of log-linear models were approximately one for well-represented comparisons, and ICE models developed using data from standardized test types or reported concentrations did not differ substantially. These results indicate that standardizing test data by acute test type, reported concentration type, or life stage may not be critical for developing ecotoxicological models using large datasets of log-transformed values.

T1  - Acute and chronic toxicity of atrazine and its metabolites deethylatrazine and deisopropylatrazine on aquatic organisms
AN  - 214679626; 19533344
AB  - Little is known about the toxicity of the atrazine (ATRZ) metabolites desethylatrazine (DEA) and deisopropylatrazine (DIA). We evaluated the acute and chronic toxicity of ATRZ, DEA, and DIA on the amphipods Hyalella azteca and Diporeia spp., and the unicellular algae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata. In general, acute and chronic toxicity was ranked ATRZ > DEA > DIA. All 96-h median inhibition concentrations (IC50) were above concentrations found in the environment (>1,500 μg/L), and sensitivity was highest for the algae. When amphipods were exposed chronically (21 days), Diporeia was several orders of magnitude more sensitive compared to H. azteca. Neither ATRZ nor DEA altered H. azteca sex ratios. In conclusion, our results suggest that short-term exposures of these chemicals to algae and amphipods to concentrations routinely detected in surface waters are unlikely to be a cause of concern. However, the unexpected high sensitivity of Diporeia spp. to these herbicides deserves further attention considering the declining status of this amphipod in the Great Lakes basin.

T1  - Use of Measurement Data in Evaluating Exposure of Humans and Wildlife to POPs/PBTs
AN  - 210696667
AB  - The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) recognized that POPs resist degradation, undergo long-range transport, and accumulate in remote ecosystems. The Stockholm Convention also acknowledged that indigenous communities, particularly in the Arctic, were at risk because of the biomagnification of POPs and contamination of their traditional foods. This recognition was largely based on environmental monitoring data and demonstrates the need to have adequate guidance on data collection and use. Although long-range transport, persistence, and bioaccumulation models are important for screening potential POPs and for assessing human exposure, environmental measurement data are needed to confirm predictions, indeed the Stockholm Convention (Annex E) requires monitoring data for assessing "exposure in local areas and, in particular, as a result of long-range environmental transport." However, there is relatively little guidance available on the most appropriate environmental measurement approaches, particularly for new candidate POPs, and on how to create a weight of evidence based on such data. We provide guidance on how to assess existing data that have been generated by monitoring programs and individual studies on the exposure of top predators and humans to candidate or potential POPs, as well as considerations for collecting new additional data. Our overall recommendation for assessing exposure in humans and top predators is to use or obtain direct measurements of the compound of concern from a significantly and uniquely exposed population (indigenous populations, remote populations), as well as data demonstrating biomagnification within food webs and time trends if possible. These data must be from the appropriate sample matrix type, collected and analyzed using accepted methodologies, reviewed for quality assurance, and interpreted correctly in order to be used to assess exposure.

AB  - Fate and exposure modeling has not, thus far, been explicitly used in the risk profile documents prepared for evaluating the significant adverse effect of candidate chemicals for either the Stockholm Convention or the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution. However, we believe models have considerable potential to improve the risk profiles. Fate and exposure models are already used routinely in other similar regulatory applications to inform decisions, and they have been instrumental in building our current understanding of the fate of persistent organic pollutants (POP) and persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic (PBT) chemicals in the environment. The goal of this publication is to motivate the use of fate and exposure models in preparing risk profiles in the POP assessment procedure by providing strategies for incorporating and using models. The ways that fate and exposure models can be used to improve and inform the development of risk profiles include 1) benchmarking the ratio of exposure and emissions of candidate chemicals to the same ratio for known POPs, thereby opening the possibility of combining this ratio with the relative emissions and relative toxicity to arrive at a measure of relative risk; 2) directly estimating the exposure of the environment, biota, and humans to provide information to complement measurements or where measurements are not available or are limited; 3) to identify the key processes and chemical or environmental parameters that determine the exposure, thereby allowing the effective prioritization of research or measurements to improve the risk profile; and 4) forecasting future time trends, including how quickly exposure levels in remote areas would respond to reductions in emissions. Currently there is no standardized consensus model for use in the risk profile context. Therefore, to choose the appropriate model the risk profile developer must evaluate how appropriate an existing model is for a specific setting and whether the assumptions and input data are relevant in the context of the application. It is possible to have confidence in the predictions of many of the existing models because of their fundamental physical and chemical, mechanistic underpinnings and the extensive work already done to compare model predictions and empirical observations. The working group recommends that modeling tools be applied for benchmarking PBT and POPs according to exposure-emissions relationships and that modeling tools be used to interpret emissions and monitoring data. The further development of models that combine fate, long-range transport, and bioaccumulation should be fostered, especially models that will allow time trends to be scientifically addressed in the risk profile.

T1  - Nitrogen dynamics at the sediment-water interface in shallow, sub-tropical Florida Bay: why denitrification efficiency may decrease with increased eutrophication
AN  - 223074545
AB  - Nitrogen (N) dynamics at the sediment-water interface were examined in four regions of Florida Bay to provide mechanistic information on the fate and effects of increased N inputs to shallow, subtropical, coastal environments. Dissimilatory nitrate (NO3-) reduction to ammonium (DNRA) was hypothesized to be a significant mechanism retaining bioreactive N in this warm, saline coastal ecosystem. Nitrogen dynamics, phosphorus (P) fluxes, and sediment oxygen demand (SOD) were measured in north-central (Rankin Key; eutrophic), north-eastern (Duck Key; high N to P seston ratios), north-western (Murray Key; low N to P ratios), and central (Rabbit Key; typical central site) Florida Bay in August 2004, January 2005, and November 2006. Site water was passed over intact sediment cores, and changes in oxygen (O2), phosphate (o-PO43-), ammonium (NH4+), NO3-, nitrite (NO2-), and N2 concentrations were measured, without and with addition of excess 15NO3 - or 15NH4+ to inflow water. These incubations provided estimates of SOD, nutrient fluxes, N2 production, and potential DNRA rates. Denitrification rates were lowest in summer, when SOD was highest. DNRA rates and NH4+ fluxes were high in summer at the eutrophic Rankin site, when denitrification rates were low and almost no N2 came from added 15NO3 -. Highest 15NH4+ accumulation, resulting from DNRA, occurred at Rabbit Key during a picocyanobacteria bloom in November. 15NH4+ accumulation rates among the stations correlated with SOD in August and January, but not in November during the algal bloom. These mechanistic results help explain why bioreactive N supply rates are sometimes high in Florida Bay and why denitrification efficiency may decrease with increased NO3                         - inputs in sub-tropical coastal environments.

T1  - cDNA cloning and expression of a collectin from red-spotted grouper (Epinephelus akaara)
AN  - 205044856
AB  - Lectins play a crucial role in the innate immunity of invertebrates and vertebrates by recognizing and disposing of pathogens. We obtained the complete cDNA of a C-type lectin (EALec1) from Epinephelus akaara using RACE. The complete EALec1 cDNA sequence was 827 bp. The 5-UTR and 3-UTR were 28 bp and 151 bp, respectively, in length. The sequence also contained a polyadenylation signal AATAAA and a poly(A) tail. The EALec1 cDNA encodes polypeptides with 215 amino acids, including a signal peptide of 31 amino acids. The protein has a cysteine-rich region at the N terminal, a collagenous region characterized by G-X-Y repeats, a neck region, and a typical carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD), indicating that EALec1 is a collectin. The key recognition positions of this CRD are EPD, isolated for the first time in fish. These are likely the interim types, between mannan-binding lectin and galactose-binding lectin. We evaluated the expression pattern of EALec1 in 12 different tissues using RT-PCR. EALec1 was expressed in all tissues, though at different levels. In addition, we inserted EALec1 into an expression vector (pET-28a) for transformation into the BL21 engineering bacteria. Based on enzyme digestion and sequencing of the positive clone, we successfully constructed the EALec1 recombinant expression vector.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Online detection of waterborne bioavailable copper by valve daily rhythms in freshwater clam Corbicula fluminea
AN  - 222019348; 18607762
AB  - Freshwater clam Corbicula fluminea, a surrogate species in metal toxicity testing, is a promising bioindicator of impairment in aquatic ecosystems. Little is known, however, about the relationship between clam valve daily rhythmic response and metal bioavailability related to a metal biological early warning system (BEWS) design. The purpose of this study was to link biotic ligand model (BLM)-based bioavailability and valve daily rhythm in C. fluminea to design a biomonitoring system for online in situ detection of waterborne copper (Cu). We integrated the Hill-based dose-time-response function and the fitted daily rhythm function of valve closure into a constructed programmatic mechanism. The functional presentation of the present dynamic system was completely demonstrated by employing a LabVIEW graphic control program in a personal computer. We used site-specific effect concentration causing 10% of total valve closure response (EC10) as the detection threshold to implement the proposed C. fluminea-based Cu BEWS. Here our results show that the proposed C. fluminea-based BEWS could be deliberately synthesized to online in situ transmit rapidly the information on waterborne bioavailable Cu levels under various aquatic environmental conditions through monitoring the valve daily rhythmic changes. We suggested that the developed C. fluminea-based dynamic biomonitoring system could assist in developing technically defensible site-specific water quality criteria to promote more efficient uses in water resources for protection of species health in aquatic environments.

T1  - Effects of norfloxacin and butylated hydroxyanisole on the freshwater microalga Scenedesmus obliquus
AN  - 214672306; 19495962
AB  - Issue Title: Special issue on Source Water Risk Control. Guest Editors: Tim Ford and Shupei Cheng

              
The toxic effects of norfloxacin (NOR) and butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) on the microalga Scenedesmus obliquus were assessed in terms of growth rate, concentration of chlorophyll a, activities of 7-ethoxyresorufin-o-dealkylases (EROD), glutathione s-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT) and total malondialdehyde content (MDA). The 96 h EC50 was 38.49 and 11.12 mg/l for NOR and BHA, respectively. Growth of S. obliquus was affected slightly under low concentrations of BHA (<4 mg/l) and NOR (<15 mg/l) over the 96 h exposure period. With the increasing concentrations of these two compounds, growth of S. oblique decreased significantly. Growth inhibition was 82.4% at 60.0 mg/l for NOR and 60.6% at 16.0 mg/l for BHA after 96 h. A similar trend was also observed for chlorophyll a. NOR and BHA affected Phase I and Phase II enzyme activities differently. Upon exposure to NOR, EROD was induced at concentration <15.0 mg/l and depressed at concentrations >30 mg/l significantly. CAT and GST exhibited similar trends during the exposure period. Compared to controls, MDA content only showed high induction at high concentrations of NOR (>30 mg/l). However, EROD activity did not display any change compared to control responses during BHA exposure, whereas GST showed significant induction for all concentrations over the exposure period. CAT activity showed induction at low concentration and depression at high concentration. MDA content increased with the rise of BHA during the exposure period. These types of assays, revealing toxic effects of NOR and BHA to phototrophs, could be employed to assess the potential risks of these xenobiotics to aquatic ecological systems.

T1  - Model of palaeoenvironmental evolution of the Black Sea region during the last glacial maximum--Holocene
AN  - 205295405
AB  - A model for the palaeoenvironmental evolution of the Black Sea and its adjacent basins during the past 20.000 years, in which variations in sedimentation, erosion, and hydrologic processes as a result of climatic change are taken into consideration, is developed. The data used include those from five cruises in the Black Sea with the participation of the author, seismo-acoustic data in the possession of the Institute of Oceanology in Varna, and data from the published literature. The most important result is that the water level of the Black Sea is controlled largely by that of the Marmara Sea via the Bosporus sill. The water circulation in the south part of the Bosporus channel as natural regulative mechanism of the Black Sea level during 11800-9000 yr C14 BP is produced. A succession of climatic and water conditions for the Black Sea by pollen analysis is presented. The linear ridges on the Black Sea shelf as result of the lower Holocene regression are proved by means of a stratigraphic interpretation of the seismo-acoustic profiles. The levels of the Black Sea, Marmara Sea, and Mediterranean at regarded intervals of time are presented. An attempt at explanation of maximum number of facts from the study region with this model is made. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Nitrogen loading from anthropogenic sources, including fertilizer, manure, and sewage effluents, has been linked with declining water quality in coastal lagoons worldwide. Freshwater inputs to mid-Atlantic coastal lagoons of the USA are from terrestrially influenced sources: groundwater and overland flow via streams and agricultural ditches, with occasional precipitation events. Stable nitrogen isotopes ratios (δ15N) in bioindicator species combined with conventional water quality monitoring were used to assess nitrogen sources and provide insights into their origins. Water quality data revealed that nutrients derived from terrestrial sources increased after precipitation events. Tissues from two bioindicator species, a macroalgae (Gracilaria sp.) and the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) were analyzed for δ15N to determine spatial and temporal patterns of nitrogen sources. A broad-scale survey assessment of deployed macroalgae (June 2004) detected regions of elevated δ15N. Macroalgal δ15N (7.33±1.15[per thousand] in May 2006 and 6.76±1.15[per thousand] in July 2006) responded quickly to sustained June 2006 nutrient pulse, but did not detect spatial patterns at the fine scale. Oyster δ15N (8.51±0.89[per thousand]) responded slowly over longer time periods and exhibited a slight gradient at the finer spatial scale. Overall, elevated δ15N values in macroalgae and oysters were used to infer that human and animal wastes were important nitrogen sources in some areas of Maryland's coastal bays. Different nitrogen integration periods across multiple organisms may be used to indicate nitrogen sources at various spatial and temporal scales, which will help focus nutrient management.

T1  - Modelo preditivo de sobrevivencia do Mexilhao Dourado (Limnoperna fortunei) em relacao a variacoes de salinidade na Laguna dos Patos, RS, Brasil
AN  - 215434589
AB  - Limnoperna fortunei (golden mussel), a freshwater bivalve native to Southeast Asia, invaded southern South America around 1991. Using species' occurrence records and salinity in different seasons in Laguna dos Patos, RS, Brazil, we predict survival probabilities in different regions of the lagoon during the different seasons of the year. We fitted the data to a logistic regression model. A total of 26 presence records (live, dead) of L. fortunei and salinity at those locations were obtained from the literature for the Laguna dos Patos in the period 2001-2004. Additional data on salinity were used to interpolate salinity values to all regions of the lagoon. The logistic regression model shows that survival decreases as salinity increases. The model predicted high survival probability of the species during periods of low salinity (austral winter) in the limnic, pre-limnic and estuarine regions of the lagoon. During the high salinity period (summer), the species is able to survive only in the limnic and pre-limnic region of the lagoon. These data suggest that control measures should be carried out most effectively during the summer. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Valve movement response of the freshwater clam Corbicula fluminea following exposure to waterborne arsenic
AN  - 214673942; 19396543
AB  - We developed an inductance-based valvometry technique as a detection system to measure the valve daily activity in freshwater clam Corbicula fluminea in response to waterborne arsenic. Our findings reveal that C. fluminea experiences a valve opening in the absence of arsenic predominantly in the morning hours (03:00-08:00) with a mean daily opening/closing period of 21.32 (95% CI: 20.58-22.05) h. Amplification of daily activity occurred in the presence of arsenic. Behavioral toxicity assays revealed arsenic detection thresholds of 0.60 (95% CI: 0.53-0.66) mg l-1 and 0.35 (95% CI: 0.30-0.40) mg l-1 for response times of 60 and 300 min, respectively. The proposed valve daily activity model was linked with response time-specific Hill dose-response functions to predict valve opening/closing behavior in response to arsenic. The predictive capabilities were verified satisfactory with the measurements. Our results implicate a biomonitoring system by valve daily activity in C. fluminea to identify safe water uses in areas with elevated arsenic.

T1  - Polychlorinated Biphenyls and Hudson River White Perch: Implications for Population-Level Ecological Risk Assessment and Risk Management
AN  - 210695921
AB  - Risk assessments and risk management decisions concerning risks to wild fish populations resulting from exposures to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and related chemicals have been based primarily on observations of effects of chemicals on individual organisms. Although the development and application of population-level ecological risk-assessment methods is proceeding at a rapid pace, the organism-level approach is still being justified by arguments that population-level ecological risk assessment is in an early stage of development and has not been shown to be reliable. This article highlights the importance of including population-level effects in risk-management decision-making, by examining the effects of exposures to PCBs on fish populations inhabiting the Hudson River, New York, USA, a system in which data have been collected for approximately 30 y concerning both concentrations of PCBs in sediment and fish tissue and the abundance and reproduction of exposed fish populations. We previously tested hypotheses concerning the effects of PCBs on the striped bass population of the Hudson River, and found that the available data conflicted with all of these hypotheses. Here, we report results of similar analyses of effects of historic PCB exposures on the Hudson River white perch population, using an extended data set that recently became available. As with striped bass, we found no correlation between maternal PCB tissue concentrations and any measure of reproductive success in Hudson River white perch during the 30-y period covered by the data set. Together with results of studies performed on fish populations exposed to PCBs at other sites, our results clearly demonstrate that physiological and genetic adaptation, biological compensation, and other ecological processes influence responses of fish populations to PCB exposures and should be considered in risk management decision-making.

T1  - Genetic evidence for the existence of cryptic species in an endangered clam Coelomactra antiquata
AN  - 208058965
AB  - Coelomactra antiquata is a commercially important bivalve species, but has been suffering from severe population decline due to over-exploitation and the deterioration of environmental conditions. Previous genetic survey of C. antiquata conducted with allozymes combined with morphology revealed high levels of genetic differentiation between northern and southern populations which suggests a cryptic species might exist in C. antiquata. To test this hypothesis, amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) and 16S rRNA gene sequence were used to re-evaluate the spatial genetic structure of six populations of C. antiquata along the coast of China. Both genetic markers display a sharp genetic break between the four northern populations (northern lineage) and two southern population (southern lineage). Large numbers of private alleles (AFLP) were found within the northern or southern populations and a deep divergence of about 6.5% in 16S rRNA gene sequence between the northern and southern lineages suggests the occurrence of potential cryptic or sibling species of C. antiquata. Applying previously published rates of mutation, divergence between the two lineages is estimated to have occurred approximately 3 million years ago and may be due to allopatric isolation during the middle Pliocene times. While no genetic differentiation was found within the northern or southern populations in both AFLP and 16S mtDNA markers, the results indicate that the northern and southern lineage should be managed separately and any translocation between the two areas should be avoided.

T1  - Natural impacted freshwaters: in situ use of alginate immobilized algae to the assessment of algal response
AN  - 214680077; 19247831
AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the feasibility of an in situ phytotoxicity test using alginate-immobilized algae for 60 days, in the assessment of water quality in an impacted small peri-urban stream. After laboratory optimization of algae immobilization/de-immobilization processes, the performance of immobilized/de-immobilized algae was compared to the performance of free algae in terms of specific algal growth and sensitivity. This was done by comparing 72 h EC50 values obtained with zinc and the pesticides clomazone and carbofuran. The results showed a similar performance, which allow us to conclude that immobilization for 60 days do not cause any significant alteration in algae physiology. In the field, immobilized algae were exposed at different times (2, 4 and 7 days) to water samples in both disturbed and undisturbed sites. Both laboratory and field experiments indicated that alginate-immobilized algae for 60 days were sufficiently sensitive for use in the in situ assessment of water quality.

T1  - Contamination of bivalve haemolymph samples by adductor muscle components: implications for biomarker studies
AN  - 214674426; 19083092
AB  - Haemolymph samples and haemocytes collected via the adductor muscles of bivalve molluscs are extensively used in ecotoxicological studies. Withdrawal of haemolymph from mussels, Mytilus edulis, via the posterior adductor muscle, may lead to contamination with the intracellular contents of adductor myocytes. Lysopine dehydrogenase (LyDH) activity, an adductor myocyte marker, was used to investigate the impact of this potential contamination on levels of total glutathione, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) measured in cell-free haemolymph. The mean glutathione content of cell-free haemolymph from 28 mussels was 3.2 ± 1.8 μM (mean ± SD). There was a linear relationship (slope = 0.28 ± 0.03 min; mean ± SE; P < 0.0001, n = 28) with haemolymph LyDH levels suggesting that at least some of the glutathione measured in cell-free haemolymph had arisen from contamination. Haemolymph LyDH activity was significantly higher in samples extracted using larger diameter needles, and also in samples where there had been some difficulty in the extraction. Exposure of mussels to oxidative stress using 40 μg l-1 Cu for 5 days resulted in a 1.7 fold increase in glutathione (P = 0.033), but no increase (P = 0.810) in LyDH activity in adductor muscle. This was reflected in a similar increase in the slope of a plot of cell-free haemolymph glutathione versus LyDH activity (P = 0.011), consistent with both of these having originated from the adductor muscle. Cell-free haemolymph GPx and AChE activities also correlated with LyDH activity (Spearman rank correlation coefficients of 0.531 (P = 0.0068) and 0.537 (P = 0.0062), respectively, n = 27) suggesting that these also arise from contamination of the haemolymph. For GPx there was a significant linear relationship (P = 0.025) with haemolymph LyDH levels consistent with both enzymes originating from the myocytes. However, there was hyperbolic relationship (P = 0.0004) between haemolymph AChE and LyDH activities. It appears that this is because the AChE originates from a different compartment to the LyDH, i.e. cholinergic neuromuscular junctions in the adductor muscle. We conclude that it would be prudent, when considering the possibility of using a biomarker in cell-free haemolymph from bivalve molluscs, to check whether contamination could be an issue.

T1  - Depositional history of the Miocene Lake Sinj (Dinaride Lake System, Croatia): a long-lived hard-water lake in a pull-apart tectonic setting
AN  - 194160564
AB  - Early Miocene transpressional wrenching yielded a series of NW-SE-elongated pull-apart basins in the Dinarides of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. They accommodated a huge lake system that gave rise to spectacular endemic mollusk radiation. Lake Sinj, moderately sized at 342 km2, flooded the south-westernmost basin of this system. Due to the karstic environment, the hard-water, alkaline, long-lived lake developed a sediment infill with an average thickness of 370 m, dominated by authigenic limestone. The studied section represents the upper third of the basinal infill and provides detailed insights into the critical period of the lake and of the basinal evolution during the final stages of its filling. It comprises two large-scale, shallowing-upward cycles, both starting with fossil-poor limestones, gradually passing into coal-bearing carbonate rocks and coal seams. The fossil-poor intervals are interpreted as phases of repetitive acidification events due to changing lake level, which induced periodic drying and flooding of the uppermost littoral zone inhabited by starfruit (Damasonium) meadows. The flooding of the aerated, limy mud plain introduced H+ ions from organic-matter decay reactions into the shallow lake. This decreased its pH level, with catastrophic consequences for its biota. The ecosystem then stabilized during the orbitally-forced, dry climate phases. Based on the mollusk record, streams still influenced the marginal lake environment and rich organic-matter production created swamps and mires. The onset of mollusk radiation in the section correlates with stabilized lake alkalinity, as indicated by the disappearance of starfruits, ongoing authigenic carbonate production and by coal seams representing textbook examples for coal formation in alkaline environments. The inferred basinal setting fits well with the pull-apart basin model, pointing to the presence of an extended shallow ramp in front of a steep, fault-induced hillside of the hinterland.

T1  - Challenges to incorporating spatially and temporally explicit phenomena (hotspots and hot moments) in denitrification models
AN  - 223074826
AB  - Issue Title: New approaches to modeling denitrification

              
Denitrification, the anaerobic reduction of nitrogen oxides to nitrogenous gases, is an extremely challenging process to measure and model. Much of this challenge arises from the fact that small areas (hotspots) and brief periods (hot moments) frequently account for a high percentage of the denitrification activity that occurs in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. In this paper, we describe the prospects for incorporating hotspot and hot moment phenomena into denitrification models in terrestrial soils, the interface between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and in aquatic ecosystems. Our analysis suggests that while our data needs are strongest for hot moments, the greatest modeling challenges are for hotspots. Given the increasing availability of high temporal frequency climate data, models are promising tools for evaluating the importance of hot moments such as freeze-thaw cycles and drying/rewetting events. Spatial hotspots are less tractable due to our inability to get high resolution spatial approximations of denitrification drivers such as carbon substrate. Investigators need to consider the types of hotspots and hot moments that might be occurring at small, medium, and large spatial scales in the particular ecosystem type they are working in before starting a study or developing a new model. New experimental design and heterogeneity quantification tools can then be applied from the outset and will result in better quantification and more robust and widely applicable denitrification models.

T1  - Age-Dependent Bioaccumulation of Organochlorine Compounds in Fish and their Selective Biotransformation in Top Predators from Lake Maggiore (Italy)
AN  - 208170456
AB  - Fish and piscivorous bird eggs collected in 2003 from Lake Maggiore (Italy), were analysed for PCB and DDT contamination. Lake Maggiore has been severely polluted by DDT through production of the pesticide within its catchment. Although agricultural application of DDT was banned in Italy in the 1978, industrial production continued until 1996, with enough contamination of water and soil for serious bioaccumulation in the lake biota. PCB and DDT concentrations in a whitefish (Coregonus macrophthalmus Nusslin 1882) were seen to be dependent on season and fish age, but not on sex. The average increase of the lipid-normalised concentration of DDTs and PCBs was two-fold across season and also across age, resulting in an overall increase of four fold. The seasonal variation was related to the eco-physiological cycle of the fish and to the contamination dynamic of the lake, while the effect of the fish age was explained on the base of biomagnification-related mechanisms. A fugacity model was applied to predict the age-dependent bioaccumulation potential of PCBs, whose concentrations were rather stable in recent years in the lake. Predicted values for compounds with negligible biotransformation were in good agreement with experimental data (calculated vs. experimental mean difference of 14%), and a relationship between the increase of experimental age-dependent concentration and Kow was observed. The good correspondence between the predicted and the measured values for most PCB congeners confirmed the general inability of fishes to biotransform these compounds. On the contrary, the importance of biotransformation processes was recognised in birds; eggs of a fish eating bird (Podiceps cristatus) from the same area selectively bioaccumulated p,p'-DDE. For PCBs, congener 149 appears to be completely metabolized by the bird species, and congeners 95, 101, 132, 151 and 174 were reduced as well. The role of the meta-para free position on at least one phenyl ring of PCB congeners in biotransformation processes was confirmed.  [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - A Survey of Organotin Compounds in the Northern Adriatic Sea
AN  - 208176800
AB  - The extent of pollution with organotin compounds was investigated in water, sediment and bivalve mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) from the Northern Adriatic Sea. Butyl-, phenyl- and octyltin species were quantified after extraction and derivatisation by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in a total of 99 samples from the period from 2000 to 2006. The accuracies of the analytical procedures were checked by spiking of unpolluted water samples and by the analysis of standard reference materials (harbour sediment PACS-2 and mussel tissue ERM-CE 477). Among organotin species analysed in samples butyltins were the predominant. Tributyltin was found to be present in the highest concentrations, suggesting its recent input into the marine environment. Butyltins were detected at all sites surveyed (sum of butyltins was up to 718 ng Sn L-1, 3,552 ng Sn g-1 d.w. and 9,991 ng Sn g-1 d.w. in water, sediment and mussel samples, respectively), phenytins in much lower concentrations (up to 31 ng Sn L-1, 326 ng Sn g-1 d.w. and 442 ng Sn g-1 d.w. in water, sediment and mussel samples) and to a much smaller extent, while octyltins were not detected at any location. The spatial distribution of tributyltin was closely related to boating, with the highest concentrations found in marinas (up to 586 ng Sn L-1 for water samples, 1,995 ng Sn g-1 d.w. for sediment and 6,434 ng Sn g-1 d.w. for mussel samples). The temporal distribution clearly indicates a decrease of organotin pollution at all sites.   [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - A Preliminary Survey of the Nitrogen and Carbon Isotope Characteristics of Fish from the Lagoons of Egypt's Nile Delta
AN  - 230053595
AB  - The present study reports nitrogen and carbon stable isotope data (δ15N and δ13C) from four large (63-400 km2), shallow (1 m) coastal lagoons on Egypt's Nile Delta. While the lagoons all receive sewage and agricultural drainage, the magnitude of loading varies. In this preliminary survey, we document wide variability in the δ15N and δ13C isotope values of major fish groups among these lagoons. There were no consistent or significant differences among the major groups of fish, including carp, catfish, mullet, and tilapia. There was a strong positive correlation (R                         2=0.84) between the average δ15N values of fish muscle and estimated water residence time among the lagoons. This preliminary evidence suggests that nitrogen cycle transformations may be more important than primary N source differences in determining N isotopic ratios of organisms in the lagoons. The δ13C results point to the probable importance of autochthonous particulate organic matter rather than terrestrial detritus or marine plankton in the diets of resident fish populations in the lagoons.

T1  - Seston Removal by Natural and Constructed Intertidal Eastern Oyster (Crassostrea virginica) Reefs: A Comparison with Previous Laboratory Studies, and the Value of in situ Methods
AN  - 230002151
AB  - An important ecological role ascribed to oysters is the transfer of materials from the water column to the benthos as they feed on suspended particles (seston). This ecosystem service has been often touted as a major reason for many oyster restoration efforts, but empirical characterization and quantification of seston removal rates in the field have been lacking. Changes in chlorophyll a (chl a) concentrations in the water column were measured in May 2005 and June 2006 in South Carolina using in situ fluorometry and laboratory analysis of pumped water samples taken upstream and downstream as water flowed over natural and constructed intertidal oyster reefs. Both methods gave similar results overall, but with wide variability within individual reef datasets. In situ fluorometer data logged at 10 to 30-s intervals for up to 1.3 h over eight different reefs (three natural and five constructed) showed total removal (or uptake) expressed as % removal of chl a ranging from -9.8% to 27.9%, with a mean of 12.9%. Our data indicate that restored shellfish reefs should provide water-quality improvements soon after construction, and the overall impact is probably determined by the size and density of the resident filter feeder populations relative to water flow characteristics over the reef. The measured population-level chl a removal was converted to mean individual clearance rates to allow comparison with previous laboratory studies. Although direct comparisons could not be made due to the small size of oysters on the study reefs (mean shell height, 36.1 mm), our calculated rates (mean, 1.21 L h-1) were similar to published laboratory measured rates for oysters of this size. However, the wide variability in measured removal by the oyster reefs suggests that individual oyster feeding rates in nature may be much more variable than in the laboratory. The proliferation of ecosystem-level models that simulate the impacts of bivalves on water quality based only on laboratory-feeding measurements underscores the importance of further research aimed at determining ecologically realistic feeding rates for oysters in the field. Because in situ methods provide many replicate measurements quickly, they represent a potentially powerful tool for quantifying the effects of oyster reefs, including all suspension-feeding taxa present, on water quality.

T1  - Larval history influences post-metamorphic condition in a coral-reef fish
AN  - 199291704; 18836749
AB  - Upon settlement, many fishes undergo an energetically costly metamorphic period that requires substantial nutritional reserves. Larval growth and the accumulation of lipids prior to metamorphosis are likely to influence growth and survival following this critical period. On the Caribbean island of St. Croix, I investigated relationships between larval growth, early life-history characteristics, and post-metamorphic lipid content in the bluehead wrasse Thalassoma bifasciatum. Lipid reserves remaining after metamorphosis were positively related (r                         2 = 0.62) to the width of the metamorphic band; thus, this otolith-derived trait may be used to estimate the condition at emergence of survivors collected at some later time. In contrast, pelagic larval duration, average larval growth, and otolith size at settlement were negatively related to post-metamorphic lipid content. Interestingly, the trend for slower growth among fish in good condition was not consistent over the entire pelagic larval duration. Analyses of daily larval growth histories indicated that fish with high lipid reserves grew rapidly in the last week prior to settlement, but relatively slowly during the early phases of larval life; those emerging with low lipid concentrations, however, displayed strikingly opposite patterns. These contrasting patterns of growth and energy storage were consistent at two sites and over three recruitment events. Otolith chemistry data suggested that differences in growth histories and body condition were consistent with the hypothesis of larval development in distinct oceanic environments (characterized by Pb concentration); but, within a water mass, differences reflected life-history trade-offs between growth and energy storage. The results have implications for understanding the processes driving juvenile survival, which may be condition dependent.

T1  - Spatial and seasonal patterns in water quality in an embayment-mainstem reach of the tidal freshwater Potomac River, USA: a multiyear study
AN  - 193263534; 18214699
AB  - Spatial and temporal patterns in water quality were studied for seven years within an embayment-river mainstem area of the tidal freshwater Potomac River. The purpose of this paper is to determine the important components of spatial and temporal variation in water quality in this study area to facilitate an understanding of management impacts and allow the most effective use of future monitoring resources. The study area received treated sewage effluent and freshwater inflow from direct tributary inputs into the shallow embayment as well as upriver sources in the mainstem. Depth variations were determined to be detectable, but minimal due mainly to the influence of tidal mixing. Results of principal component analysis of two independent water quality datasets revealed clear spatial and seasonal patterns. Interannual variation was generally minimal despite substantial variations in tributary and mainstem discharge among years. Since both spatial and seasonal components were important, data were segmented by season to best determine the spatial pattern. A clear difference was found between a set of stations located within one embayment (Gunston Cove) and a second set in the nearby Potomac mainstem. Parameters most highly correlated with differences were those typically associated with higher densities of phytoplankton: chlorophyll a, photosynthetic rate, pH, dissolved oxygen, BOD, total phosphorus and Secchi depth. These differences and their consistency indicated two distinct water masses: one in the cove harboring higher algal density and activity and a second in the river with lower phytoplankton activity. A second embayment not receiving sewage effluent generally had an intermediate position. While this was the most consistent spatial pattern, there were two others of a secondary nature. Stations closer to the effluent inputs in the embayment sometimes grouped separately due to elevated ammonia and chloride. Stations closer to tributary inflows into the embayment sometimes grouped separately due to dilution with freshwater runoff. Segmenting the datasets by spatial region resulted in a clarification of seasonal patterns with similar factors relating to algal activity being the major correlates of the seasonal pattern. A basic seasonal pattern of lower scores in the spring increasing steadily to a peak in July and August followed by a steady decline through the fall was observed in the cove. In the river, the pattern of increases tended to be delayed slightly in the spring. Results indicate that the study area can be effectively monitored with fewer study sites provided that at least one is located in each of the spatial regions. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Carbon isotopes in mollusk shell carbonates
AN  - 220285178
AB  - Mollusk shells contain many isotopic clues about calcification physiology and environmental conditions at the time of shell formation. In this review, we use both published and unpublished data to discuss carbon isotopes in both bivalve and gastropod shell carbonates. Land snails construct their shells mainly from respired CO2, and shell [delta]13C reflects the local mix of C3 and C4 plants consumed. Shell [delta]13C is typically >10[per thousand] heavier than diet, probably because respiratory gas exchange discards CO2, and retains the isotopically heavier HCO3-. Respired CO2 contributes less to the shells of aquatic mollusks, because CO2/O2 ratios are usually higher in water than in air, leading to more replacement of respired CO2 by environmental CO2. Fluid exchange with the environment also brings additional dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) into the calcification site. Shell [delta]13C is typically a few [per thousand] lower than ambient DIC, and often decreases with age. Shell [delta]13C retains clues about processes such as ecosystem metabolism and estuarine mixing. Ca2+ ATPase-based models of calcification physiology developed for corals and algae likely apply to mollusks, too, but lower pH and carbonic anhydrase at the calcification site probably suppress kinetic isotope effects. Carbon isotopes in biogenic carbonates are clearly complex, but cautious interpretation can provide a wealth of information, especially after vital effects are better understood.

T1  - The Lake Michigan Eutrophication Model, LM3-Eutro: Model Development and Calibration
AN  - 216070475; 18939608
AB  - A eutrophication model developed to generate primary-production estimates in Lake Michigan can simulate 17 state variables, including three plankton classes and several nutrients. The model, known as the Lake Michigan Eutrophication model (LM3-Eutro), has a high-resolution computational grid that enables good spatial description of spring temperature and phytoplankton concentrations, which have significant gradients in the lakes. The grid also allows the model to predict concentrations in nearshore areas and other regions of interest. The model provided more accurate estimates of algal light limitation based on three-hour intervals compared to daily averages that are used in most eutrophication models, especially during sunny summer days when algal photo-inhibition often occurs. Model output was compared to field data using statistical parameters such as squares of the correlation coefficients to determine the best model fit. The calibrated model output fit the field data reasonably well for nutrients and phytoplankton, which provided confidence in the framework, governing equations, and coefficients used.

T1  - Secretion of byssal threads and attachment strength of Mytilus galloprovincialis: the influence of size and food availability
AN  - 224143666
AB  - Byssogenesis rate and attachment strength of the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis were investigated in the laboratory considering different body sizes and feeding conditions. Byssal thread secretion was significantly higher in juveniles as compared to larger mussels of approximately 87 mm shell length. Asymptotic number of threads attached was obtained from approximately 72 hours onwards within a range of 42-46 and 27-31 for juveniles and larger experimental mussels, respectively (P < 0.05 ANOVA). Absorption efficiency values of control fed individuals dropped significantly from 0.78 in juveniles to 0.70 in larger mussels (P < 0.001 ANOVA) which pointed out energetic constraints of mussels with regard to their size and its probable effect on byssus secretion rates. Attachment force was 2.8 times higher in larger mussels than in juveniles (2.21 versus 0.78 N for both sizes, respectively; P < 0.001 ANOVA) which in turn followed the same order of magnitude than differences in the thread's thickness values of both experimental mussel sizes. Tenacity followed a reverse pattern with juveniles presenting two-fold higher values than larger mussels (P < 0.001 ANOVA) based on a lower increment of attachment force (x2.8) as compared to shell area (x6) for the comparison larger versus juvenile mussel size, which in turn might suggest that larger specimens secreted weaker threads. When animals were maintained unfed for a week, a significant drop in both byssus secretion and attachment force were observed in juveniles but was not the case for larger mussels most likely as a consequence of a relatively short period of maintenance under food availability stress for the latter individuals that showed significantly higher initial condition and/or energetic store values. Accordingly, the use of energetic reserves in juveniles kept unfed for a week together with a significant drop in byssus secretion and attachment force might suggest a link, i.e. transfer of energy between soft tissues and byssus under stress. Quantitative values of byssal threads, based on the significance of the byssus versus attachment force relationship, together with its morphometric value, i.e. thread's thickness, represented a primary mechanism to explain variability in attachment strength of M. galloprovincialis of the different body sizes studied here.

T1  - Aerobic and anaerobic enzymatic activities of Calyptogena gallardoi (Vesicomyidae): a clam associated with methane cold seeps off Chile
AN  - 224135394
AB  - Calyptogena gallardoi is a recently described species of vesicomyid clam associated to the extensive gas-hydrate field reported for the Chilean margin along 35°S to 45°S. Enzymatic analysis in foot, gill and abductor muscle tissues of C. gallardoi collected in central-south Chile (~36°21[variant prime]S 73°44[variant prime]W), show high activities for malate dehydrogenase (MDH), strombine dehydrogenase (STRDH) and alanopine dehydrogenase (ALPDH) and a low activity of citrate synthase (CS) and ETS (electron transport system). Positive significant correlations (log-log scale) were found between enzymatic activities involved in anaerobic metabolism (MDH versus LDH and ALPDH versus STRDH), as well as between CS and opines dehydrogenases. The ratio MDH/LDH or any other opine dehydrogenase assayed was >> 1 in all tissues analysed. These results indicate that C. gallardoi is highly adapted to the harsh anaerobic conditions of marine chemosynthesis-based communities inhabiting a reduced environment. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Biogeochemical response of organic-rich freshwater marshes in the Louisiana delta plain to chronic river water influx
AN  - 223076895
AB  - To help evaluate effects of Mississippi River inputs to sustainability of coastal Louisiana ecosystems, we compared porewater and substrate quality of organic-rich Panicum hemitomon freshwater marshes inundated by river water annually for more than 30 years (Penchant basin, PB) or not during the same time (Barataria basin, BB). In the marshes receiving river water the soil environment was more reduced, the organic substrate was more decomposed and accumulated more sulfur. The porewater dissolved ammonium and orthophosphate concentrations were an order of magnitude higher and sulfide and alkalinity concentrations were more than twice as high in PB compared with BB marshes. The pH was higher and dissolved iron concentrations were more than an order of magnitude lower in PB marshes than in BB marshes. The influx of nutrient-rich river water did not enhance end-of-year above-ground standing biomass or vertical accretion rates of the shallow substrate. The differences in porewater chemistry and substrate quality are reasonably linked to the long-term influx of river water through biogeochemical processes and transformations involving alkalinity, nitrate and sulfate. The key factor is the continual replenishment of alkalinity, nitrate and sulfate via overland flow during high river stage each year for several weeks to more than 6 months. This leads to a reducing soil environment, pooling of the phytotoxin sulfide and inorganic nutrients in porewater, and internally generated alkalinity. Organic matter decomposition is enhanced under these conditions and root mats degraded. The more decomposed root mat makes these marshes more susceptible to erosion during infrequent high-energy events (for example hurricanes) and regular low-energy events, such as tides and the passage of weather fronts. Our findings were unexpected and, if generally applicable, suggest that river diversions may not be the beneficial mitigating agent of wetland restoration and conservation that they are anticipated to be.

T1  - Longitudinal changes in zooplankton distribution below a reservoir outfall with reference to river planktivory
AN  - 201096918
AB  - The fate and interactions with river organisms of zooplankton as they drift downriver from a reservoir on a fourth-order mountain stream (Hiji River, Japan) were investigated. Monthly samples were collected at the reservoir and six river sites, simultaneously, from May 2005 to May 2006. Aquatic macroinvertebrates and fish were colleted, and their stomach contents were analyzed in April and May, 2006, respectively. Drift from the reservoir was the primary source for the river plankton community; the abundance of zooplankton, particularly those of cladocerans and large rotifer, rapidly decreased within several kilometers of the dam. Analysis of the contents of fish stomachs showed that drifting zooplankton was the main food for fish, with strong food selectivity for cladocerans and large rotifers. However, fish and insect planktivores showed longitudinally different stomach contents, with progressively fewer zooplankton found in the stomachs at the downriver sites. The results suggest that the outflow of zooplankton from the reservoir is an important food source for the downstream predators, especially fish, but the drift of zooplankton and consequent food availability for the predators at lower sites are strongly limited by concentrated fish predation just below the reservoir dam.

T1  - Bottom-water Hypoxia Effects on Sediment-Water Interface Nitrogen Transformations in a Seasonally Hypoxic, Shallow Bay (Corpus Christi Bay, TX, USA)
AN  - 230001224
AB  - Bottom-water hypoxia effects on sediment-water interface nitrogen (N) transformations in Corpus Christi Bay (TX, USA) were examined using continuous-flow intact sediment core incubations. Sediment cores were collected from three sites in August 2002 (summer hypoxia) and April 2003 (normoxia). Oxygen (O^sub 2^) and hydrogen sulfide (H^sub 2^S) depth profiles were generated with microelectrodes. Membrane inlet mass spectrometry was used to measure sediment O^sub 2^ demand and net N^sub 2^ flux and combined with isotope pairing to determine potential denitrification and N fixation. Potential dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) was measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. Sediment O^sub 2^ penetration depths ranged from 5 to 10 mm. H^sub 2^S ranged from being present in overlying water and throughout the sediment column in August to not detectable in overlying water or sediment in April. Sediment O^sub 2^ demand was higher during bottom-water normoxia conditions versus hypoxia. Sediments were a significant source of NH^sub 4^+ to overlying water during hypoxia but not during normoxia. Net N^sub 2^ fixation was observed at one station in August and all stations in April. Denitrification rates were significantly higher during hypoxia at two of three sites. Potential DNRA was observed during both oxic states, but rates were significantly higher during hypoxia, which may reflect sulfide enhancement and absence of cation exchange with ^sup 14^NH^sub 4^+. DNRA may contribute to formation and maintenance of bottom-water hypoxic events in this system. These results show that N transformation pathways and rates change when bottom-water O2 concentrations drop to hypoxic levels. Since south Texas is a semiarid region with few episodic runoff events, these results indicate that Corpus Christi Bay sediments are a N source most of the year, and denitrification may drive N limitation between episodic runoff events.

T1  - Effectiveness and Kinetics of Ferrate as a Disinfectant for Ballast Water
AN  - 216074204; 18686931
AB  - This study examined whether ferrate could meet the international standards for successful ballast water treatment, including final concentrations of less than 1 CFU/mL of Enterococci, less than 2.5 CFU/mL of Escherichia coli, and less than 1 CFU/100 mL of Vibrio cholerae. Pure cultures of E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and V. cholerae, and a mixed culture of Enterococcus faecium and E. faecilis were grown in saline solution to simulate ballast water and were treated with dosages of ferrate ranging from 0.25 to 5.0 mg/L. A ferrate dose of 5 mg/L resulted in complete disinfection of all organisms tested, and smaller dosages were also very effective. Tailing was consistently observed, and the Hom's model (1972) appeared to most accurately represent the action of ferrate on these organisms. Salinity and pH did not adversely affect results, and regrowth was not a problem. Ferrate shows good potential as an effective disinfectant in the treatment of ballast water. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Population genetic structure of North American Ophiactis spp. brittle stars possessing hemoglobin
AN  - 208061428
AB  - With the discovery of previously unreported populations of hemoglobin-possessing Ophiactis from the Texas coast in the Gulf of Mexico, an investigation into its population structure, including populations of O. simplex from the Pacific coast of California and O. rubropoda from the Atlantic coast of Florida, was undertaken using DNA sequence data from the mitochondrial COI gene. The reconstructed haplotype network suggests that California populations contain the ancestral source of mtDNA variation, and there is no evidence of recent introductions into Texas. Population genetic analyses reveal the California, Florida, and Texas Ophiactis populations to each be significantly differentiated from one another. Sequence divergence among the three areas is shallower than would be predicted given biogeographic history. Texas and Florida populations are equally genetically diverged from California populations as they are to one another, despite the greater potential for gene flow between these areas. The genetic distinctiveness of the Texas populations and the concordance of this pattern with phylogeographic patterns in other brittle star systems indicate an isolated and independent evolutionary history and we hypothesize that the three geographic regions included in this study each serve as hypotheses of population-level lineages that remain to be tested with independent sources of data.

T1  - Stable isotope changes in freshwater shrimps (Exopalaemon modestus and Macrobrachium nipponensis): trophic pattern implications
AN  - 195886489
AB  - Trophic patterns of omnivorous freshwater shrimps, Exopalaemon modestus and Macrobrachium nipponensis, were investigated in two shallow eutrophic lakes by using stable isotope analysis. δ15N and δ13C of M. nipponensis and E. modestus increased with increasing body weight, which might be attributed to larger individuals ingesting organisms that feed higher up the food chain and/or increased assimilation of benthic food items with enriched isotopic signatures. Of the freshwater shrimps occurring in the studied lakes, those from Lake Taihu had significantly elevated δ15N and δ13C values (4.3[per thousand] and 1.8[per thousand], respectively) compared with those from the less eutrophic Lake Chaohu, indicating that the isotopic signature might partially reflect the trophic states of their habitats. Mixing model results suggested that the benthic food web provides the primary carbon source for both shrimp species, and that E. modestus assimilated relatively more pelagic food sources than M. nipponensis in these lakes.

T1  - Underwater Adhesive of Marine Organisms as the Vital Link Between Biological Science and Material Science
AN  - 208977452; 18278433
AB  - Marine sessile organisms naturally attach themselves to diverse materials in water by a technique that has so far remained unreproducible. Recent studies on the holdfast of marine sessile organisms have revealed natural concepts that are currently beyond our understanding with respect to the molecular design and macroscopic range. The combination of valuable and practical natural design of biotic adhesives as biomolecular materials, together with continuing efforts towards mimetic design, hold the promise of revolution for future materials. This review focuses on recent advances in the study of barnacle underwater cement, a protein complex whose constituents and the properties of individual components are being uncovered. A comparison is made with the model systems used by the mussel and tubeworm.  [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Evaluating the utility of stable isotope analyses of archived freshwater sample materials
AN  - 195890042
AB  - We evaluated the potential utility of stable isotope analysis of tissues commonly archived by aquatic biologists. Previous studies with chemically preserved samples have shown contradictory results, which present an obstacle for the use of archived sample materials. We tested the effects of ethanol and formalin preservation on zooplankton and of ethanol on benthic macroinvertebrate δ13C and δ15N values. We found that neither formalin nor ethanol had a significant effect on δ13C and δ15N values of preserved zooplankton. Nor did ethanol significantly affect δ13C or δ15N values of macroinvertebrates. However, ethanol preservation slightly, but significantly decreased C:N ratios of both zooplankton and macroinvertebrates, probably reflecting some extraction of lipids. Overall, the effects of preservatives on δ13C and δ15N values that we observed were minor. We also compared δ13C and δ15N values analysed from roach scales and perch operculum bones with those analysed from muscle tissue. Decalcification of scales and operculum bones only slightly improved our comparison to muscle tissue δ13C and δ15N values. Decalcified scales had slightly higher δ13C and lower δ15N values. Similarly, decalcified operculum bones showed slightly increased δ13C and decreased δ15N values to those for fish muscle. Our results confirm that scales and operculum bones can provide a suitable proxy for fish muscle in isotope studies with minor correction. We conclude that various archived sample materials can indeed be used with confidence for historical reconstructions of freshwater food webs by stable isotope analysis. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Assessment of the exposure of two fish species to metals pollution in the Ogun river catchments, Ketu, Lagos, Nigeria
AN  - 2664668902
AB  - The concentrations of metals (Ca, Cd, Fe, Mn, Pb and Zn) were determined by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry in water, sediments and fish samples in the Ogun river catchments, Ketu, Lagos, which is an important bird nesting, fishing and drinking water source. The results show that the southern tip bothering the Lagos lagoon is where the highest metal concentrations are found in the fish species (Tilapia sp. and Chrysichthys sp.), whereas the Agboyi creek segment near the lagoon with higher surrounding human population density recorded higher levels of metals in sediments and water samples. The two fish species accumulated different amounts of metals. However, the differences were not statistically different at p<0.05. There is a significant correlation (p<0.05) for Cd concentration in water. The concentrations of Pb in sampling points 3 and 4 as well as Cd, Mn and Fe in all six sampling points exceeds the World Health Organization (WHO) limits for drinking water. Levels of metals obtained for sediments are within the range reported for Nigeria’s river sediments. Based on this study, the human risks for heavy metals in the harvested fish species from the Ogun river catchments, Ketu, are low for now as the concentrations were below the recommended Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) maximum limits for Pb (0.5 mg/Kg), Cd (0.5 mg/Kg), and Zn (30 mg/Kg) in fish.

T1  - POPs in Mountain Soils from the Alps and Andes: Suggestions for a 'Precipitation Effect' on Altitudinal Gradients
AN  - 208163826
AB  - POPs are still a priority environmental problem, but can be used as a scientific tool for understanding the distribution phenomena. Both high mountains and polar areas are seen as priority zones for contamination studies. In this context, two altitudinal series of soil samples were analysed for several classes of Persistent Organic Pollutants (PCBs, DDTs, HCHs, HCB and chlordane). Two transects were carried out - one in the Peruvian Andes (Cordillera Blanca) and the other in the Italian Alps (Mount Legnone). In these two areas, POP composition and levels both gave different results, linked to regional emission history. The Italian samples were characterized by high levels of industrial type compounds, and by surprisingly high DDT contamination, due to a defined consistent local source in Northern Italy. The Peruvian samples, on the other hand, were characterized by generally low POP levels with relatively high DDT contamination. The concentration increase in line with elevation was evident only in the Italian transect, where higher precipitation intensities and an increasingly higher precipitation gradient in accordance with altitude was found present. Precipitations are considered a key factor for enhancing the condensation effect at high altitudes and for reducing summer revolatilisation, as they lower soil temperature. In the Italian altitudinal gradient, evidence of fractionation processes, with a shift of the PCB composition towards less chlorinated congeners, and a vegetation effect with a mean woodland/grassland enrichment factor between 2 and 4 were also observed.

T1  - Shell gaping behaviour of Pinna nobilis L., 1758: circadian and circalunar rhythms revealed by in situ monitoring
AN  - 208062102
AB  - Gaping activity of bivalve molluscs is closely related to physiological process such as breathing, nutrition, responses to environmental stimuli and follows rhythmic cycles in many species. Although the alternation of Sun and Moon is the major entraining agent for the daily living clock-driven rhythms, cyclic extrinsic environmental factors can also modulate gaping activity. Therefore, laboratory experimental conditions can alter the natural behaviour of bivalves, hindering the interpretation of observations. Many features of Pinna nobilis physiology are poorly known, gaping activity not being an exception. To reduce the knowledge gap on this regard, we performed a study on the species gaping activity. The research was designed to be carried out in situ, in order to avoid the interference of laboratory conditions in the observations. To this end, we designed and fabricated a new electronic system composed by a data logger and a sensor formed by multiple reed switches activated by a single magnet. The system is autonomous and can record gaping activity of subtidal bivalves in potentially any type of subtidal environment. Furthermore, it requires little framework for the installation. With this system, we monitored 10 individuals in periods ranging between 3 and 21 days, for up to a total of 98 days. The records have shown that far from being all day open, as previously suggested, P. nobilis follows marked circadian and circalunar rhythms of gaping activity. Individuals usually close the valves during night, sometimes for more than 12 h. The repetition of patterns observed made it possible to distinguish between two main behaviours: (1) night-closing related with sunset and (2) night-opening related with the Moon visible in the sky with the disc illuminated more than 50%. Another two less common trends were also observed: (3) day-closing and (4) night-opening with no visible Moon. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Denitrification, dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium, and nitrogen fixation along a nitrate concentration gradient in a created freshwater wetland
AN  - 223076413
AB  - Wetlands are often highly effective nitrogen (N) sinks. In the Lake Waco Wetland (LWW), near Waco, Texas, USA, nitrate (NO                            3                            -                         ) concentrations are reduced by more than 90% in the first 500 m downstream of the inflow, creating a distinct gradient in NO                            3                            -                          concentration along the flow path of water. The relative importance of sediment denitrification (DNF), dissimilatory NO                            3                            -                          reduction to ammonium (DNRA), and N2 fixation were examined along the NO                            3                            -                          concentration gradient in the LWW. "Potential DNF" (hereafter potDNF) was observed in all months and ranged from 54 to 278 μmol N m-2 h-1. "Potential DNRA" (hereafter potDNRA) was observed only in summer months and ranged from 1.3 to 33 μmol N m-2 h-1. Net N2 flux ranged from 184 (net denitrification) to -270 (net N2 fixation) μmol N m-2 h-1. Nitrogen fixation was variable, ranging from 0 to 426 μmol N m-2 h-1, but high rates ranked among the highest reported for aquatic sediments. On average, summer potDNRA comprised only 5% (±2% SE) of total NO                            3                            -                          loss through dissimilatory pathways, but was as high as 36% at one site where potDNF was consistently low. Potential DNRA was higher in sediments with higher sediment oxygen demand (r                         2 = 0.84), and was related to NO                            3                            -                          concentration in overlying water in one summer (r                         2 = 0.81). Sediments were a NO                            3                            -                          sink and accounted for 50% of wetland NO                            3                            -                          removal (r                         2 = 0.90). Sediments were an NH                            4                            +                          source, but the wetland was often a net NH                            4                            +                          sink. Although DNRA rates in freshwater wetlands may rival those observed in estuarine systems, the importance of DNRA in freshwater sediments appears to be minor relative to DNF. Furthermore, sediment N2 fixation can be extremely high when NO                            3                            -                          in overlying water is consistently low. The data suggest that newly fixed N can support sustained N transformation processes such as DNF and DNRA when surface water inorganic N supply rates are low. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Mytilus galloprovincialis as a Bioindicator of Microbiological Pollution of Coastal Waters: A Study Conducted in the Salento Peninsula (Italy)
AN  - 210853782
AB  - One of the problems dealing with traditional water-monitoring methods is the need to collect water samples at the precise moment that faecal contamination is actually present; for this reason, the use of Mytilus galloprovincialis as an indicator of previously high bacteria concentrations in coastal seawaters was examined. These molluscs are able to integrate the fluctuations in pollutants, they are good representatives of the sampling area because they are sedentary, and they offer the advantage of being resistant to pollution. The research was conducted from September 2001 to October 2002, twice a month, in two coastal areas of Salento (Apulia, Italy), near the discharge channels. We analysed both natural and cultivated mussels. The latter were placed in cages, after checking their starting level of microbiological pollution. Bacteriological analyses were conducted simultaneously on mussels and their ambient water to detect total coliforms, faecal coliforms, faecal streptococci, and Escherichia coli. The abundance of bacteria investigated was always higher within mussels than in the surrounding water where levels were sometimes undetectable. These results confirm the ability of mussels to concentrate and to retain bacteria into their tissues (recorders of present or even past microbiological pollution). Therefore, mussels can enable to detect a bacterial contamination that might be missed by standard water-monitoring methods, and we suggest they be included in routine microbiological investigations of coastal seawaters even in areas where these species aren't widely distributed.

T1  - Crustacean Social Behavioral Changes in Response to Isolation
AN  - 220999635; 17928525
AB  - Periods of isolation during which animals have no social contact are common in the design of behavioral experiments. They are used, for example, to test memory and recognition responses, or to ensure a baseline condition before experimental manipulations commence. We investigated the effect of isolation periods on the aggressive behavior of matched pairs of the crayfish Cherax destructor in two contexts. The first experiment tested the effects of a period of isolation between two encounters. The second experiment tested the effects of isolation before an encounter by pairing one crayfish from a communal living environment with another crayfish from an isolated one. Fight outcome and aggression levels were analyzed, resulting in three conclusions about the social biology of C. destructor. First, encounters between familiar opponents are influenced by the outcome of the familiarization fight for about 2 weeks. Second, the level of aggression and the outcome of an encounter are affected over different time frames. Third, individuals that are isolated before an encounter can be disadvantaged. These data suggest that isolation, or events that occur during periods of isolation, affect multiple elements of social behavior in C. destructor. This suggestion has implications for the interpretation of previous results and future studies in crustaceans and other taxa. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Grazing of two toxic Planktothrix species by Daphnia pulicaria: potential for bloom control and transfer of microcystins
AN  - 220277335
AB  - The role of zooplankton in the control of cyanobacterial blooms and the transfer of cyanotoxins to higher trophic levels are of great importance to the management of water resources. Many studies have focused on the cyanobacterium Microcystis, but few have examined the interactions between zooplankton and filamentous cyanobacteria. In this study, we provide experimental evidence for the potential grazing of two toxic strains of filamentous cyanobacteria, Planktothrix rubescens and P. agardhii, by Daphnia pulicaria, and for transfer of toxins in the planktonic food chain. We determined clearance rates (CRs) by adult and juvenile D. pulicaria of the two Planktothrix strains, Scenedesmus acutus and a mixture of S. acutus cells with P. rubescens culture filtrate. Filament lengths were analyzed, and microcystin (MCY) presence in Daphnia was assessed using the Protein Phosphatase-2A (PP-2A) Inhibition Assay. The two Planktothrix strains were equally grazed by D. pulicaria, but at lower CRs than S. acutus. Potential anti-grazer toxins in P. rubescens filtrate did not inhibit Daphnia grazing. Small P. rubescens (<100 μm) filaments were preferentially grazed by adult D. pulicaria, suggesting their limited ability to control a Planktothrix population during a bloom. Large quantities of MCYs were found in unstarved Daphnia previously exposed to Planktothrix, whereas quantities were significantly smaller in individuals starved for 24 h before preservation. This indicated a potential for transfer of toxins in the food chain by Daphnia, especially immediately after ingestion of toxic cyanobacteria.

T1  - A Phaeocystis globosa bloom associated with upwelling in the subtropical South Atlantic Bight
AN  - 220246900
AB  - We observed an unusual, subtropical bloom of Phaeocystis globosa Scherffel during a strong upwelling event and confirmed its identity using morphological, physiological and genetic traits. This low-latitude bloom of P. globosa colonies occurred on the South Atlantic Bight continental shelf during the summer of 2003. Maximum chlorophyll a concentration measured during this subsurface bloom was 11.37 μg L-1  at 31 m depth. Divers reported abundant flocculent material below the steep thermocline, and this material was identified as Phaeocystis sp. using microscopy. Using morphological and physiological traits as well as the sequence of the 18S small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (GenBank Accession # EF100712), this phytoplankton was identified as P. globosa. Interactions of physical and biological conditions may restrict low-latitude P. globosa blooms to strong upwelling events.

T1  - Spatial and temporal genetic homogeneity in the Arctic surfclam (Mactromeris polynyma)
AN  - 208063319
AB  - Commercially harvested marine bivalve populations show a broad range of population-genetic patterns that may be driven by planktonic larval dispersal (gene flow) or by historical (genetic drift) and ecological processes (selection). We characterized microsatellite genetic variation among populations and year classes of the commercially harvested Arctic surfclam, Mactromeris polynyma, in order to test the relative significance of gene flow and drift on three spatial scales: within commercially harvested populations in the northwest Atlantic; among Atlantic populations; and between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. We found small nonsignificant genetic subdivision among eight populations from the northwest Atlantic (F ST = 0.002). All of these Atlantic populations were highly significantly differentiated from a northeast Pacific population (F ST = 0.087); all populations showed high inbreeding coefficients (F IS = 0.432). We tested one likely source of heterozygote deficits by aging individual clams and exploring genetic variation among age classes within populations (a temporal Wahlund effect). Populations showed strikingly different patterns of age structure, but we found little differentiation among age classes. In one case, we were able to analyze genetic diversity between age classes older or younger than the advent of intensive commercial harvesting. The results generally suggest spatially broad and temporally persistent genetic homogeneity of these bivalves. We discuss the implications of the results for the biology and management of surfclam populations. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Kinetic of Biomarker Responses in Juveniles of the Fish Sparus aurata Exposed to Contaminated Sediments
AN  - 375588993; 17171271
AB  - Sediments in the National Park of the Atlantic Islands (Galicia, Spain) were affected by the spill of the tanker Prestige (November, 2002) and still present high levels of Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The adverse effects associated with the contaminants in sediments were tested using a chronic bioassay, exposing juveniles of the fish Sparus aurata (seabream). A toxicokinetic approach is proposed to evaluate sediment quality by linking chemical and ecotoxicological data along the time. Sediment samples were physicochemically characterized and the concentration of contaminants (Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons - PAHs - and metals) was measured. Fishes were exposed to contaminated sediments, and samples from different tissues were collected every 15 days throughout the 60 days that lasted the experiment. A biomarker of exposure (ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activity - EROD activity) and a biomarker of effect (histopathology) were analyzed during the exposure period. Results show a relationship between the biomarkers and the concentrations in sediments of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons--PAHs. Besides, the toxicokinetic approach links biomarkers response providing information about the relationship between the detoxification process and the damages observed in the different tissues. The frequency of the histological damage is highest when the EROD activity slightly decreases in accordance with the mechanism of detoxification of this enzymatic system against PAHs and other organic contaminants.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The Use of Active Metabolism and Swimming Activity to Evaluate the Toxicity of Dodecyl Benzene Sodium Sulfonate (LAS-C12) on the Mugil platanus (Mullet) According to Temperature and Salinity
AN  - 216079127; 17710915
AB  - Active metabolism and swimming activity were used to study the effects of dodecyl benzene sodium sulfonate (LAS-C12) in Mugil platanus, a species traditionally considered as estuarine. The effects of exposure to different concentrations of LAS-C12 (0.0, 1.0, 2.5, and 5.0 mg/L) on the active metabolism and swimming activity of Mugil platanus were evaluated. The active metabolism and swimming activity were estimated through experiments conducted on each of 9 possible combinations of three temperatures (35, 20, and 15°C) and three salinities (35, 20, and 5[per thousand]). The results show that the active metabolism increases according to the LAS-C12 concentration in all temperatures and salinities studied. At the highest tested concentration (5.0 mg/L), the active metabolism was 111%; 84.8 and 105% higher than the control, at 35[per thousand] salinity at the three temperatures. However, the swimming activity decreased according to the LAS-C12 concentration in all temperatures and salinities studied. At the highest tested concentration, the swimming activity was 78.6, 73.6, and 78.7% less than the control, at 25°C at the three salinities. The active metabolism and swimming activity averages, achieved in the different salinities studied, were not significantly different, as a result of the LAS-C12 concentration. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The quick and the dead: larval mortality due to turbulent tidal transport
AN  - 224120484
AB  - Marine populations are typically connected over greater spatial scales than their terrestrial counterparts due to many species having a highly dispersive, planktonic larval phase. However, high levels of larval mortality in the plankton may reduce connectivity between populations. The effect of turbulence on larval mortality was investigated under natural conditions in a field experiment. Larvae were collected before and after being subjected to turbulent tidal flow from a marine reserve, with differential mortality being observed between taxa. Thin-shelled veligers of gastropods and bivalves showed significantly increased mortality, while barnacle nauplii and cyprids, bryozoan cyphonaute larvae and polychaete trochophores showed no effect of turbulent tidal transport. Where appropriate, marine reserve design should account for the reduced connectivity between populations associated with turbulent tidal transport between reserve and adjacent areas.

T1  - Patterns of microzooplankton growth in dilution experiments across a trophic gradient: Implications for herbivory studies
AN  - 208064788
AB  - To investigate the growth and grazing patterns of microzooplankton (MZP) in environments of differing productivity, dilution experiments measuring phytoplankton growth (mu) and grazing mortality (m) rates were performed using samples from contrasting locations along the Texas coast. Samples were collected from estuaries, coastal lagoons and offshore Gulf of Mexico locations in the spring and summer of 2001. MZP growth rates were determined in each dilution treatment. Although MZP biomass changed over time in most dilution treatments, adjusting mu and m for the actual grazer gradient (represented by geometric mean MZP biomass) did not cause a significant deviation from the nominal dilution gradient. Likewise, these adjustments did not yield significant regressions where none existed before adjustment. The dynamics of MZP taxonomic groups (ciliates, dinoflagellates) and size categories differed suggesting that in some cases internal predation may lead to trophic cascades. MZP biomass was higher in productive coastal waters and included a larger proportion of dinoflagellates than in the oligotrophic, ciliate-dominated waters of the Gulf of Mexico. The MZP biomass-to-chlorophyll a ratio was lowest in the hypereutrophic Nueces River, where MZP biomass significantly increased in all dilution treatments (net growth rates up to 2 day-1) suggesting a strong top-down control. In the brown-tide dominated Upper Laguna Madre and the oligotrophic seagrass-dominated Lower Laguna Madre MZP growth was decoupled from that of phytoplankton. At these sites, MZP were likely fueled by bacterial carbon and mixotrophy, respectively. Observing the growth response of MZP in dilution experiments can provide insight into trophic structure and efficiency of the microbial food web. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Effects of Salinity on Spawning and Early Development of the Tube-Building Polychaete Hydroides elegans in Hong Kong: Not Just the Sperm's Fault?
AN  - 220999978; 17438207
AB  - Ambient salinities drop dramatically during monsoon season in Hong Kong coastal waters, posing a number of problems for externally fertilizing species like the polychaete Hydroides elegans. In this study, we investigated (1) whether adults would retain their gametes when external salinity dropped to levels too low to support fertilization and development, and (2) whether failure of development at low salinity reflects a failure of fertilization or a failure of fertilized eggs to cleave. Adults released eggs and sperm in the laboratory even at the lowest salinity tested, a practical salinity (S) of 5, and yet very few eggs cleaved at salinities below about 22. By mixing gametes at high salinity and then transferring the fertilized eggs to low-salinity seawater, we found that salinities below about 22 reduced the percentage of fertilized eggs that cleaved. Similarly, mixing gametes at salinities as low as 15 and then transferring the eggs to full-strength seawater (S = 30) rescued a substantial number of eggs, many more of which cleaved after their transfer to the higher salinity. The results suggest that failure of early development at low salinity in this species in large part reflects an inability of newly fertilized eggs to complete meiosis and cleave, rather than simply a failure of fertilization.

T1  - In Situ-Based Effects Measures: Determining the Ecological Relevance of Measured Responses
AN  - 210706261
AB  - The aim of this review is to examine how the choice of test species and study design employed in the use of in situ approaches in ecological risk assessment can maximize the ecological relevance of data. We provide a framework to define and assess ecological relevance that permits study designs to remain focused on the ecological question being addressed. This framework makes explicit the linkages between effects at lower levels of biological organization and higher-order ecological effects at the population, community, and ecosystem levels. The usefulness of this framework is illustrated by reference to specific examples from aquatic ecotoxicology. The use of models as both interpretive and predictive tools is discussed, with suggestions of appropriate methods for different protection goals. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Gaining integrated understanding of <i>Phaeocystis</i> spp. (Prymnesiophyceae) through model-driven laboratory and mesocosm studies
AN  - 2665369124
AB  - Knowledge of the complex life cycle of Phaeocystis is a key to understanding its role in marine ecosystems and global biogeochemistry. An existing life cycle model was modified and used to integrate understanding of the Phaeocystis life cycle. In model-driven research, models expose gaps in our understanding, empirical studies ensue, and feedback improves understanding. Following this scheme, three facets of the life cycle model were examined here. With four exceptions, the empirical studies described have been presented in other literature citations. The first facet involved testing for the existence of a process or producing its description. These studies included: demonstration of in vitro colony division in Phaeocystis pouchetii, description of in vitro change in colony shape for P. pouchetii associated with senescence, determining which P. pouchetii life stage is vulnerable to viral infection and lysis, and an experiment designed to determine whether the sediment could be a source of new Phaeocystis colonies to overlying waters; results suggested that more-detailed investigation of benthic particles as a physical substrate for colony formation is warranted. The second facet involved investigation of process rate quantification or process control parameters. Process rate quantification included measurements of colony division rate and growth rate using mesocosm-derived colonies. Process control experiments included testing diatom frustule enhancement of P. pouchetii colony formation from solitary cells, and investigation of mesozooplanktonic suppression and microzooplanktonic enhancement of Phaeocystis globosa colony formation by planktonic grazer infochemicals. The third facet pertained to the molecular identification of genetic differences between single cells and colonies of P. globosa. These studies were designed to provide insight to the question of control factors involved in the transition between single cell and colonial life stages. The life cycle model provided a ready place to incorporate new insights and understanding from empirical studies into an existing model, and can be used to improve simulation models of the direct and indirect effects of Phaeocystis on global biogeochemistry.

T1  - Fuzzy risk-based decision-making approach for selection of drinking water disinfectants
AN  - 1943098585
AB  - The potential effects of disinfection by-products (DBP) on human health have become a serious concern over the last three decades. In addition to the chronic cancer risk, several acute effects such as cardiac anomalies, stillbirths, miscarriages, low birth weights and pre-term deliveries have also been reported as a result of exposure to the DBP. Although several disinfectants including chlorine, ozone, ultraviolet ray (UV) radiation, chloramine and chlorine dioxide are available to supply safe drinking water, comparative evaluations of these disinfectants and their application approaches for a particular source of water is rare. This may be due to the variability associated with predicting DBP formation, health effects from DBP exposure, cost and disinfection performance of various disinfectants used in public water supply systems; and/or the knowledge gap in the assessment and comparison of risks associated with specific disinfection strategies. In this study, a framework for comparative evaluation of disinfectants and their application approaches has been developed through incorporation of human health risk from DBP exposure, cost of disinfection process, technical feasibility and disinfection performance. A fuzzy synthetic evaluation technique has been incorporated where fuzzy triangular membership functions were developed to capture uncertainties of the basic attributes. This paper compared three disinfection approaches: chlorination, chloramination and granular activated carbon with post chlorination through a multi-stage hierarchy risk model in which the analytical hierarchy process has been used to determine the relative importance of various attributes at different hierarchy levels. Then the best disinfection approach has been outlined. This evaluation was found to be sensitive to the assignment of relative importance.

As we enter the 21st "biocentury", with issues such as biodiversity and biotechnology growing in public profile, it is important to reflect on the immense ecological, medical and economic importance of invertebrates. Efforts to understand the diverse biology of invertebrates come from many directions, including Nobel Prize winning developmental biology, research to control insects that threaten human health and food supplies, aquaculture opportunities and also within ecotoxicology. In the latter context, this special journal volume highlights the importance of addressing endocrine disruption in aquatic invertebrates, from molecular and cellular biomarkers to population-relevant adverse effects. The contributors to this special volume have provided an excellent assessment of both the fundamental endocrinology and applied ecotoxicology of many aquatic invertebrate groups. On the premise that reproductive success is ultimately the vital population parameter, this chapter gives a personal view of key gaps in knowledge in invertebrate reproductive and developmental endocrinology and ecotoxicology. Based on current knowledge, there are four key issues that need to be prioritised within aquatic ecotoxicology: (1) a wider assessment of the reproductive status of invertebrates in both freshwater and coastal ecosystems; (2) prioritisation of laboratory studies in OECD and other regulatory test organisms, including basic endocrinology and ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) research; (3) development and validation of mechanistic biomarkers that can be used as "signposts" to help prioritise species and chronic test endpoint selection, and help link data from laboratory and field studies; and (4) develop a comparative invertebrate toxicology database utilising the prioritised reference chemicals from the EDIETA workshop, encompassing the diverse modes-of-action pertinent to endocrine disrupter testing in both aquatic arthropod and non-arthropod invertebrates.

T1  - Mechanism of an epibiont burden: Crepidula fornicata increases byssus thread production by Mytilus edulis
AN  - 195501185
AB  - Epibionts of mussels can have detrimental effects on their basibionts, such as reduced growth rates, lower fecundity, increased mortality and an enhanced risk of dislodgement of the overgrown bivalves due to stronger hydrodynamic forces. In blue mussels Mytilus edulis, the epibiotic American slipper limpet Crepidula fornicata reduces growth and survival. In a field experiment we tested the hypothesis that an enhanced byssus thread production with high energetic costs for the mussels due slipper limpet epibionts is the underlying mechanism for the epibiont burden. Byssus thread production in overgrown mussels was twice as high as in unfouled M. edulis (11 ± 0.9 and 5.4 ± 0.6 byssus threads/mussel/day, respectively). A control experiment revealed intermediate byssus thread production (8.4 ± 0.8 byssus threads/mussel/day) in mussels cleaned of C. fornicata at the beginning of the experiments, indicating that C. fornicata is responsible for the effects observed. We conclude that increased byssus production in fouled M. edulis is a functional response to higher drag caused by epibionts and that it is associated with increased energy expenditure that reduces allocation of resources for other processes such as growth, reproduction and survival. Such indirect effects of epibionts, mediated by an enhanced byssus production, may be widespread in byssus-producing bivalves, with important implications for their population dynamics.

AB  - (2006) proposed a new method to solve the transient free convection MHD flow of a dissipative fluid along a semi-infinite vertical plate with mass transfer, the surface of which is exposed to a constant heat flux.  The influences of the viscous dissipation, the buoyancy ratio parameter, as well as the Schmidt number and magnetic parameter on the heat and mass transfer and on the time needed to reach the steady-state were discussed.  (2006) presented an unstructured finite volume model for quasi-2D tidal flow with wet-dry fronts and turbulence modeling and applied to the Crouch-Roach estuarine system in Essex, U.K. Two depth averaged turbulence models, a mixing length model and a k-epsilon model, were used in the numerical calculations.

T1  - A toxicity and hazard assessment of fourteen pharmaceuticals to Xenopus laevis larvae
AN  - 214675838; 17077997
AB  - The toxicity of fourteen widely used human pharmaceuticals was determined using the Frog Embryo Teratogenesis Assay-Xenopus (FETAX). Stage 9 Xenopus blastulae were exposed for 96 h to single concentrations of commonly prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), statin blood lipid regulators, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, antibiotics, a stimulant, and an anti-epileptic. Toxicity, teratogenicity, minimum concentration to inhibit growth, and types and severity of associated malformations were determined. EC
10s ranged from 3.0 mg/l to >100 mg/l and LC10s ranged from 3.6 mg/l to >100 mg/l. Toxicity varied between and within compound class of pharmaceutical. The fluoroquinolones, stimulants, anti-epileptics, and antibiotics tested were determined to be nontoxic and non-teratogenic at singular, water-soluble concentrations. The hazard quotients (HQ) for the pharmaceuticals ranged from 6.10 × 10
-7 to 1.6 × 10-4, all of which are orders of magnitude below EPA's levels for concern for harm to aquatic animals. Thus, based on the data from the present study, concentrations of individual pharmaceuticals currently detected in surface water are far below concentrations of effective and lethal concentrations.

T1  - Shorebirds, snails, and the amphipod (<i>Corophium volutator</i>) in the upper Bay of Fundy: top–down vs. bottom–up factors, and the influence of compensatory interactions on mudflat ecology
AN  - 821259076
AB  - During their annual mid- to late-summer southward migration, Semipalmated Sandpipers (Calidris pusilla) feed intensively on the amphipod Corophium volutator on intertidal mudflats in the Bay of Fundy. Corophium, in turn, feed on diatoms and bacteria. Using a series of bird exclosures and fertilizer addition, we examined top–down and bottom–up effects, and investigated the presence of a trophic cascade in the mudflat community during the period when birds are abundant. Although both top–down and bottom–up forces were present in this system, neither transmitted beyond a single trophic link. Predation by shorebirds, which may be less size-selective than previously thought, reduced Corophium abundance in control plots by approximately 80% relative to exclosures, but most other species were unaffected. Shorebird predation did not result in an increase in diatom abundance, as predicted under the trophic cascade hypothesis. Fertilizer increased diatom abundance, but had no effect on Corophium abundance or bird predation, and little effect on other mudflat invertebrates. The only indirect effect observed was on mud snails (Ilyanassa obsoleta), which, by rapidly responding to changes in diatom abundance, compensated for both bird exclusion and fertilizer addition, and prevented the trophic cascade. This population response by snails, possibly stemming from competition with Corophium, probably contributed to the stability of the community. Our results provide an example of short-term compensation in a simple intertidal community, and highlight the importance of considering direct and indirect effects in community ecological studies. We conclude that while compensatory interactions that block trophic cascades may be more common in more complex ecosystems, they are not restricted to them.

T1  - Trophic links in the lowland River Meuse (Belgium): assessing the role of bacteria and protozoans in planktonic food webs
AN  - 220278207
AB  - Trophic interactions within the plankton of the lowland River Meuse (Belgium) were measured in spring and summer 2001. Consumption of bacteria by protozoa was measured by monitoring the disappearance of 3H-thymidine-labelled bacteria. Metazooplankton bacterivory was assessed using 0.5-µm fluorescent microparticles (FMPs), and predation of metazooplankton on ciliates was measured using natural ciliate assemblages labelled with FMPs as tracer food. Grazing of metazooplankton on flagellates was determined through in situ incubations with manipulated metazooplankton densities. Protozooplankton bacterivory varied between 6.08 and 53.90 mg C m-3 day-1 (i.e. from 0.12 to 0.86 g C-1 bacteria g C-1 protozoa day-1). Metazooplankton, essentially rotifers, grazing on bacteria was negligible compared with grazing by protozoa (∼1000 times lower). Predation of rotifers on heterotrophic flagellates (HFs) was generally low (on average 1.77 mg C m-3 day-1, i.e. 0.084 g C-1 flagellates g C-1 rotifers day-1), the higher contribution of HF in the diet of rotifers being observed when Keratella cochlearis was the dominant metazooplankter. Predation of rotifers on ciliates was low in spring samples (0.56 mg C m-3 day-1, i.e. 0.014 g C-1 ciliates g C-1 rotifers day-1) in contrast to measurements performed in July (8.72 mg C m-3 day-1, i.e. 0.242 g C-1 ciliates g C-1 rotifers day-1). The proportion of protozoa in the diet of rotifers was low compared with that of phytoplankton (<30% of total carbon ingestion) except when phytoplankton biomass decreased below the incipient limiting level (ILL) of the main metazooplantonic species. In such conditions, protozoa (mainly ciliates) constituted ∼50% of total rotifer diet. These results give evidence that microbial organisms play a significant role within the planktonic food web of a eutrophic lowland river, ciliates providing an alternative food for metazooplankton when phytoplankton becomes scarce.

T1  - Identification of bivalve species at an early developmental stage through PCR-SSCP and sequence analysis of partial 18S rDNA
AN  - 208064988
AB  - The notorious difficulties encountered in species identification of bivalve larvae through morphological characters have given rise to several alternative molecular approaches. In the present work, we propose a method based on PCR-SSCP combined with sequencing of partial 18S rDNA region, in which a large number of larvae can be scored and species identified with minimum sequencing effort. A primer set was developed to amplify a taxonomically informative 18S region of fragment size suitable for high resolution PCR-SSCP. The method developed is fast processing  and has the potential of identifying most species present in a plankton sample with low economic efforts. Those species for which partial 18S sequences are not yet available from GenBank, can be identified in families or at higher categories. The method was also tested on nine species and two subspecies of commercial importance in Italy to be carried out by the use of PCR-SSCP alone without sequencing.

T1  - Morphological and mitochondrial-DNA analysis of the Indo-West Pacific rock oysters (Ostreidae: Saccostrea species)
AN  - 195516600
AB  - Species of Saccostrea are common oysters on Indo-Pacific rocky shores. The taxonomy of this genus is unclear, however, because of morphological plasticity among its constituent species. Oyster samples with distinct morphotypes were collected from shores experiencing different degrees of wave exposure in Japan, Taiwan, China, Vietnam, Singapore and Australia. Intraspecific and interspecific variations in shell characters have been identified. Only S. kegaki could be readily differentiated from S. cucullata-B, S. cucullata-C and S. mordax by multivariate shell allometric analyses. Phylogenetic analyses using partial mitochondrial 16S DNA sequences of approximately 513 base pairs identified two clades that correspond to superspecies, i.e. putative S. cucullata and putative S. mordax, comprising nine and two lineages from the Indo-West Pacific, respectively. These are S. cucullata-A, B, C, D, E, F, G, S. kegaki and S. glomerata in one clade, and S. mordax-A and B in the other. Interspecific sequence divergence (Kimura-2-parameter values) between lineages ranged from 1.02% to 11.74%. Both S. cucullata-C and S. kegaki are restricted to the northern hemisphere, whereas S. glomerata seems to be a temperate species from the southern hemisphere. S. cucullata-D occurs only in Taiwan. Other species, i.e. S. cucullata-A, B, D, E and F and S. mordax-A and B, have a wide range on rocky shores in the tropical and subtropical Western Pacific and in both northern and southern hemispheres.

T1  - How parasitism and pollution affect the physiological homeostasis of aquatic hosts
AN  - 213507393; 16768858
AB  - Abstract

              
Parasitism poses a serious threat to hosts under certain circumstances, while the well-being of organisms is also negatively affected by environmental pollution. Little information is available on the simultaneous effects of parasites and pollutants on the physiological homeostasis of organisms. The present paper demonstrates that parasites: (i) may influence the metabolism of pollutants in infected hosts, (ii) interact with pollution in synergistic or antagonistic ways, and (iii) may induce physiological reactions in hosts which were thought to be pollutant-induced. Experimental studies on the uptake and accumulation of metals by fish reveal that fish infected with acanthocephalans have lower metal levels than uninfected hosts; e.g. Pomphorhynchus laevis reduces lead levels in fish bile, thereby diminishing or impeding the hepatic intestinal cycling of lead, which may reduce the quantity of metals available for fish. Alterations in pollutant uptake and accumulation in different intermediate and final hosts due to parasites are thus very important in the field of ecotoxicology. In addition to such alterations, there is a close interaction between the effects of pollutants and parasites which seems to be mediated at least partly by the endocrine system, which itself is closely related to the immune system in fish. Laboratory studies on eels experimentally infected with the swimbladder nematode Anguillicola crassus reveal that toxic chemicals such as polychlorinated biphenyls produce immunosuppressive effects which facilitate parasite infection. Similarly, an increase in serum cortisol concentration in eels due to chemical exposure and infection is correlated with decreasing levels of anti-A. crassus antibodies. Furthermore, parasites are able to elicit physiological changes which are attributed to chemicals with endocrine disrupting activity, e.g. the cestode Ligula intestinalis is known to suppress gonad development in roach. The most thoroughly documented examples of endocrine disruption in wild fish are in roach, and it is conceivable that this disruption is not only due to chemical activity but also to parasites such as L. intestinalis or species of the phylum Microspora.

T1  - Pollutant-induced effects on immunological and physiological interactions in aquatic host-trematode systems: implications for parasite transmission
AN  - 213507354; 16768857
AB  - Abstract

              
Under conditions of pollution both host and parasite are susceptible to the pathogenic effects of toxicants, which in turn may result in detrimental changes to their immunological and physiological processes. Digenetic trematodes, which encompass species of both medical and economic importance, possess complex life cycles and are common parasites of both vertebrates and molluscs. The combined stress induced by pollution and parasitism influences the physiology of the host which can have implications not only on host survival but also on the functional biology of resident parasite populations. The present paper reviews the effects of pollutants on the immunology and physiology in both vertebrate and molluscan host-trematode systems and the implications for parasite transmission.

T1  - MADRYNOMYA BRUNETI N. GEN. AND SP. (BIVALVIA: ?MODIOMORPHIDAE): A MESOZOIC SURVIVOR IN THE TERTIARY OF PATAGONIA?
AN  - 231090867
AB  - Madrynomya bruneti n. gen. and sp. is an undescribed bivalve collected from the late Miocene Puerto Madryn Formation in northern Patagonia. The specimens were collected together with other generally well-preserved mollusks from a parauthochtonous assemblage within a fine-grained sandstone. Based on their unique shell morphology, the specimens are placed in the Modiomorphoidea, a group of bivalves known only from the Paleozoic and Mesozoic. This conclusion is based on comparisons with other bivalve taxa such as Mytiloida, Dreissenidae, Modiomorphidae, Hippopodidae, and Anomalodesmata, which they resemble in different morphological features. However, careful inspection of key characters suggests that none of them are closely allied to this new genus, and placement in the Modiomorphidae is only tentative until more material is found and further characters, such as shell microstructure, can be properly analyzed. Likewise, an accurate reconstruction of this bivalve's life habit is presently impossible to determine with the two available specimens, but an endobyssate mode is probable, as has been inferred for Myoconcha.

T1  - Application of the fuzzy performance measures to the City of London water supply system
AN  - 213366481
AB  - Most engineering systems are subject to a wide range of possible uncertain future conditions. The probabilistic reliability analysis usually fails to address the problems of human error, subjectivity, and lack of system performance history and records. This paper explores the utility of the following fuzzy performance measures for evaluating the performance of a complex water supply system: (i) combined reliability-vulnerability, (ii) robustness, and (iii) resiliency. The regional water supply system for the City of London, Ontario, Canada, is used as the case study. The computational requirements for the implementation of the fuzzy performance measures and their sensitivity to different shapes of fuzzy membership functions are investigated. The study illustrates the capability of the fuzzy performance measures to handle uncertainty and identify critical system components. This can be of value in identifying the optimal level of improvement that will increase the overall system performance. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The effect of cadmium on antioxidant responses and the susceptibility to oxidative stress in the hydrothermal vent mussel Bathymodiolus azoricus
AN  - 208065594
AB  - Hydrothermal vents are a unique environment of extreme physical-chemical characteristics and biological species composition. Cd is a toxic non-essential metal present in high concentrations in the hydrothermal vent environment, contrary to those found in marine coastal areas. Cd toxicity has been related, among other things, with reactive oxygen species production, even though this is a non-redox metal. Bathymodiolus azoricus is a deep-sea Mytilid bivalve very common in the Mid Atlantic Ridge (MAR) hydrothermal vent fields and very little is known about the antioxidant defence system in this specie. Because lethal Cd concentration in B. azoricus is unknown, the aim of this study was to assess the effects of a Cd concentration higher than that found in the hydrothermal vents on oxidative stress biomarkers, such as antioxidant enzymes. Mussels were exposed to 100 microg l-1 Cd during 24, 48 and 144 h, respectively, in a pressurized aquarium (IPOCAMP). Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidases (GPx), total oxyradical scavenging capacity (TOSC), metallothionein (MT) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) were measured in the gills and mantle of B. azoricus. The results indicate that gills are first affected by Cd toxicity. This may be due to different physiological functions of the tissues and by the presence of thio and methanotrophic symbiotic bacteria in the gills. The SOD and CAT are inhibited during the first day of exposure in the gills, although TOSC and MT concentrations were the same in control and exposed mussels. In the mantle, enzymatic activation only occurred after 6 days, and no significant differences in MT concentrations were found in the control and exposed mussels during the first day, as observed in the gills.

T1  - Lake and Reservoir Management
AN  - 1267597414
AB  - A review of literature published in 2005 on the subject of lake and reservoir management is presented. Three journals were exclusively attributed to lake and reservoir management, namely, Lake and Reservoir Management published by the North American Lake Management Society (NALMS), Lakes and Reservoirs; Research and Management, an official journal of the International Lake Environment Committee (ILEC) and Journal Great Lakes Research published by the International Association of Great Lakes Research. In this review, an attempt is made to cover, as much as possible, all topics directly related to the management of lakes and reservoirs. Papers of pure scientific nature on microbial isolation, enumeration, characterization, and population dynamics are not included. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Potential Impact of Dare County Landfills on Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge
AN  - 210707212
AB  - Runoff of leachate from East Lake and Dare County Construction and Demolition Debris landfills has the potential to impact wildlife resources at Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge, Dare and Hyde Counties, North Carolina. Sediment quality of samples collected in August 2000 at 14 locations down-gradient from the landfills was assessed by measuring metal and organic contaminants in the sediments, chronic toxicity of solid-phase sediment (28-d static-renewal exposures; survival and growth as test endpoints) and acute toxicity of sediment porewater (96-h static exposures) to Hyalella azteca (Crustacea: Amphipoda). In addition, contaminant bioaccumulation from 4 sediments was determined using 28-d exposures of Lumbriculus variegatus (freshwater oligochaete). Although survival was not impaired, length of H. azteca was significantly reduced in sediments from 5 locations. Pore water from 4 locations was acutely toxic to H. azteca. Metals and a few polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were bioaccumulated by L. variegatus from the sediments. Several metals and PAHs exceeded sediment quality guidelines, and metals in porewater from several sites exceeded water quality criteria for the protection of aquatic wildlife. Runoff of leachate from the landfills has reduced sediment quality and has the potential to adversely affect wildlife resources at Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Single-step nested multiplex PCR to differentiate between various bivalve larvae
AN  - 208069459
AB  - A nested multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay has been developed that allows the discrimination between six bivalve larvae common to Danish coastal waters (Cerastoderma edule, Macoma balthica, Mytilus edulis, Spisula subtruncata, Ensis americanus and members of the order Myoida). This assay involves the simultaneous use of a pair of general universally targeted 18S rRNA gene primers, five specific 18S rRNA gene targeted oligonucleotide primers internal (nested) to the universal primer pair and one species-specific primer that is not nested (Mya). The specificity of each primer was evaluated in silico, empirically, and verified further by sequencing of amplification products from single larvae collected from plankton samples. Identification of individually isolated bivalve larvae from plankton samples was based on the size of the PCR product produced by the specific primers after visualisation by agarose gel electrophoresis. Preliminary studies indicated that this method was suitable for use with freshly collected and preserved larvae, and is therefore suitable for field application. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Accumulation of the precious metals platinum, palladium and rhodium from automobile catalytic converters in Paratenuisentis ambiguus as compared with its fish host, Anguilla anguilla
AN  - 213505344; 15831118
AB  - Abstract

              
The platinum group metals (PGM) Pt, Pd and Rh are emitted into the environment mainly by catalytic exhaust gas converters of cars. As PGM accumulate in sediments of aquatic ecosystems, the study was focused on the uptake of the noble metals by European eels, Anguilla anguilla infected with the acanthocephalan Paratenuisentis ambiguus. Eels were exposed to ground catalytic converter material for six weeks. After exposure Pt and Pd were detected in the liver and kidney of the eels and in the parasites. Palladium was also found in fish muscle and intestine. No Rh uptake by the eel tissues and the parasites occurred. Paratenuisentis ambiguus contained the highest levels of both metals with 40 times higher Pt concentrations and four times higher Pd concentrations than the liver of its host. Due to its accumulation capacity for PGM, P. ambiguus can be applied as a sensitive accumulation indicator in field studies to assess the degree of environmental PGM contamination in aquatic ecosystems.

T1  - Lake Erie ecosystem change: Phytoplankton communities
AN  - 17324898; 6248342
AB  - The biological, chemical, and physical factors that govern large lake phytoplankton abundance and dynamics are complicated by the socioeconomic demands of humans in the watershed. Lake Erie exemplifies a large lake where human-influenced land use changes and perturbations in the watershed directly affect lake function. The degradation of the Laurentian Great Lakes in the 1960's, as evidenced by phytoplankton blooms in Lake Erie among other problems, caused a public outcry that led to the passage of the binational Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement of 1978. By the mid-1980's, reduction of excess nutrient load decreased phytoplankton community biomass 68% from 1970 values. With the invasion of exotic dreissenid mussels, phytoplankton community biomass was expected to decrease even further due to the mussels' high filtering capacity (up to one liter per individual per day). We used a multi-agency (The Ohio State University; Division of Wildlife, Ohio Dept. of Natural Resources; National Water Research Institute, Environment Canada) supported study of Lake Erie plankton abundance from 1996 through 2003 to examine recent changes in the lake-wide phytoplankton community biomass and found that total phytoplankton biomass has increased over 100% from the lows of the mid-1980's. Potentially toxic cyanobacteria biomass has increased even more (>500%), whereas other taxa more edible to zooplankton (Chlorophyta, Cryptophyta) have increased by 60 to 250%. We conclude that Lake Erie is becoming more eutrophic even though management strategies continue to limit nutrient loading to levels found in the 1980's. We propose three hypotheses for recent changes: (1) unmonitored nutrients are entering the lake; (2) dreissenid mussels' excretion modified within-lake nutrient cycling; and/or (3) tributary phytoplankton populations significantly contribute to lake-wide phytoplankton blooms.

AB  - Total bacterial counts in lake water samples showed a good correlation with lake trophic status while other methods of measuring bacterioplankton abundance and activity (viable count-cell elongation assay, culturability measurements, tetrazolium salt reduction assay and esterase activity) were strongly affected by bacterioplankton size (Porter et al., 2004).  In other research, an automated image analysis method was developed to monitor Gram-positive filamentous bacteria in sludge (Pandolfi and Pons, 2004), and a quantitative competitive PCR technique was developed to detect and quantify copper-denitrifying bacteria in sediment samples (Qiu et al., 2004).  The phylogeny of genus Nitella subgenus Tieffallenia was analyzed using nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacers (ITS) and 5.8S ribosomal RNA and was compared to a phylogeny based on chloroplast genes (beta subunit of ATP synthase atpB and the large subunit of Rubisco rbcL).\n, 2004.

AB  - The tool was provided within the publication on a CD and was conceived by the panel (comprised of university professors of toxicology and risk assessment) to provide an educational resource for students interested in conducting human health and ecological risk assessments.  The Human and Environmental Risk Assessment (HERA) Project, a European partnership, has prepared human health and environmental risk assessments for ingredients of household cleaning products as part of a continuing effort (HERA, 2004).\n Human intraspecies uncertainty factors also were evaluated through an examination of the 14 chemicals in the U. S. EPA's IRIS database where benchmark doses for carcinogens were based on human studies (Abernathy et al., 2004).

T1  - How to assess toxin ingestion and post-ingestion partitioning in zooplankton?
AN  - 220276586
AB  - Algal toxins can have severe impacts on marine and aquatic ecosystems and often bioaccumulate through the food chain. One of the major obstacles facing research in this area is the lack of standardized and realistic techniques with which to probe algal-grazer interactions. Here we present a synopsis on current and innovative techniques which can be used to monitor the ambient concentration and fate of algal toxins in grazers and determine their eventual target within the grazers' tissues. We focus on a newly recognized class of oxylipin toxins (volatile polyunsaturated aldehydes and oxo-acids), which have been identified from lipid-rich microalgae. While some workers have reported that these biotoxins have negative effects on fecundity and recruitment of metazoan grazers, this mechanism is currently under debate as a result of conflicting evidence. We argue that the use of a variety of non-standard and often invalid or unrealistic assays has confounded our ability to scrutinize this mechanism systematically.

T1  - Combined chemical analyses and biomonitoring at Avedoere wastewater treatment plant in 2002
AN  - 1943439011
AB  - Influent - effluent monitoring by comprehensive chemical analyses was conducted at the Avedoere wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) during 2002. In one programme, the same samples were tested for algal toxicity by the ISO 8692 method. Based on evaluation of 17 hazardous substances (including 7 heavy metals), there was a quite good agreement between calculated and measured toxic units. In another programme, influent - effluent monitoring for 11 pharmaceuticals and specific hormones showed high removal rates, except for sulphamethizol and furosemide. High removal is probably due to WWTP operation with long SRTs. Effluent biomonitoring of freshwater mussels showed only bioaccumulation for: diethyl-phthalate, LAS, EOX as well as Cr and Ni. Surprisingly, no bioaccumulation could be observed for 100 other specific organic compounds and 8 other heavy metals (including Hg, Cd and Pb).

T1  - Short-term feeding response of the scallop Argopecten purpuratus exposed to two different diets
AN  - 224153395
AB  - Argopecten purpuratus was exposed to two different diets which reflected short term variations in quantity and quality of the natural food supply typical in bays of southern Chile. No significant differences of clearance rate were observed over different time periods at either of two food concentrations. The scallop reduced its clearance rate significantly when it was exposed to the higher food concentration. Pseudofaeces production occurred only at this high diet and the time factor had no significant effect on this process. The organic content of pseudofaeces was significantly lower than the organic content of the food, suggesting a pre-ingestive selection mechanism. Based on this capacity for particle selection, A. purpuratus was able to compensate for the differences in food quality of the experimental diets and ingesting particulate material containing 38% organic matter as a result of the selection process when fed at the higher food concentration. Absorption efficiency was lower following exposure to the high food concentration, suggesting that the experimental time of 72 h was not sufficient to acclimate the digestive response to a food supply significantly different from that of its habitat of origin. Phytoplankton form the principal nutritional source for this epibenthic species, and resuspended detritus, although occurring in large quantities, may only be of importance once digestive processes become acclimated to processing them.

T1  - Removal of geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol by biological filtration
AN  - 1943410426
AB  - The quality of drinking water is sometimes diminished by the presence of certain compounds that can impart particular tastes or odours. One of the most common and problematic types of taste and odour is the earthy/musty odour produced by geosmin (trans-1, 10-dimethyl-trans-9-decalol) and MIB (2-methylisoborneol). Taste and odour treatment processes including powdered activated carbon, and oxidation using chlorine, chloramines, potassium permanganate, and sometimes even ozone are largely ineffective for reducing these compounds to below their odour threshold concentration levels. Ozonation followed by biological filtration, however, has the potential to provide effective treatment. Ozone provides partial removal of geosmin and MIB but also creates other compounds more amenable to biodegradation and potentially undesirable biological instability. Subsequent biofiltration can remove residual geosmin and MIB in addition to removing these other biodegradable compounds. Bench scale experiments were conducted using two parallel filter columns containing fresh and exhausted granular activated carbon (GAC) media and sand. Source water consisted of dechlorinated tap water to which geosmin and MIB were added, as well as, a cocktail of easily biodegradable organic matter (i.e. typical ozonation by-products) in order to simulate water that had been subjected to ozonation prior to filtration. Using fresh GAC, total removals of geosmin ranged from 76 to 100% and total MIB removals ranged from 47% to 100%. The exhausted GAC initially removed less geosmin and MIB but removals increased over time. Overall the results of these experiments are encouraging for the use of biofiltration following ozonation as a means of geosmin and MIB removal. These results provide important information with respect to the role biofilters play during their startup phase in the reduction of these particular compounds. In addition, the results demonstrate the potential biofilters have in responding to transient geosmin and MIB episodes.

T1  - Effects of suspended and sedimented clays on juvenile hard clams, Mercenaria mercenaria, within the context of harmful algal bloom mitigation
AN  - 208071469
AB  - Increased interest in using ecologically inert clays to flocculate, sediment, and thus mitigate harmful algal blooms at nearshore mariculture sites has prompted studies on the effectiveness of this method on prolific blooms, such as those caused by the neurotoxic dinoflagellate Karenia brevis in the Gulf of Mexico. Potential repercussions of this control strategy revolve around the increased flux of suspended particles to the benthos. Juvenile suspension-feeding bivalves are potentially vulnerable as they could suffer burial, a decrease in clearance rates, and/or an increase in pseudofeces production in response to suspended clay, leading to reduced growth and delay in attaining size refuge from predators. Here we assess lethal and sublethal effects on juvenile hard clams, Mercenaria mercenaria, in a 2-week flume application of phosphatic clay to simulated blooms of the nontoxic dinoflagellates Heterocapsa triquetra and Prorocentrum micans. Flow regimes simulated two contrasting, worst-case field conditions where (1) low flow allowed complete sedimentation and formation of a benthic sediment layer, and (2) high flow allowed complete particle suspension. No clam mortalities occurred in either treatment. The sedimentation treatment showed variable growth inhibition in shell and/or tissue, but effects were not apparent compared to controls (no sediment layer), and clams rapidly resumed siphon contact with the overlying water column. In contrast, a strong growth effect (~90% reduction in shell and tissue growth) occurred in particle-suspension trials compared to no-clay controls. These results suggest that repeated clay applications in the field are likely more detrimental to clams in a high-energy environment leading to prolonged in situ resuspension of clay than in an environment favoring sedimentation.

T1  - Evaluation of the Economic Impact of Proposed Non-Indigenous Species Control Measures for the St Lawrence Seaway Using Multi-Attribute Decision Theory
AN  - 194604913
AB  - Mandatory ballast water management, resulting in an increase of required freight rates (RFR) on the St Lawrence Seaway, may cause modal shifts from the marine transportation mode to other modes. However, the modal shifts could well produce several undesirable side effects, such as worse air pollution, lower transportation safety, etc. To evaluate the trade-off between these and the positive ballast water management effects, a multi-attribute decision problem is formulated and solved, using the Analytic Hierarchy Process method, fuzzy set theory, and utility theory. A numerical example is presented. The results indicate that such modal shifts should be avoided, since the more the cargo is shifted from the marine mode to other modes, the more unfavourable the consequences are for the system.

T1  - Analysis of population genetic structure of the green sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis) using microsatellites
AN  - 208073718
AB  - We measured within- and among-population genetic variation in the green sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis) at 11 sites in the north Atlantic and northeast Pacific by using four-locus microsatellite genotypes. We found no differentiation among populations from Atlantic Canada, but strong differentiation across the north Atlantic and between the Atlantic and Pacific samples. High inbreeding coefficients at three loci are consistent with high variance in reproductive success. One population that was recently decimated by disease was strongly differentiated from some others, but there was little differentiation otherwise among populations in Atlantic Canada. On a larger scale, populations in Atlantic Canada were more similar to a population from the north Pacific than to populations in the northwest Atlantic. Differentiation among populations at this large spatial scale is consistent with biogeographical hypotheses of: (1) Pleistocene population reduction and isolation in the northeast Atlantic, but (2) extinction in the northwest Atlantic followed by extensive recolonization from the Pacific. In contrast to other recent studies of trans-Atlantic organisms, we found no evidence of extensive gene flow across the north Atlantic. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The role of coarse colloids as a carrier phase for trace metals in riverine systems
AN  - 734705215
AB  - In order to better understand the role of colloids in aquatic systems, better fractionation methods of environmental samples into particulate, colloidal, and truly dissolved phase are needed. An adequate fractionation procedure involves 1) prefiltration to remove large (i.e., settling) particles and 2) ultrafiltration to separate colloids from the truly dissolved compounds. Prefiltration is most commonly accomplished using filters with 0.45 or 0.22 μm pore size, which results in the inclusion of coarse colloids (size by definition up to about 1 μm) into the particulate phase. To evaluate the possible drawbacks of such operational procedures, the trace metal fraction associated with coarse colloids (size range 0.45-1.2 μm) was quantified in a number of rivers having different biogeochemical characteristics and degree of anthropogenic impact. Al, Pb, and Ti showed a strong association with coarse colloids (often over 50% of the total filterable metal at  1.2 μm) in all rivers. Other elements (Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, U, V, and Zn) had a more variable behaviour, possibly linked to differences in conductivity, oxygen saturation, and nature of colloids (mineral, organic, or mixed) among rivers. No overall statistically significant relationships could be found between the percentage metal fractions associated with coarse colloids and master environmental variables. However, when systems where classified according to the nature of colloids, Al and Pb showed statistically significant relationships with suspended particulate matter. Significant relationships were also observed between the metal pairs Mn/Co, Mn/Cu, Mn/V, Fe/Co, and Fe/Ni. The association of trace metals with coarse colloids has important implications as to their transport, fate and bioavailability in natural systems. These findings suggest that, at least in some cases, the use of the classical size limit of 0.45 μm as a boundary between the particulate and dissolved phases should be partially reconsidered and redefined.

T1  - Seasonal variation in the feeding physiology and scope for growth of green mussels, Perna viridis in estuarine Ma Wan, Hong Kong
AN  - 224128862
AB  - Seasonal variations in feeding physiology and scope for growth of green mussels Perna viridis (Bivalvia: Mytilidae) were investigated in Ma Wan, an estuarine mariculture site located in the southern waters of Hong Kong. Total particulate matter, particulate organic matter, particulate inorganic matter and organic fraction of seston (f), and food availability were monitored monthly from January to December 1998. Feeding rates, including clearance rate, filtration, ingestion and absorption, and absorption efficiency were higher in summer and autumn and lower in winter. Pseudofaeces were produced but the preferential selection of organic materials by P. viridis was not concluded. Scope for growth in  July and October were higher than in February. Activities of digestive enzymes including amylase and cellulase in the digestive diverticula and crystalline style were high in May and July and lower in February and October and correlated with f. Faster growth rates obtained for P. viridis in Hong Kong's summer are considered a result of enhanced feeding and absorption at high temperatures and f values. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Physiological costs of reproduction in the Sydney rock oyster Saccostrea glomerata: How expensive is reproduction?
AN  - 734479982; 12698338
AB  - In this study, triploid Sydney rock oysters Saccostrea glomerata, which do not reproduce and have only limited gonadal development, were used to calculate the cost of producing and maintaining somatic tissues. The consumption of oxygen was measured and converted to units of energy expended. The consumption of oxygen of diploid oysters, in different stages of the reproductive cycle, was also measured. Knowing the costs of producing and maintaining somatic tissues (obtained from the triploid oysters), it was possible to calculate the energy demand of somatic and reproductive tissues of diploid oysters. The focus of this study was to test whether this method would work, to investigate if this method would give results in accordance with modern life-history theory and to test hypotheses about costs of reproduction in oysters. It was found that in diploid oysters, 27% of the consumed oxygen was needed for reproductive processes. It was also found that the costs of production and maintenance of reproductive tissues were on average 84% of those of somatic tissues. Costs for the production and maintenance of somatic tissues decreased over time. Costs for reproduction also decreased, but were dependent on the stage of gonadal development. If the relative mass of gametes in the gonads was large, the costs were relatively small; if the mass was relatively small, the costs were large. Differences between traits of males and females were never significant, suggesting that reproductive effort and costs were similar in males and females. It was estimated that if diploid oysters did not reproduce, they could gain 64% more somatic ash-free dry mass. Thus, in terms of growth, reproduction is an expensive activity.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Temperature adaptation in eurythermal cod (Gadus morhua): A comparison of mitochondrial enzyme capacities in boreal and Arctic populations
AN  - 208076405
AB  - Activities of citrate synthase (CS), cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) and the electron transport system (ETS) were investigated in white muscle and liver of laboratory-maintained cod, Gadus morhua, from the North Sea, Norwegian coast and Barents Sea for an analysis of temperature acclimation and adaptation in aerobic metabolism. Cold acclimation within each population led to elevated activities of CS, CCO and ETS in white muscle. In liver, however, only North Sea cod showed cold-compensated CS activities, with CCO and ETS unchanged. In contrast, cold-acclimated Norwegian cod displayed unchanged enzyme activities, and Arctic cod showed elevated activities for CS, but decreased activities for CCO and no change in ETS. Between-population comparisons revealed clear evidence for permanent cold adaptation in white muscle of northern (Norwegian coast and Barents Sea) compared to boreal (North Sea) cod populations, reflected by higher activities of CS, CCO and ETS at the same acclimation temperature. Cold-compensated, mass-specific enzyme activities in liver were found in northern compared to boreal cod for CS and CCO, however, for ETS, after warm acclimation only. When evaluated as capacity in total liver, such activities were only found in northern populations in the case of CS at all temperatures, and for CCO and ETS at 15 degrees C only. Hepatosomatic index (IH) and liver lipid contents were highest in North Sea cod, with similar IH but lower lipid contents in cold- versus warm-acclimated animals. An acclimation effect on IH was found in Norwegian cod only, with higher IH but unchanged lipid contents in the cold. In conclusion, permanent cold adaptation of muscle aerobic metabolism prevails in cod populations at higher latitudes, which is in line with permanently elevated rates of oxygen consumption observed in a parallel study. These differences reflect higher maintenance costs in cold-adapted versus cold-acclimated cod. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Branchial musculature of a venerid clam: Pharmacology, distribution, and innervation
AN  - 220996972
AB  - This study was meant to analyze the neural control of the branchial muscles of the clam Mercenaria mercenaria. Gills isolated from the animal contract in response to 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT), dopamine (DA), and acetylcholine (ACh); but the ACh contraction occurred only if the gills had been pretreated with the cholinesterase inhibitor eserine. The 5HT antagonists cyproheptadine and mianserin blocked the contractile effects of all of the agonists. However, gills exposed to the 5HT antagonists and eserine relaxed in response to ACh. The DA antagonist SCH-83566 inhibited the effects of DA, but had no effect on contractions induced by 5HT and ACh. The ACh antagonist hexamethonium inhibited both the excitatory and inhibitory effects of ACh, but had no effect on contractions induced by 5HT and DA. 5HT and DA in gill tissue were visualized by immunohistochemistry. Within each gill filament are dorsoventral neurons running adjacent to the epithelium and containing immunoreactive 5HT and DA. A complex network of of 5HT-positive fibers is associated with the septa, blood vessels, and muscles, whereas DA-positive fibers are restricted to the septa. We propose that 5HT is the excitatory transmitter to the gill muscles, and that DA and ACh exert their excitatory effects by stimulating 5HT motor nerves. ACh may also be an inhibitory transmitter of the muscles.

T1  - ANALYSIS OF A NUCLEAR-DNA MARKER FOR SPECIES IDENTIFICATION OF ADULTS AND LARVAE IN THE MYTILUS EDULIS COMPLEX
AN  - 195533825
AB  - The advent of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based DNA markers, which claim to identify species diagnostically in the Mytilus edulis complex (M. edulis, M. galloprovincialis and M. trossulus) presents a possible method for simple, rapid species identification of Mytilus larvae. This study examines the inheritance of the Me 15/16 nuclear-DNA locus, which has previously been shown to produce three alleles diagnostic for M. edulis, M. galloprovincialis and M. trossulus. The Me 15/16 genotype was determined for pure species and hybrid larvae from 13 laboratory crosses between these three species and for adult mussels from five natural populations from which the parents of the crosses were selected. Genotype frequencies in the parent populations were generally as expected for M. edulis and M. galloprovincialis, but M. trossulus populations from eastern Canada and the Baltic Sea gave unexpected results. The marker was readily detected in individual larvae sampled 72 h and 2 weeks after fertilization, but amplification from 3 h old larvae was less reliable. Each cross produced larvae of all the expected genotypes and the results demonstrate that each of the three alleles can be inherited from either sex. The marker appears to be inherited in a Mendelian manner and should be of potential use in the future study of larvae in the M. edulis complex.

T1  - Ontogenetic changes in gill morphology and potential significance for food acquisition in the scallop Placopecten magellanicus
AN  - 208069650
AB  - Sources of mortality in both wild and cultured populations of marine bivalves during postlarval stages remain largely unknown, but may be partly associated with the inability to meet energetic demands during intense morphogenesis. The development of the gills in postsettlement scallops (Placopecten magellanicus) from 0.35 to 14 mm in shell height (SH) was investigated using scanning electron microscopy to determine the degree of size-specific differentiation of the gills and evaluate potential ontogenetic constraints in food acquisition. Key transitional stages in morphogenesis, likely to exert pronounced effects on feeding function, were identified and correlated with scallop size. The gill was initially homorhabdic, with unreflected inner demibranchs forming a basket-like structure maintained by ciliary junctions. Gill reflection, immediately followed by accelerated proliferation of gill filaments and formation of outer demibranchs, occurred at ~1 mm SH. Outer demibranchs were fully formed at ~2 mm SH. Suspension-feeding is probably rather inefficient prior to attaining 1-2 mm sizes. The onset of the heterorhabdic, adult form of the gill, which allows bidirectional particle transport and the potential for selection and for volume regulation of ingested material on the gill, occurred fairly late in development, at ~3.3-5.0 mm SH. Full development of gill plication was delayed until scallops attained ~7 mm. Gill differentiation in this species is thus relatively protracted and punctuated by critical transitional stages, which may be important in determining feeding and growth capacity of postlarval wild and cultured populations.

T1  - Long-term stability in the richness and structure of helminth communities in eels, Anguilla anguilla, in Lough Derg, River Shannon, Ireland
AN  - 213493810; 12498636
AB  - Abstract

              
A data set on intestinal helminth parasites was collected in the course of an 18 year investigation into the biology of eels in Meelick Bay, Lough Derg, River Shannon. This was used to test two hypotheses relating to the composition and structure of intestinal helminth communities, namely that eels in large rivers do not harbour richer and more diverse communities than those in small rivers but that community composition and structure are more stable over time than in small rivers. The helminth community was species poor, with only six species comprising the component community and a maximum infracommunity richness of three species. The community was overwhelmingly dominated by the acanthocephalan Acanthocephalus lucii, reflecting the importance of its intermediate host Asellus aquaticus in the eels' diet. The remaining helminth species contributed to species richness but made very little contribution to community diversity. Population levels of Acanthocephalus lucii fell and remained low between 1992 and 2000, probably reflecting increased movement of eels from other parts of the lough into Meelick Bay. Diversity values were low, but similar to those reported from other rivers in Britain and Europe. The results provided support for both hypotheses and indicated that in respect of richness, diversity and dominance, the helminth communities of eels in the River Shannon were typical of, and comparable to, those of other large rivers throughout Europe.

Here, we investigated the effects of nutrients (N and P) and planktivorous fish (Phoxinus sp.) on the partitioning of photosynthetically fixed ^sup 14^C-labelled bicarbonate into macromolecules (lipids, polysaccharides and proteins) and low molecular weight (LMW) metabolites of epilimnetic phytoplankton living in large (8 m diameter) enclosures from July to mid-October 1991. The enclosures were situated in an oligotrophic lake (north of Montreal, Canada) in both shallow (3.5 m) and deep (11 m) locations. The fractions were calculated using the sequential extraction of ^sup 14^C-labeled phytoplankton samples incubated for short duration (2 hours) at maximum photosynthetic rates. Labelling patterns of all end products exhibited great temporal variations. Overall, the LMW, polysaccharide, lipid and protein fractions accounted for 32.1 ± 10.5%, 31.0 ± 8.8%, 19.2 ± 5.3% and 17.8 ± 6.1% of the total ^sup 14^C fixed respectively. Percent ^sup 14^C in the LMW fraction was, in general, lower in the nutrient-enriched enclosure and was usually lower in the deep than the shallow enclosures. The effect of fish on the labelling pattern of LMW varied throughout the sampling period but, overall, its impact was non-significant. The proportions of ^sup 14^C into lipids and polysaccharides did not show the expected increase under nutrient deficiency. In contrast, the polysaccharide fraction increased, for the most part, with nutrient enrichment and was higher in the deep than the shallow enclosures with little changes in the presence of planktivorous fish. Incorporation of ^sup 14^C into lipids remained relatively uniform throughout the study and averaged less than 20% of total fixed carbon. Nutrient addition increased the lipid fraction in early July but did not have a significant effect thereafter. In general, the presence of planktivorous fish decreased the lipid fraction especially in the deep N + F enclosures. With nutrient enrichment, the proportion of ^sup 14^C incorporated into protein decreased in the shallow enclosures while it increased in the deep enclosures. During most of the study, there was no significant effect of fish on the distribution pattern of protein. Percent carbon protein averaged 20% of total carbon fixed during the summer and decreased to 10% in October with lower water temperatures. Any fish effects encountered throughout this study were probably mediated indirectly through changes in the species and cell size compositions of phytoplankton. An experiment where samples were incubated with depth (0.5 to 7 m) showed that, for all treatments, the protein fraction increased with depth at the expense of lipid and LMW metabolites syntheses. The polysaccharide fraction demonstrated no apparent relationships with depth. These changes with depth most likely reflect light attenuation rather than a decrease in temperature. Overall, our findings would suggest that the distribution patterns of photosynthetically incorporated carbon into LMW compounds and macromolecules in natural phytoplankton communities are controlled by a combination of both abiotic (e.g., nutrients, light and temperature) and biotic (species and cell size) environmental factors and the interactions between these factors will in essence influence the direction of carbon flow and the food quality of the phytoplankton. These observations are placed in context with a review of the literature on carbon allocation by natural populations of phytoplankton. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - OOCYTE DEGENERATION AND ALTERED OVIPOSITORY ACTIVITY INDUCED BY PARAQUAT IN THE FRESHWATER SNAIL PHYSA FONTINALIS (GASTROPODA: PULMONATA)
AN  - 195521126
AB  - The freshwater snail Physa fontinalis was used as a bioindicator to study the effects of the herbicide Paraquat (PQ) in laboratory assays. The test solutions used, 0.125, 0.25, and 0.5 mg/l PQ, were in the range of the concentrations recommended for aquatic weed control. The study was carried out in two stages to determine the influence of PQ on the ovipository activity of Physa fontinalis, and the histological effects on these snails. Specimens exposed to PQ continued to be reproductively active, but the number of egg masses and eggs laid decreased significantly. Mortality was almost the same in all the experimental lots, but was significantly related to the production of egg masses only in the controls. The histological analysis showed a clear trend among PQ concentrations and degenerating oocytes, but no visible effects on the male sex-line were observed. By interfering with fertility, PQ has an action that may go well beyond its lethal effect on individuals, suggesting that this herbicide should be strictly regulated in weed control programmes. Moreover, since PQ was observed to interfere with the reproductive process, its endocrine disrupting action must not be excluded.

T1  - Mechanistic studies on baseline toxicity and uncoupling of organic compounds as a basis for modeling effective membrane concentrations in aquatic organisms
AN  - 917591088
AB  - Mechanistic studies on membrane toxicity are reviewed and linked to effects observed in-vivo. Time-resolved spectroscopy on energy-transducing membranes is an in-vitro test method that provides information on the toxicodynamics of membrane toxicity, namely baseline toxicity and uncoupling. Without blurring effects of the toxicokinetic phase, the intrinsic potency of membrane toxicants can directly be determined thus allowing the development of a classification system to distinguish between baseline toxicity and uncoupling. Toxicity data of known baseline toxicants and of substituted phenols from literature are reevaluated in light of the information obtained from the mechanistic test system. Exposure-based effect data (aqueous effect concentrations) of substituted phenols (baseline toxicants and uncouplers) from various aquatic organisms (bacteria, protozoa, algae, daphnids, fish) are compared to the corresponding effect concentrations expected from baseline toxicity. The results of the comparison support the view that the membrane is the primary target site for acute toxicity of substituted phenols in aquatic organisms. The classification into baseline toxicants and uncouplers based upon the criteria derived from the mechanistic test system is correct. Nevertheless, the acute toxicity in-vivo cannot be correlated quantitatively to the mechanistic data presumably because bioaccumulation is not directly proportional to intrinsic toxicity and the metabolic transformation is variable within the test set of substituted phenols. The pH-dependence of acute toxicity is mainly determined by the pH-dependence of bioccumulation, the internal effect concentrations are virtually independent on external pH. The internal effect concentrations, also called lethal body burdens or critical body residues, which are taken from the literature or calculated from aqueous effect concentrations and bioconcentration factors, are related to membrane concentrations using a simple three-compartment equilibrium partitioning model. The modeled membrane concentrations of non-polar and polar narcotics turn out to be statistically indistinguishable, which is consistent with the findings from the mechanistic test system. The toxic ratios, i.e., the excess toxicity of uncouplers in relation to their baseline toxicity, agree for most compounds upon comparison of the mechanistic test system with the aquatic organisms thus confirming that uncoupling is the dominant mode of action responsible for lethality.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The effectiveness of some compounds derived from antifouling paints in promoting imposex in Nassarius reticulatus
AN  - 224129119
AB  - Adult Nassarius reticulatus were exposed for two to three months to dissolved tributyltin (TBT), dibutyltin (DBT), triphenyltin (TPT) and diphenyltin (DPT) chlorides and to copper sulphate (CuSO4) in order to study the effectiveness of these compounds to induce imposex (penis and vas deferens development). The dialkyltins and copper did not promote imposex under exposure to 500 ng Sn l-1 and 500 ng Cu l-1. However, dissolved nominal concentrations varying between 100 and 500 ng Sn l-1 of TBT or TPT induced imposex in, respectively, 22 to 43% and 24 to 44% of the females. The testosterone titres of females increased significantly after two months' exposure to 250 ng Sn l-1 of TPT and TBT and the same happened to males exposed to 100 and 250 ng TPT-Sn l-1 and to 250 ng TBT-Sn l-1.

T1  - The monetary benefits of nutrient abatement in the Rhine basin for the water treatment plant of WRK at Andijk
AN  - 1943099179
AB  - Excessive nutrient loads in rivers and lakes have adverse effects on ecosystem functioning and human activities. The International Rhine Committee has tried to reverse this trend by formulating emission reduction objectives. One of the human activities that may benefit from this is water production that uses surface water as its main source. This paper explores whether reductions in nutrient loads in the Rhine basin result in changes in (the intensity of) treatment activities by the water treatment plant of the Water-transport-company Rhine-Kennemerland (WRK) at Andijk, the Netherlands. For this purpose, a regression analysis was performed on data from 1990-1995 to find a quantitative relationship between the water quality objective for the end product on the one hand, and water quality parameters in Lake IJssel and various treatment processes on the other hand. 
In the years 1985-1995, phosphorus loads to Lake IJssel reduced by 50% as a result of significant abatement efforts in the Rhine river basin. As a result, chlorophyll-a concentrations decreased by less than 10%. Further phosphorus emission reductions in the Rhine river basin, for example 75% by the year 2000 as is the objective in the Rhine Action Programme, are expected to result in a 30% decrease in chlorophyll-a concentrations compared with the levels of 1985. These reductions in chlorophyll-a concentrations can be expected to have some impacts on the water treatment plant of WRK at Andijk. However, as they constitute less than 1% of production costs, the monetary benefits of these reductions are limited.

T1  - Fertilization success and the effects of sperm chrmoattractants on effective egg size in marine invertebrates
AN  - 208074320
AB  - The effects of sperm chemoattractants released from eggs of the solitary ascidian Ciona intestinalis were estimated using a molecular-diffusion model. The diffusion coefficient of the chemoattractant was estimated to be between 0.933X10-5 cm2 s-1 and 0.124x10-5 cm2 s-1; the release rate of the chemoattractant from the egg was estimated at 10.6 pg s-1, and the chemoattractant threshold concentration required to elicit sperm motility was estimated at between 91.3 mg ml-1 and 9.31 mg ml-1.

AB  - During 2-12 August 1999, the development of a surface bloom dominated by the cyanobacterium Nodularia spumigena was followed in the western Gulf of Finland, Baltic Sea. Intense surface scums of aggregated N. spumigena existed on calm days. Empty N. spumigena cells and trace amounts of cell-bound nodularin were found in surficial sediment, indicating that toxin-producing N. spumigena had reached the seafloor.

T1  - Separating wastewater systems is key in protecting source waters
AN  - 221579309
AB  - The Ogouchi Dam and its reservoir are located on the upper reaches of the Tama River. Because Ogouchi Dam's catchment area is preserved as a source water protection forest, the reservoir's water is very clean. Reports indicate that the BOD concentration at the intake for the water treatment plant closest to Ogouchi Dam is around 1 mg/L (BWTMG, 1995). However, Tokyo also takes its raw water from downstream sections of the Tama river, and thus it has a management approach that is similar to that of Osaka.

AB  - To determine how fertilisation varied with sperm concentration for two species of scallop, Chlamys (Equichlamys) bifrons (Lamarck) and C. asperrima (Lamarck), we performed a simple series of sperm dilution experiments, and measured egg size and sperm swimming speeds. C. bifrons eggs were much larger (average diam = 116.5 mum), and sperm swimming speeds faster (209.8 mum s-1), than C. asperrima (71.2 mum, 166.0 mum s-1).

T1  - Joint Toxicity of Copper and Zinc to a Terrestrial Nematode Community in an Acid Sandy Soil
AN  - 214672111
AB  - Heavy metal toxicity to an indigenous nematode community was examined following the addition of Cu and Zn, alone or in combination, to agricultural soil. The dissolved Cu or Zn concentrations measured after equilibrating soil samples with a 0.01 M solution of CaCl<2< showed that the metal concentrations found in soils with combined metal additions were not significantly different from those with single metal additions. After an exposure period of six months, many nematode community parameters and individual nematode taxa were significantly affected by increasing concentrations of Cu and Zn up to 200 mg kg<-1<. Some nematode taxa, such as <Thonus<, <Alaimus< and <Aporcelaimellus< were very sensitive and disappeared at Cu and Zn concentrations exceeding 50 mg kg<-1<. For several nematode community parameters and nematode taxa, EC<50< values for single metal exposures were used to calculate TU<50< values for the joint toxicity of Cu and Zn. Based on these calculations, it is concluded that the effects of a combined exposure to Cu and Zn were additive or less than additive. Before this conclusion can be generalised, however, more data are needed on other types of soil, other pH values and other combinations of pollutants.

T1  - Zooplankton bacterivory at coastal and offshore sites of Lake Erie
AN  - 220265423
AB  - Two size classes of zooplankton (microzooplankton: 40-200 [mu]m; rotifers and nauplii, but protists were excluded; and macrozooplankton: >200 [mu]m; cladocerans and copepods) bacterivory at coastal and offshore sites in Lake Erie, USA, were determined in situ using both fluorescent and radiolabeled bacteria during the summers of 1993 and 1994. Bacterial abundance cellular carbon content and productivity were significantly higher at the more eutrophic coastal site (P <0.01). Bacterivorous rotifers usually dominated total rotiferan abundance at both sites. All cladocerans except Leptodora kindtii grazed bacteria, but most copepods did not. Microzooplankton (especially rotifers) were generally more important bacterial grazers than macroplankton (primarily cladocerans) at both sites, and accounted for 56 and 71% of total zooplankton bacterivory at the coastal and offshore sites, respectively. However, on four occasions (out of 16 cases) when cladoceran biomass was >60% of total zooplankton biomass, macrozooplankton bacterivory accounted for 54-95% of total bacterivory. Total zooplankton generally consumed <50% of bacterial productivity at the coastal site, while zooplankton bacterivory often exceeded bacterial productivity at the offshore site. Zooplankton consumed an average of 27 and 114% daily bacterial standing stock at the coastal and offshore site respectively. Considering the total community bacterivory zooplankton were often more important bacterial predators than protists. Our results demonstrate the importance of bacteria as a carbon source for zooplankton in the Lake Erie food web, where rotifers can contribute significantly to total zooplankton bacterivory.

T1  - Results of an International Plankton Investigation on the River Rhine
AN  - 1943295197
AB  - Quantitative plankton observations have been carried out in the River Rhine from Lake Constance to the North Sea as part of an ecological monitoring programme, initiated to provide a baseline for evaluating measures taken under the “Rhine Action Programme”. The phyto- and Zooplankton monitoring, carried out in 1990 is the first concerted programme covering the 1000 km long reach of the river below Lake Constance. Seasonal observations at 20 fixed stations along the river were carried out by different institutes; this required calibration of methods. In the upper Rhine the sparse population of phyto-plankton (< 5 µg chlorophyll-a l-1) was dominated by various groups of algae, i.e. Cryptop-hyceae, Bacillariophyceae, Chlorophyceae and Cyanophyceae. Downstream, the phyto-plankton density increased gradually, while Bacillariophyceae tended to dominate. The high densities found in the lower R. Rhine represented only a few species of centric Bacillariophyceae and Chlorophyceae. The dense blooms of phytoplankton in the lower R. Rhine are triggered by the input of phytoplankton from the upper reaches and tributaries, and are stimulated by large inputs of nutrients. These blooms are accompanied by blooms of Zooplankton, especially rotifers, Dreissena polymorpha larvae and, in the lower Rhine, nauplii larvae. The species composition and biomass of plankton in the R. Rhine vary strongly during the year but also between years, as indicated for the period 1980-1990. However, the information at the species level needs further elaboration to allow interpretation of long-term trends. Notably, the input by tributaries should be included. To assess these long-term trends we recommend supplementing the large-scale biological inventory, as planned for the years 1995 and 2000, with plankton observations in the years between and investigating the relationship between the benthic and pelagic communities of the river.
