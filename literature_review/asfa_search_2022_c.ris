T1  - Heavy metal content and health risk assessment of a South-eastern Nigeria River
AN  - 2439647360
AB  - An enormous deficiency lag exists in the demand and supply of potable water in Umuahia, Abia State, Nigeria. The people have to pay lots of money to get potable water from water vendors, and those who cannot afford to pay patronize other unwholesome sources. Ossah River, one of the local drinking water sources, was studied to assess the heavy metal content and health risk assessment vis-a-vis its suitability for human consumption. Eight (8) heavy metals (Mn, Cu, Pb, Fe, Zn, Cd, Cr and Ni) were assessed between January and June 2018 in 3 stations, using atomic absorption spectrometer, and compared with Nigerian drinking water standards. Some of the heavy metals evaluated exceeded standards and warranted health risk assessment. Health risk assessment for all the stations indicated that there is no particularly dangerous single heavy metal, but their cumulative effect, indicated by the hazard index (HI). HI for all the stations highly exceeded threshold value (1). This calls for concern for both adults and children exposed to the water through ingestion. The heavy metal contamination observed was geogenic, exacerbated by anthropogenic activities.

T1  - Bivalve Feeding Responses to Microalgal Bloom Species in the Indian River Lagoon: the Potential for Top-Down Control
AN  - 2426355582
AB  - In 2011, the Indian River Lagoon, a biodiverse estuary in eastern Florida (USA), experienced an intense microalgal bloom with disastrous ecological consequences. The bloom included a mix of microalgae with unresolved taxonomy and lasted for 7 months with a maximum concentration of 130 μg chlorophyll a L−1. In 2012, brown tide Aureoumbra lagunensis also bloomed in portions of this estuary, with reoccurrences in 2016 and 2018. To identify and understand the role of grazer pressure (top-down control) on bloom formation, we coupled DNA sequencing with bivalve feeding assays using three microalgae isolated from the 2011 bloom and maintained in culture. Feeding experiments were conducted on widely distributed bivalve species in the lagoon, including eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica), hooked mussels (Ischadium recurvum), charru mussels (Mytella charruana), green mussels (Perna viridis), Atlantic rangia (Rangia cuneata), and hard clams (Mercenaria mercenaria), which were exposed to 3 × 104 cells mL−1 of five species of microalgae consisting of A. lagunensis and the three species clarified herein, the picocyanobacteria Crocosphaera sp. and ‘Synechococcus’ sp., and the picochlorophyte Picochlorum sp., as well as Nannochloropsis oculata used as a control. To ensure clearance rates were indicative of consumption and assimilation, the microalgae were isotopically (15N) labeled prior to feeding experiments. Clearance rates differed among bivalve and microalgal species, but enriched 15N values in bivalve tissue suggest that algal bloom species were assimilated by the bivalves. These results expand our understanding of the important ecosystem services that healthy, biodiverse filter feeder communities provide.

T1  - RNAseq Reveals Sensitive, Concentration-Dependent Transcriptional Markers of Copper in Mytilus californianus Larvae and Adults
AN  - 2438794168
AB  - Copper contamination of coastal waters is a long-standing problem in many regions. Copper water quality criteria in marine waters is often determined with bivalve embryo-larval toxicity tests which measure survival and normal development as endpoints. Gene expression data is increasingly incorporated into such assays as a complementary and sensitive marker of contaminant exposure or toxicity. Here we measured the impacts of copper on Mytilus californianus larval transcriptional profiles, and identified sensitive biomarkers of copper exposure. Key functional categories that were identified among these genes include biomineralization/shell formation, metal binding, and development. Finally, we compared the transcriptional response of larvae to that of adult gill tissue, and show in both datasets that patterns of declining transcript expression occur at lower copper concentrations than those required to induce increases in transcript expression, suggesting that down-regulated genes serve as the most sensitive marker of copper exposure.

T1  - Potential and Feasibility of Mytilus spp. Farming Along a Salinity Gradient
AN  - 2408953925
AB  - Mussel farming, compared to marine finfish aquaculture, represents an environmentally friendly alternative for a high quality protein source and can at the same time be a measure to remove excess nutrients in eutrophic areas. As such, it is considered as a promising ‘blue growth’ potential and promoted within the European Union. To expand mussel aquaculture, new regions have to be considered because there are multiple marine usages, and spatial limitations occur in coastal areas. The brackish Baltic Sea might be considered for expansion of mussel aquaculture. This study focusses on estimated production potential, economic profitability and nutrient remediation potential of mussel farming at different salinities. Four experimental mussel farms were set up along the German Baltic coast at salinities ranging from 7 to 17 psu. Collected growth data was used to calibrate and validate a Dynamic Energy Budget model and to predict the potential mussel production at twelve sites along the German coast. The estimated production and nutrient removal was used to assess economic profitability, assuming two usages of the harvest: human consumption and mussel meal production. Measured mussel specific growth rates increased with salinity from 0.05 mm d-1 in Greifswald Bay to 0.11 mm d-1 in Kiel Fjord. Within 6 months, a one-hectare farm could produce from 1 t (Darss-Zingst-Bodden-Chain) to 51 t (Flensburg) fresh mussels and remove 1.1 to 27.7 kg P and 24.7 to 612.7 kg N, respectively. Mussel farms at sites west of Rostock at salinities >10 psu could produce 5 cm mussels within 18 months, but only farms at Flensburg, Eckernförde and Kiel Fjord became profitable at a farm size of 4 ha (160,000 m³) at current market prices of 2.2 € kg-1. Regardless of the farm size, none of the farm sites could operate profitable if fresh mussels were sold for animal feeding at sales price of 0.06 € kg-1. Yearly nutrient removal costs at a small-scale farm (1 ha) ranged between 162 € (Flensburg) and 4,018 € (Darss-Zingst-Bodden-Chain) per kg nitrogen, and 3,580 € and 88,750 € per kg phosphorus, respectively.

T1  - Effect of eutrophication and humification on nutrient cycles and transfer efficiency of matter in freshwater food webs
AN  - 2404249626
AB  - We evaluated how eutrophication and humification impacted nutrient cycles and the efficiency of carbon transfer in the planktonic food webs of 12 lakes in north-eastern Poland that differed in trophic state. Our results indicated that the effectiveness of carbon transfer between phytoplankton and zooplankton varied from 0.0005% to 0.14%, which is much lower than the theoretical 10%. The highest efficiency of carbon transfer occurred in the mesotrophic lakes due to the higher hypolimnetic zooplankton production, while the lowest efficiency was observed in the dystrophic lakes and in one eutrophic lake that was dominated by cyanobacteria. Inedible algae (e.g. Gonyostomum semen) and cyanobacteria appeared to be the main factors reducing the efficiency of the transfer of matter in pelagic food webs. The results of our study showed that plankton communities are a key component of the nutrient cycle in freshwater food webs. Phytoplankton were a very effective nitrogen sink, and in the mesotrophic lakes, up to 99% of the total nitrogen was sequestrated in phytoplankton. As a result, there was a depletion of inorganic nitrogen in the upper water layer. Furthermore, zooplankton were an important phosphorus sink, thus significantly influencing the nutrient cycles.

T1  - You Are What You Eat, Microplastics in Porbeagle Sharks From the North East Atlantic: Method Development and Analysis in Spiral Valve Content and Tissue
AN  - 2398378942
AB  - Researchers worldwide are studying the environmental distribution and impacts of manufactured or environmentally fragmented small pieces of plastics, so called microplastics (<5 mm). These microplastics eventually build up in the marine environment, threatening marine ecosystems. The magnitude, fate and effects of these microplastics across the food web are largely unknown. Here, we measured digested microplastics in a top predator and critically endangered species, the North-East Atlantic Porbeagle shark (Lamna nasus), and compared this with general health conditions. A method for quantifying microplastics in spiral valves of porbeagle sharks was developed. Microplastics were detected in all spiral valves, up to 10.4 particles per g wet weight (w.w.) content and 9.5 particles per g w.w. tissue. This equates to individual microplastics loads as high as 3850 particles per spiral valve, most likely a result of trophic transfer. No statistically significant correlations were found between the average number of plastic particles in spiral valve content and tissue and the Condition and Hepatosomatic Index of porbeagle sharks. The results of this research show that North-East Atlantic porbeagle sharks ingest and digest microplastics and that there is a potential for microplastic biomonitoring using this species. More research is needed to detect possible health effects of microplastic contamination in these apex predators.

T1  - Disconnects between ecological theory and data in phenological mismatch research
AN  - 2476739551
AB  - Climate change may lead to phenological mismatches, where the timing of critical events between interacting species becomes desynchronized, with potential negative consequences. Evidence documenting negative impacts on fitness is mixed. The Cushing match-mismatch hypothesis, the most common hypothesis underlying these studies, offers testable assumptions and predictions to determine consequences of phenological mismatch when combined with a pre-climate change baseline. Here, we highlight how improved approaches could rapidly advance mechanistic understanding. We find that, to the best of our knowledge, no study has yet collected the data required to test this hypothesis well, and 71% of studies fail to define a baseline. Experiments that clearly link timing to fitness and test extremes, integration across approaches and null models would aid robust predictions of shifts with climate change.Phenological shifts due to climate change can desynchronize the timings of life history events between species, but predicting the consequences is challenging. Changes to current methodologies would allow testing of the widely used Cushing hypothesis and improve predictions of climate change impacts.

T1  - A Synoptic Climatological Analysis of the Atmospheric Drivers of Water Clarity Variability in the Great Lakes
AN  - 2407765495
AB  - A historical water clarity index (Kd index or KDI) was developed through the use of satellite-derived and validated diffuse light attenuation (Kd; m−1) for each of the Great Lakes (and subbasins) on a daily level from 1998 to 2015. A statistical regionalization was performed with monthly level KDI using k-means clustering to subdivide the Great Lakes into regions with similar temporal variability in water clarity. The KDI was then used to assess the relationship between water clarity and atmospheric circulation patterns and stream discharge. An artificial neural-network-based self-organized map data reduction technique was used to classify atmospheric patterns using four atmospheric variables: mean sea level pressure, 500-hPa geopotential heights, zonal and meridional components of the wind at 10 m, and 850-hPa temperature. Stream discharge was found to have the strongest relationship with KDI, suggesting that sediments and dissolved matter from land runoffs are the key factors linking the atmosphere to water clarity in the Great Lakes. Although generally lower in magnitude than stream discharge, atmospheric circulation patterns associated with increased precipitation tended to have stronger positive correlations with KDI. With no long-range forecasts of stream discharge, the strong relationship between atmospheric circulation patterns and stream discharge may provide an avenue to more accurately model water clarity on a subseasonal-to-seasonal time scale.

T1  - Removal of microplastics from the environment. A review
AN  - 2395154287
AB  - The production of fossil fuel-derived, synthetic plastics is continually increasing, while poor plastic waste management has recently induced severe pollution issues. Microplastics are plastic particles smaller than 5 mm. Microplastics are ubiquitous and slowly-degrading contaminants in waters and soils. Microplastics have long residence time, high stability, high potential of being fragmented and can adsorb other contaminants. Many aquatic species contain microplastics, which are in particular easily accumulated by planktonic and invertebrate organisms. Then, microplastics are transferred along food chains, leading to physical damages, decrease in nutritional diet value and exposure of the living organism to pathogens. Raw plastics contain chemical additives such as phthalates, bisphenol A and polybrominated diphenyl ethers that may induce toxic effects after ingestion by living organisms. Furthermore, the adsorption capability of microplastics makes them prone to carry several contaminants. Methods to remove microplastics from water and other media are actually needed. Here, we review microplastics occurrence, transport, raw polymers and additives, toxicity and methods of removal. Removal methods include physical sorption and filtration, biological removal and ingestion, and chemical treatments. Mechanisms, efficiency, advantages, and drawbacks of various removal methods are discussed.

T1  - Dynamics of nutrient and phytoplankton in Epe Lagoon, Nigeria: possible causes and consequences of reoccurring cyanobacterial blooms
AN  - 2390451695
AB  - The impact of environmental variables and processes of nutrient enrichment on phytoplankton community at Epe lagoon was studied for 18 months (November 2012–April 2014). Two cyanobacterial bloom incidences were observed in the two dry seasons during this period. Rainfall pattern regulated nitrogen limitation which triggered cyanobacterial bloom development and influenced the bloom duration. Nutrient-laden influx from agricultural practices accounted for the increase in nitrate, phosphate and the relatively low silicate. Hypoxic conditions during the two bloom episodes reflected the vulnerability of this lagoon ecosystem. The cyanobacterial blooms were dominated by potentially toxic species; Anabaena circinalis, A. flos-aquae, A. limnetica and A. spiroides. A comparison of ambient nutrient ratios with the Redfield ratio (N/P/Si = 16:1:16) showed clear temporal variations that coincided with phytoplankton dynamics and the bloom regime. Low N/P ratios were recorded during the first 8 months, and there was a shift to higher ratios during the subsequent 8 months, followed by low N/P ratios in the last 2 months. Higher silicate values coincided with decreased cyanobacterial biomass, cyanobacteria bloom collapse and proliferation of diatoms during the first annual cycle. Cyanobacterial abundance exceeded the alert level 1 and almost reached alert level 2 which call for continuous environmental monitoring and management of coastal waters.

T1  - Molluscan genomics: the road so far and the way forward
AN  - 2377614540
AB  - Mollusca is the second most species-rich phylum within the metazoans, displaying critical economic, ecological and scientific importance. Yet, they are still largely underrepresented with respect to genomic resources. The emergence of next-generation sequencing technologies has revolutionized deep-scale genomic characterization of non-model organisms, and molluscs are slowly entering this transformative era. Here, we provide a historical contextualization of the Genome Revolution in molluscs with a tour de force revision of key research trends observed over the past decade. Omic approaches such as RAD-seq, transcriptome, mitogenome and whole-genome sequencing represent the most significant resources produced for this phylum. Importantly, the molecular mechanisms underscoring multiple biological novelties and adaptations observed in molluscs are starting to be unravelled. In contrast, compared to other metazoan lineages the genomic resources currently available for this lineage still lag far behind. We put forward that to fully grasp the evolutionary and adaptive roads of this tantalizing group of organisms crucially depends on the full embracement of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies in the near future.

AN  - 2375299449
AB  - Exposure to toxic contaminants in the environment harms human and animal health and disturbs the integrity and function of the impacted ecosystem. The impact could be local, regional, and global. The concentration of a toxic substance below or above detection limits or thresholds in environmental samples is frequently recorded as non-detect. We discuss inferences based on exact and modified likelihood methods for the location-scale family with values below the detection limit, and as a special case for the normal distribution with a comparison between the methods. We demonstrate the procedure using Niagara River monitoring data.

T1  - Moving Toward an Agenda on Ocean Health and Human Health in Europe
AN  - 2352235641
AB  - The integrated study of ocean health and human health is an emerging area of increasing global importance. Growing evidences demonstrate that the health of the ocean and the health of humans have always been and will continue to be, inextricably linked. Our actions towards the oceans will significantly influence the future of the whole planet and, in turn, our own health. The current review of these issues arose from a summer school in San Sebastian (Spain), from 5th-7th June, 2019. An interdisciplinary group of researchers discussed key risks (e.g. microbial pollution, pharmaceuticals, harmful algal blooms, plastic pollution) and benefits (e.g. bathing waters, recreation, tourism) of the seas and global ocean for humanity; and debated the future priorities and potential actions for a joint Oceans and Human Health research and governance programme in Europe. The aim of this review is to contribute to the emerging scientific agenda on ocean health and human health, as well as coordinate efforts with stakeholders, policy makers and the general public. This agenda operates within the larger context of the upcoming United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development: 2021-2030, which strives to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), including healthy (human) lives and well-being (SDG3) and conserving and sustainably using the oceans (SDG14), among others. In addition to summarising some of the key risks and benefits, therefore, we describe the governance of oceans and health interactions (especially in Europe), and we finish by proposing a list of elements for potential future research priorities on oceans and human health.

T1  - Experimental evidence for the adaptive response of aquatic invertebrates to chronic predation risk
AN  - 2351332749
AB  - As acute stress induced by predation risk can generate significant oxidative damage, prey organisms are forced to balance their defence reaction and the cost of activating the cellular defence system. Stress tolerance differs significantly among species; therefore predator pressure indirectly shapes the community structure. To test adaptation abilities of amphipod crustaceans (Dikerogammarus villosus and Gammarus jazdzewskii) we exposed them to acute (35 min.) and chronic (1 or 7 days) predation risk (the Eurasian perch). We measured respiration (related to metabolic rate), cellular defence systems (antioxidant enzyme (catalase) activity and heat shock protein (Hsp70) concentration), and the level of oxidative damage (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) concentration). Both amphipods increased their respiration rate in the presence of predation cues, irrespective of the duration of their pre-exposure to danger. This increase in D. villosus was initiated more quickly (immediately vs. after 10 min. of the test) and lasted for a longer time (20 vs. 10 min.) than in G. jazdzewskii. However, only G. jazdzewskii after a short exposure to predation risk exhibited an increase in its catalase activity, Hsp70 concentration and oxidative damage. No changes in these parameters were exhibited by D. villosus or after a chronic exposure of G. jazdzewskii to predation cues. Our results show that prey organisms are able to reconfigure their physiology to maintain increased metabolic rate under prolonged predator pressure and, at the same time, reduce oxidative damage as well as costs related to anti-oxidant defence.

T1  - Removal of Heavy Metals in Contaminated Soil by Phytoremediation Mechanism: a Review
AN  - 2343263133
AB  - The rapid development of industrial sector has increased the heavy metal pollution issue recently, as the need of various metals is increasing for manufacturing purpose. These metals are the natural components that can be found in soil, but contamination happens when the concentration of these metals are high in soil due to anthropogenic activities. Several remediation techniques such as physical method, thermal desorption, chemical, and electrokinetic remediation are used to remediate the soil contaminated by heavy metals recently. As these remediation technologies have limitation on cost, effectiveness, and environmental friendly remediation issue, phytoremediation is then attracting the attention from various researchers due to its advantages of efficient, cost-effective, and eco-friendly remediation method. The mechanisms of phytoremediation are phytoextraction, phytostabilization, phytovolatilization, phytodegradation, phytodesalination, rhizofiltration, rhizodegradation, and phytoevaporation. However, these mechanisms were affected by several factors such as the plant species, properties of medium, bioavailability of metal, and the addition of chelating agent. The type of plant utilized for phytoremediation (metallophytes) is categorized as metal indicators, metal excluders, and metal hyperaccumulators. This review article comprehensively discusses the source and effect of heavy metal on human health as well as phytoremediation techniques and mechanism during the heavy metal removal.

T1  - Potential physical effects of suspended fine sediment on lotic macroinvertebrates
AN  - 2343250178
AB  - This study investigates the potential for physical damage caused by suspended fine sediment on gills of three macroinvertebrate species, Hydropsyche siltalai, Ephemera danica and Ecdyonurus venosus. Macroinvertebrate cadavers were exposed to three suspended sediment concentrations (control 3.5, low 83.7 and high 404.0 mg l−1) at two velocities (low 0.19 m s−1 and high 0.37 m s−1), for 6 h in a recirculating flume. Tracheal gill surfaces were subsequently examined for evidence of physical damage using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. Physical damage predominantly consisted of fine sediment coverage of gill surfaces, appearing as a deposited layer of sediment obscuring and potentially clogging the gill. For E. venosus, suspended sediment concentration influenced gill cover, but velocity had no significant effect. Coverage of H. siltalai gill surfaces increased significantly between low and high sediment concentrations but only at the higher flow velocity. Gill coverage of E. danica did not differ across any sediment concentration. The results were consistent with reported species sensitivities to fine sediment, despite the use of cadavers. However, we found limited evidence of physical abrasion as a direct physical effect of fine sediment under the experimental conditions used.

T1  - Health risk assessment of heavy metal accumulation in the Buriganga and Turag River systems for <i>Puntius ticto, Heteropneustes fossilis</i>, and <i>Channa punctatus</i>
AN  - 2267997671
AB  - This study aimed to assess the effects of major ecotoxic heavy metals accumulated in the Buriganga and Turag River systems on the liver, kidney, intestine, and muscle of common edible fish species Puntius ticto, Heteropneustes fossilis, and Channa punctatus and determine the associated health risks. K was the predominant and reported as a major element. A large concentration of Zn was detected in diverse organs of the three edible fishes compared with other metals. Overall, trace metal analysis indicated that all organs (especially the liver and kidney) were under extreme threat because the maximum permissible limit set by different international health organizations was exceeded. The target hazard quotient and target cancer risk due to the trace metal content were the largest for P. ticto. Thus, excessive intake of P. ticto from the rivers Buriganga and Turag could result in chronic risks associated with long-term exposure to contaminants. Histopathological investigations revealed the first detectable indicators of infection and findings of long-term injury in cells, tissues, and organs. Histopathological changes in various tissue structures of fish functioned as key pointers of connection to pollutants, and definite infections and lesion types were established based on biotic pointers of toxic/carcinogenic effects. The analysis of histopathological alterations is a controlling integrative device used to assess pollutants in the environment.

T1  - The Application of Artificial Mussels in Conjunction with Transplanted Bivalves to Assess Elemental Exposure in a Platinum Mining Area
AN  - 2550500642
AB  - There is increasing evidence that platinum group elements (PGE) are pollutants of emerging concern worldwide. Limited information exists on levels, particularly in regions where PGEs are mined. A passive sampling device (i.e., the artificial mussel (AM)) and transplanted indicator organisms (i.e., the freshwater clam Corbicula fluminalis africana) were deployed along a PGE mining gradient in the Hex River, South Africa, and concentrations of As, Cd, Co, Cr, Ni, Pb, Pt, V, and Zn were determined after six weeks of exposure. Results showed differential uptake patterns for Pt, Cr, and Ni between the AMs and clams indicating availability differences. For monitoring purposes, a combination of AMs and indicator organisms provides a more holistic assessment of element exposure in aquatic environments.

T1  - Timescale Methods for Simplifying, Understanding and Modeling Biophysical and Water Quality Processes in Coastal Aquatic Ecosystems: A Review
AN  - 2550500479
AB  - In this article, we describe the use of diagnostic timescales as simple tools for illuminating how aquatic ecosystems work, with a focus on coastal systems such as estuaries, lagoons, tidal rivers, reefs, deltas, gulfs, and continental shelves. Intending this as a tutorial as well as a review, we discuss relevant fundamental concepts (e.g., Lagrangian and Eulerian perspectives and methods, parcels, particles, and tracers), and describe many of the most commonly used diagnostic timescales and definitions. Citing field-based, model-based, and simple algebraic methods, we describe how physical timescales (e.g., residence time, flushing time, age, transit time) and biogeochemical timescales (e.g., for growth, decay, uptake, turnover, or consumption) are estimated and implemented (sometimes together) to illuminate coupled physical-biogeochemical systems. Multiple application examples are then provided to demonstrate how timescales have proven useful in simplifying, understanding, and modeling complex coastal aquatic systems. We discuss timescales from the perspective of “holism”, the degree of process richness incorporated into them, and the value of clarity in defining timescales used and in describing how they were estimated. Our objective is to provide context, new applications and methodological ideas and, for those new to timescale methods, a starting place for implementing them in their own work.

T1  - Perspectives on Micro(Nano)Plastics in the Marine Environment: Biological and Societal Considerations
AN  - 2462597795
AB  - Marine litter is a global problem which has been negatively affecting the environment. Plastic materials are the most commonly found marine debris, with potential biological (not only for aquatic organisms but also for humans) as well as socio-economic impacts. Considering that it is an anthropogenic problem, society could play an important role to minimize it. Although a considerable amount of research has addressed the biological effects of plastics (micro(nano)plastics) on biota, few studies have addressed how scientific information is being transmitted to the public and the potential role of citizen environmental education. The current paper discusses known effects, researched topics and how scientific knowledge is currently being transmitted to the public.

T1  - Drivers of the spatial phytoplankton gradient in estuarine–coastal systems: generic implications of a case study in a Dutch tidal bay
AN  - 2434373240
AB  - As the primary energy and carbon source in aquatic food webs, phytoplankton generally display spatial heterogeneity due to complicated biotic and abiotic controls; however our understanding of the causes of this spatial heterogeneity is challenging, as it involves multiple regulatory mechanisms. We applied a combination of field observation, numerical modeling, and remote sensing to display and interpret the spatial gradient of phytoplankton biomass in a Dutch tidal bay (the Eastern Scheldt) on the east coast of the North Sea. The 19 years (1995–2013) of monitoring data reveal a seaward increasing trend in chlorophyll-a (chl a) concentrations during the spring bloom. Using a calibrated and validated three-dimensional hydrodynamic–biogeochemical model, two idealized model scenarios were run: switching off the suspension feeders and halving the open-boundary nutrient and phytoplankton loading. Results reveal that bivalve grazing exerts a dominant control on phytoplankton in the bay and that the tidal import mainly influences algal biomass near the mouth. Satellite data captured a post-bloom snapshot that indicated the temporally variable phytoplankton distribution. Based on a literature review, we found five common spatial phytoplankton patterns in global estuarine–coastal ecosystems for comparison with the Eastern Scheldt case: seaward increasing, seaward decreasing, concave with a chlorophyll maximum, weak spatial gradients, and irregular patterns. We highlight the temporal variability of these spatial patterns and the importance of anthropogenic and environmental influences.

T1  - Uptake of Sulfate from Ambient Water by Freshwater Animals
AN  - 2407222683
AB  - To better understand how the sulfate (SO42−) anion may contribute to the adverse effects associated with elevated ionic strength or salinity in freshwaters, we measured the uptake and efflux of SO42− in four freshwater species: the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas, Teleostei: Cyprinidae), paper pondshell (Utterbackia imbecillis, Bivalvia: Unionidae), red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii, Crustacea: Cambaridae), and two-lined mayfly (Hexagenia bilineata, Insecta: Ephemeridae). Using δ(34S/32S) stable isotope ratios and the concentrations of S and SO42−, we measured the SO42− influx rate (Jin), net flux (Jnet), and efflux rate (Jout) during a 24 h exposure period. For all four species, the means of Jin for SO42− were positive, and Jin was significantly greater than 0 at both target SO42− concentrations in the fish and mollusk and at the lower SO42− concentration in the crayfish. The means of Jout and Jnet were much more variable than those for Jin, but several species by target SO42− concentration combinations for Jout and Jnet, were negative, which suggests the net excretion of SO42− by the animals. The results of our experiments suggest a greater regulation of SO42− in freshwater animals than has been previously reported.

T1  - Zooplankton Community Responses to Oxygen Stress
AN  - 2375423620
AB  - Recent changes in climate and eutrophication have caused increases in oxygen depletion in both freshwater and marine ecosystems. However, the impact of oxygen stress on zooplankton, which is the major trophic link between primary producers and fish, remains largely unknown in lakes. Therefore, we studied 41 lakes with different trophic and oxygen conditions to assess the role of oxygen stress on zooplankton communities and carbon transfer between phytoplankton and zooplankton. Samples were collected from each lake at the peak of summer stratification from three depth layers (the epilimnion, metalimnion, and hypolimnion). Our results revealed that freshwater zooplankton were relatively tolerant to anoxic conditions and the greatest changes in community structure were found in lakes with the highest oxygen deficits. This caused a switch in dominance from large to small species and reduced the zooplankton biomass in lower, anoxic layers of water, but not in the upper layers of water where the oxygen deficits began. This upper anoxic layer could thus be a very important refuge for zooplankton to avoid predation during the day. However, the reduction of zooplankton in the lower water layers was the main factor that reduced the effectiveness of carbon transfer between the phytoplankton and zooplankton.

T1  - Handling effects on survival and growth of plain pocketbook <i>Lampsilis cardium</i> (Rafinesque, 1820) freshwater mussels
AN  - 2328247127
AB  - Handling freshwater mussels may have negative impacts on their survival, growth, or reproduction, and this may affect our interpretation of how mussels respond to research and conservation actions. The goal of this study was to investigate how repeated dislodgement and emersion during handling affects survival and growth of plain pocketbook Lampsilis cardium. Sixty mussels were exposed to one of the four handling rates: (1) control (no handling), (2) handled every other week, (3) handled once per week, or (4) handled twice per week, during an 85-day laboratory experiment in 2017. Absolute daily growth rates were compared among control and treatment group mussels. Growth rates were positive for > 98% of mussels and no mortality occurred. A likelihood ratio test indicated that growth rates did not differ among treatment groups (χ2 (3) = 1.32, P = 0.72). The best growth rate model was an intercept-only model which predicted that an average mussel grew 0.0088 mm/day (95% confidence interval 0.0070–0.0106). Our results suggest that L. cardium survival and growth is not compromised by short-term, repeated handling as often as twice per week, but consideration of handling procedures and mussel characteristics is necessary to fully understand how handling may affect other mussels.

T1  - Climate projection of Lake Superior under a future warming scenario
AN  - 2408290096
AB  - In a future warming world, a fully dynamical model of Lake Superior projects that the lake will undergo significant physical and biological changes by the middle of the 21st century with important implications for the surrounding region. Projections for the winter include drastically reduced ice and very weak water column stratification. In contrast, the summertime surface warming is projected to begin earlier, last longer, and be more enhanced. In concert, summertime biological production is projected to shift earlier and become larger. These changes have potentially important consequences for stakeholders with interests in shipping, coastal habitability, fishing, water quality, and recreation. Perhaps more fundamentally, the projected changes imply that Lake Superior may change into a different kind of lake with a dramatically weakened dimictic behavior.

T1  - Changes in benthic community composition associated with the outbreak of the corallimorph, <i>Rhodactis howesii</i>, at Palmyra Atoll
AN  - 2272482254
AB  - Few studies have documented the spatial and temporal dynamics of highly invasive species in coral reef benthic communities. Here, we quantified the ecological dynamics of invasion by a corallimorph, Rhodactis howesii, at Palmyra Atoll in the central Pacific. A localized outbreak of this species was first observed following a shipwreck at Palmyra in 1991 and has subsequently spread across hectares, reaching 100% cover in some areas. We examined the spatial and temporal dynamics of this invasion, and its impact on the benthic community, using a combination of permanent photoquadrats and large-scale photomosaic imagery. Our data revealed two distinct patterns in the spatial dynamics of R. howesii on the reef. First, following the removal of the shipwreck in 2013, the cover of the corallimorph in the immediate vicinity of the wreck decreased markedly, with crustose coralline algae (CCA), an important reef-builder, dominating the newly available substrate. However, in contrast to the decline at the epicenter of the invasion, the corallimorph has spread to additional sites around the atoll where increases in abundance have been associated with decreases in hard coral cover. Reductions in percent cover and corallimorph patch size near the epicenter of the outbreak, coupled with increases in cover and patch size and appearance of the corallimorph at other locations around Palmyra, demonstrate the dynamic nature of this “invasion.” Further, we found that the corallimorph settled disproportionately often on patches of turf or CCA cover, but can then overgrow all benthic competitors following establishment. This study provides evidence that R. howesii has the capacity to be highly invasive on coral reefs and highlights the importance of large-scale, long-term monitoring efforts to capture the dynamic nature of such invasions.

T1  - Mussel Caging and the Weight of Evidence Approach in the Assessment of Chemical Contamination in Coastal Waters of Finland (Baltic Sea)
AN  - 2314652467
AB  - Contamination status of coastal areas of Finland (northern Baltic Sea) markedly affected by anthropogenic activities (harbours, shipyards and maritime activity, industry, municipal and agricultural inputs, legacy contamination) was assessed for the first time using the weight of evidence (WOE) approach. The key element of the study was the caging (transplantation) of Baltic mussels (Mytilus trossulus) for the measurement of tissue accumulation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and applying a suite of biomarkers of biological effects of contaminants. Additional variables included in the assessment were trace metals in seawater, macrozoobenthos, near-bottom oxygen levels and eutrophication indicators. The chemical parameters were supported by passive sampling of PAHs and organotins at the study sites. The integrated approach combining all the line of evidence (LOE) variables into the WOE showed separation of some sites as more affected by hazardous substances than others, with the most contaminated areas found around harbour and ship yard areas. The contaminant levels measured in the different matrices were not alarmingly high at none of the areas compared to many other areas within or outside the Baltic Sea under more heavy anthropogenic impact, rarely exceeding any given threshold values for Good Environmental Status of the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive. However, significant biological effects were recorded in mussels in the most contaminated sites, signifying that the combined effects caused by the contaminants and other environmental factors are disturbing the health of marine organisms in the area. The results of this successful combined application based on the mussel transplantation method and the WOE approach are highly encouraging for further trials in developing the monitoring of chemical contamination in the Baltic Sea.

T1  - Production Characteristics and Optimization of Mitigation Mussel Culture
AN  - 2313801024
AB  - Bivalve environmental services have become a focal point for their inherent role in the management of eutrophication, while active cultivation has become increasingly acknowledged as a mechanism for integrated nutrient reduction. In recent years, cultivation practices designed specifically for nutrient extraction have emerged; ‘mitigation culture’. While modeling efforts have been able to describe expanded potential of these services, only a single commercial pilot scale, real-world demonstration, has been documented. Over two production seasons (2017-2018), the optimization of nutrient extractive potential of mussels (Mytilus edulis) at full commercial-scale was evaluated by first testing multiple density configurations of conventional longline-spat collector setups and potential harvest times, then by comparing different cultivation technologies at three farms. Potential biomass volumes of 770-1700 t with longlines and 2100-2600 t on nets was demonstrated in full-scale production (18.8 ha), yielding 0.6-1.27 t N ha-1 and 0.04-0.1 t P ha-1, and 1.63-2.0 t N ha-1 and 0.1-0.12 t P ha-1 respectively. In general, 1 t of harvested mitigation mussels will yield 13.7 kg N and 0.9 kg P. Winter harvests exhibited higher yields (103-124%) than early spring harvests on optimized configurations, favoring an abbreviated production season. Production potential was similar between sites, despite differing environmental conditions, indicating eutrophic waters are suitable for expanded mitigation production. This study presents for the first-time production data of mitigation mussels utilizing different configurations and technologies to maximize yield and nutrient extraction potential.

T1  - Cytotoxic effects of persistent organic pollutants on the freshwater snail (<i>Lanistes carinatus</i>) in Kafr El-Zayat, Egypt
AN  - 2310553843
AB  - Effects of industrial and municipal wastewaters on the freshwater snail, Lanistes carinatus, were evaluated. Concentrations of some chemicals in some effluents were greater than permissible limits promulgated internationally by various jurisdictions. Pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) observed in tissues of snails collected during summer were greater than those measured in snails collected during winter. Catalase activities observed during autumn were greater than those observed during other seasons. Activities of catalase were greater at all sites near sources of contamination than in snails from the reference site (S6). Lactate dehydrogenase activity was also greater at all sites relative to the location designated as the reference (S6), at which activities did not exceed 8.10 U/L. Patterns of genomic DNA in snails, as determined by use of OPA-02 primer, were significantly different among sites. Location S1 (Belshay village) exhibited 11 bands, followed by S2 (El-Demer zone) and S5 (Rosetta branch) which exhibited 6 bands. In contrast, all sites exhibited greater numbers of bands when the OPA-08 primer was used. Thus, DNA fingerprinting, lactate dehydrogenase, and catalase offer useful biomarkers in ecotoxicology and risk assessment programs.

T1  - Evaluating toxicity risk in sediments after remediation at a Superfund megasite using a Triad approach
AN  - 2308386327
AB  - The Pine River downstream of the Velsicol Superfund site has been contaminated with various hydrophobic organic pollutants for more than 50 years. Remediation and sediment dredging near the site began in spring of 1999, and was completed in 2006. In 2011, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality completed a baseline assessment report long-term monitoring plan for the Pine River. However, there has been limited assessment of the benthic community since this evaluation. The objective of this research was to evaluate the risk of Pine River sediment to aquatic macroinvertebrates downstream from the Superfund site after decades of degradation and dredging using the Triad approach. Three sites were selected downstream from the Superfund site, and an upstream reference site was used. At each site, macroinvertebrates surveys were conducted and sediments were collected for chemical analysis of DDT (1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis (4-chlorophenyl) ethane) and its degradation products and for laboratory toxicity testing for mortality and sublethal effects using Hyalella azteca and Chironomus dilutus. Sediment concentrations of DDT, DDD, and DDE were below levels expected to cause toxicity, and there was no observed toxicity in laboratory tests. Additionally, there were no statistically significant differences in richness, richness of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) species, total EPT abundance, percent EPT, or percent dominant taxa between the reference site and the downstream sites. There was an observed decrease in abundance of macroinvertebrate taxa at all downstream sites and a shift in macroinvertebrate structure when comparing the reference with most impaired sites. Although the sites downstream of the Superfund site remain different than the upstream control, there are improvements in species composition and abundance. However, more research is needed to evaluate the potential effects on ecosystem function.

T1  - Source of organic detritus and bivalve biomass influences nitrogen cycling and extracellular enzyme activity in estuary sediments
AN  - 2308386490
AB  - In aquatic ecosystems, natural processes that remove nitrogen from the biologically available pool (e.g. denitrification) have been intensively studied as an ecosystem function that reduces eutrophication. The quantity of sediment organic matter is a key driver of denitrification with percent organic content positively related to rates of nitrogen removal; however, few studies have investigated the influence of the quality of organic matter on nitrogen cycling in estuarine sediments despite shifts in primary producers with eutrophication. This laboratory study using intact benthic communities investigates the influence of various organic detritus sources, which vary in their C:N ratio, on nitrogen gas (N2) and solute fluxes and extracellular enzyme activity in estuarine sediments. A custom-built tank with a removable front plate was used with a planar optode film to image sediment oxygenation. Mangrove leaf detritus significantly increased the net N2 production in sediments, while the deposition of other detrital sources and control sediments produced net N2 consumption. Sulfatase activity was significantly reduced in the mangrove leaves and seagrass treatments, suggesting alteration of heterotrophic microbial activity with reducing oxygen conditions. Leucine aminopeptidase activity, indicating nitrogen cycling, was reduced in all treatments, suggesting the organic detritus provided a nitrogen supplement or reduced the activity of extracellular enzymes producing microbes. Bivalve biomass increased net nitrogen gas fluxes in some treatments. Our results indicate different detrital sources may have varying impacts on the removal of bioavailable nitrogen through denitrification and show that feedbacks in biogeochemical cycles may occur with changes in organic detrital source pools.

T1  - An assessment of temporal trends in mercury concentrations in fish
AN  - 2300453156
AB  - The importance of fish consumption as the primary pathway of human exposure to mercury and the establishment of fish consumption advisories to protect human health have led to large fish tissue monitoring programs worldwide. Data on fish tissue mercury concentrations collected by state, tribal, and provincial governments via contaminant monitoring programs have been compiled into large data bases by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Great Lakes National Monitoring Program Office (GLNPO), the Ontario Ministry of the Environment’s Fish Contaminants Monitoring and Surveillance Program (FMSP), and many others. These data have been used by a wide range of governmental and academic investigators worldwide to examine long-term and recent trends in fish tissue mercury concentrations. The largest component of the trend literature is for North American freshwater species important in recreational fisheries. This review of temporal trends in fish tissue mercury concentrations focused on published results from freshwater fisheries of North America as well as marine fisheries worldwide. Trends in fish tissue mercury concentrations in North American lakes with marked overall decreases were reported over the period 1972–2016. These trends are consistent with reported mercury emission declines as well as trends in wet deposition across the U.S. and Canada. More recently, a leveling-off in the rate of decreases or increases in fish tissue mercury concentrations has been reported. Increased emissions of mercury from global sources beginning between 1990 and 1995, despite a decrease in North American emissions, have been advanced as an explanation for the observed changes in fish tissue trends. In addition to increased atmospheric deposition, the other factors identified to explain the observed mercury increases in the affected fish species include a systematic shift in the food-web structure with the introduction of non-native species, creating a new or expanding role for sediments as a net source for mercury. The influences of climate change have also been identified as contributing factors, including considerations such as increases in temperature (resulting in metabolic changes and higher uptake rates of methylmercury), increased rainfall intensity and runoff (hydrologic export of organic matter carrying HgII from watersheds to surface water), and water level fluctuations that alter either the methylation of mercury or the mobilization of monomethylmercury. The primary source of mercury exposure in the human diet in North America is from the commercial fish and seafood market which is dominated (>90%) by marine species. However, very little information is available on mercury trends in marine fisheries. Most of the data used in the published marine trend studies are assembled from earlier reports. The data collection efforts are generally intermittent, and the spatial and fish-size distribution of the target species vary widely. As a result, convincing evidence for the existence of fish tissue mercury trends in marine fish is generally lacking. However, there is some evidence from sampling of large, long-lived commercially-important fish showing both lower mercury concentrations in the North Atlantic in response to reduced anthropogenic mercury emission rates in North America and increases in fish tissue mercury concentrations over time in the North Pacific in response to increased mercury loading.

T1  - Biochemical responses of freshwater mussel <i>Unio tumidus</i> to titanium oxide nanoparticles, Bisphenol A, and their combination
AN  - 2270824765
AB  - Multiple interactions between different pollutants in the surface waters can cause unpredictable consequences. The aim of the study was to evaluate the combined effect of two widespread xenobiotics, titanium oxide nanoparticles (TiO2) and bisphenol A (BPA), on freshwater bivalve Unio tumidus. The specimens were exposed for 14 days to TiCl4 (Ti, 1.25 µM), TiO2 (1.25 μM), BPA (0.88 nM), or their combination (TiO2 + BPA). Every type of exposure resulted in a particular oxidative stress response: TiO2 had antioxidant effect, decreasing the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and phenoloxidase (PhO) activity, and doubling reduced glutathione (GSH) concentration in the digestive gland; Ti caused oxidative changes by increasing levels of ROS, PhO and superoxide dismutase; BPA decreased the GSH level by a factor of two. In the co-exposure treatment, these indices as well as lysosomal membrane stability were not affected. All Ti-containing exposures caused elevated levels of metalated metallothionein (Zn,Cu-MT), its ratio to total metallothionein protein, and lactate/pyruvate ratio. Both BPA-containing exposures decreased caspase-3 activity. All exposures, and particularly co-exposure, up-regulated CYP450-dependent oxidation, lipid peroxidation and lipofuscin accumulation, lysosomal cathepsin D and its efflux, as well as alkali-labile phosphates in gonads and caused DNA instability (except for TiO2). To summarize, co-exposure to TiO2 + BPA produced an overlap of certain individual responses but strengthened the damage. Development of water purification technologies using TiO2 requires further studies of the biological effects of its mixtures. U. tumidus can serve as a sentinel organism in such studies.

T1  - Short-term toxicity effects of <i>Prymnesium parvum</i> on zooplankton community composition
AN  - 2258057729
AB  - Harmful algal blooms (HABs) can disrupt aquatic communities through a variety of mechanisms, especially through toxin production. Herbivorous and omnivorous zooplankton may be particularly susceptible to HAB toxins, due to their close trophic relationship to algae as grazers. In this study, the acute toxigenic effects of the haptophyte Prymnesium parvum on a zooplankton community were investigated under laboratory conditions. Total zooplankton abundances decreased during 48-h exposure, although species responses to P. parvum densities varied. Changes in community composition were driven by declines in Daphnia mendotae and Keratella spp. abundances, which resulted in an average shift in copepod abundance from 47.1 to 72.4%, and rotifer abundance from 35.0 to 7.1%. Total cladocerans were relatively unchanged in relative abundance (11.1–10.4%), though the dominant cladoceran shifted from Daphnia mendotae (61.3% of cladocerans) to Bosmina longirostris (81.5% of cladocerans). Daphnia mendotae and Keratella spp. are known to be non-selective or generalist feeders and were likely harmed through a combination of ingestion of and contact by P. parvum. Proportional increases in copepod and Bosmina abundances in the presence of P. parvum likely reflect selective or discriminate feeding abilities in these taxa. This study corroborates previous field studies showing that P. parvum can negatively affect zooplankton, reflecting species-specific differences in zooplankton-P. parvum interactions. Such changes can alter zooplankton community composition, leading to substantial food-web consequences and potential long-term ecosystem-level impacts in lakes that experience blooms.

T1  - The systems approach framework for collaborative, science-based management of complex systems
AN  - 2166887042
AB  - Sustainable management of coastal systems can only be achieved with an effective science-policy interface that integrates the three pillars of sustainable development: environmental protection, social progress and economic growth. The Systems Approach Framework (SAF) provides a structure to guide such a process by embracing the challenge of assessing complex systems for scenario simulations to support potential policy decisions. Based on applications of the SAF in six Baltic Sea case studies within the BONUS BaltCoast project, the SAF was revisited and further developed. Two additional steps were introduced partly to enhance implementation and decision validation and partly to facilitate the reiterative process with the addition of monitoring and evaluation. The SAF now includes six steps (Issue Identification, System Design, System Formulation, System Assessment, Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation). A list of actions for each step clearly defines what needs to be done before progressing to the next SAF step. Activities within each step were improved to better integrate governance - citizen collaboration and improve the science-policy interface. Three auxiliary tools, developed in the BONUS BaltCoast project to support particular actions, were integrated in the different steps to facilitate application of the SAF by practitioners and scientists alike. The added focus on the stakeholder participation resulted in further actions being listed in the new steps to maintain stakeholder engagement and counteract stakeholder fatigue. The revised SAF is presented and discussed together with lessons learned from the different applications in five Baltic Sea study sites.

T1  - Gonadal Histopathological Disorders in Mytilus galloprovincialis Male Exposed to Tars Used in Mussel Farms
AN  - 2289718633
AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and trace metals are pollutants widely distributed in the marine environment with toxic effects on live organisms, but few laboratory studies have proved their causal relationship with histopathologic alterations from invertebrates. We analyse the histopathologic effects of a tar mixture used in mussel farms on the gonad of male mussels. Mussels were exposed to water-accommodated fractions from different sub-lethal concentrations of that tar mixture during different times. The accumulation of PAHs and metals in mussels was quantified in each one tar exposure condition, and a comparative histological and morphometric analysis of the male gonad was performed, as well as of the gametogenic disorders and the cellular pathologies induced. Spermatogenesis disruption and alterations of somatic and germinal cells were observed as a direct effect of treatment. The pathologies observed followed an increasing malignity sequence depending on dose and exposure time: spawning induction; arrest of spermatogenesis and spermiogenesis; suppression of immune response; dysplasia of Sertoli and connective cells and finally, severe disorders of germinal cells. We demonstrate for the first time that tar used in waterproofing of floating rafts from the mussel farms causes severe effects on male mussel gonad, constituting a direct risk to the health of these organisms, affecting gametogenesis, quality of gametes and, ultimately, the sustainability of this resource and their quality for human consumption. Moreover, we propose the pathologies described in mussel as biomarkers of marine pollution and the mussel gonad as study model of testicular toxicity mechanisms in male reproduction.

T1  - Transcriptomic Analysis of the Onchidium reevesii Central Nervous System in Response to Cadmium
AN  - 2284656301
AB  - Shellfish are widely used in coastal environments for biomonitoring of heavy metal pollution. Research on the sea slug Onchidium reevesii, an economically important benthic gastropod, is limited due to a lack of genomic resources. This study, based on Illumina sequencing, compared the transcriptomes of O. reevesii before and after cadmium exposure, and used time-series expression analysis. The molecular level stress response mechanism operating in this organism in environmental stress conditions was investigated. De novo assembly of the O. reevesii transcriptome yielded 51,007 unigenes, of which 14,774 were annotated. Time-series expression analyses resulted in clustering of most responsive transcripts into 16 statistically significant expression profiles. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis based on time-series expression identified metal ion binding, synaptic transmission, and oxidative stress as important biological processes, and expression analysis identified genes related to invertebrate responses to environmental stress. Furthermore, we have generated the first transcriptome of O. reevesii, and the extensive sequence data produced will provide valuable molecular resources for study of the response of O. reevesii to cadmium exposure.

T1  - The lampenflora in show caves and its treatment: an emerging ecological problem
AN  - 2412999882
AB  - The artificial lighting of caves adapted for touristic visits, leads to the appearance and propagation of a complex community of phototrophic organisms known as "lampenflora". Formed mainly by algae and cyanobacteria, they produce the degradation of the colonized substrates and decrease the show value of the caves. This phenomenon became famous worldwide in the 1960s due to the damage caused to the paintings in the Lascaux Cave (France). Since then it has become an issue of serious concern to both managers of show caves and to the international scientific community. Over time, the problem has been approached following two complementary strategies: preventing colonization by the invading organisms or eliminating them once they have become established through the use of chemical products, mainly biocides and strong oxidants. This kind of treatment generates pollutant effluents that can move the problem from the walls of the caves to the groundwater. This paper presents a critical literature review of the problem and the proposed solutions, and emphasizes the need for further study of the optimal doses of treatment chemicals and to develop quantitative methods to determine their effectiveness.

T1  - Influences of Lake Trout (<i>Salvelinus namaycush</i>) and <i>Mysis diluviana</i> on kokanee (<i>Oncorhynchus nerka</i>) in Lake Pend Oreille, Idaho
AN  - 2175714439
AB  - Research on Lake Pend Oreille, Idaho, has focused on the influence of two potential limiting factors for kokanee Oncorhynchus nerka (Walbaum, 1792): competition for food with Mysis diluviana (Loven, 1862, hereafter Mysis) and predation by lake trout Salvelinus namaycush (Walbaum, 1792). Population fluctuations of Mysis and lake trout have resulted in substantial heterogeneity in food web conditions, apparently altering both bottom-up and top-down dynamics. Therefore, relative importance of predation and competition were evaluated as drivers of kokanee abundance, biomass, and production. A series of general linear models was used to evaluate relative influences of Mysis and lake trout on kokanee. Kokanee production was a density-dependent process and the collapse of Mysis corresponded to an increase in the modeled maximum annual production of kokanee from 224 tonnes to 408 tonnes. Lake trout also negatively influenced kokanee biomass. A Mysis-mediated, predator-induced kokanee biomass collapse occurred when lake trout and Mysis abundances were both high. Sustainable management of this fishery requires recognition that competition with Mysis will define the scope of kokanee production and therefore the scope of sustainable predation.

T1  - Alternative host identity and lake morphometry drive trematode transmission in brook charr
AN  - 2251465032
AB  - Both biotic and abiotic factors have been invoked to explain the large variations observed in the prevalence and abundance of parasites in aquatic ecosystems. However, we have only a poor knowledge of the potential interplay among these factors in natural systems. It is, therefore, important to analyze the effects of multiple potential environmental drivers together to get an integrated view of their influence on the prevalence and abundance of parasites. To this end, we selected two genera of digenean trematode parasites that require at least two hosts to complete their life cycle and use two different transmission strategies. Crepidostomum moves through a trophic pathway via consumption of infected prey by the host, while Apophallus infects its hosts via direct penetration of their skin. This study was conducted in 23 Canadian Shield lakes exhibiting orthogonal gradients of biotic (fish species richness and biomass) and abiotic (morphometry, physico-chemical) variables. We quantified prevalence and abundance of these parasites in the skin and intestine of brook charr (Salvelinus fontinalis). Our results show that biotic factors are key drivers of parasite abundance and prevalence, with Apophallus being negatively associated with the fish species richness–biomass gradient, and Crepidostomum responding more to identity of host than to the diversity gradient. Among the abiotic variables, lake area was found to be positively related to both prevalence and abundance in Apophallus. Our results suggest that taking into account the interplay of both biotic and abiotic factors is crucial for understanding patterns of parasite transmission success in boreal lakes.

T1  - Combining biomarker and community approaches using benthic macroinvertebrates can improve the assessment of the ecological status of rivers
AN  - 2238821045
AB  - Indices based on community structure provide a global ecological status of the biological communities but they are of limited value as early-warning indicators of contamination. Almost two decades after the Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) was adopted, we reviewed publications that measured biomarkers in benthic macroinvertebrates in biomonitoring programmes of fluvial systems. The focus was on studies that attempted to incorporate both biomarkers and community-based approaches in the evaluation of the ecological status of rivers and streams. Overall, the data showed that biomarker measurements in benthic macroinvertebrate species can offer complementary information on the factors threatening these communities. This information is particularly useful for water authorities, in order to take actions before a system collapses into a state from which recovery is difficult or impossible. Gaps in need to be addressed for rapid and efficient implementation of biomarkers in benthic macroinvertebrates in routine wide-scale monitoring are discussed. In particular, site-specific baselines have to be defined, taking into account the influence of biotic and abiotic factors on these biochemical responses. Further studies, including different biomarkers, environmental stressors, macroinvertebrate taxa and river types, will provide crucial information on how to establish adequate biomarker strategies to indicate future ecological damage.

TT  - Influencia de las variables ambientales en comunidades de macroinvertebrados bénticos en un lago poco profundo de tierras bajas eutróficas (lago Ge, China)
AN  - 2266901107
AB  - Shallow lowland lakes are critical components of the water cycle, providing an essential service function. However, the impacts of microcystin from phytoplankton communities on benthic macroinvertebrate community diversity and structure have seldom been investigated. During 2008-2012, the impacts of water environmental variables on the diversity of macrobenthic communities, including water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, transparency, conductivity, the permanganate index, Chlorophyll a, total phosphorus, total nitrogen, and microcystin-LR (L for leucine and R for arginine), were measured in a typical shallow lowland lake, Ge Lake. The results of the present study demonstrated that there were 31 benthic macroinvertebrate taxa in Ge Lake, including 7 oligochaetes, 7 Mollusca, 14 chironomids, and 3 other taxa. Among the macrobenthic taxa in the benthic community, opportunistic taxa such as Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri are present and can occur at greater densities in disturbed habitats. However, a significant reduction/disappearance of sensitive and clean taxa was observed among the benthic macroinvertebrates. Water temperature, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, ammonia nitrogen, transparency and total phosphorus were the main environmental variables influencing macrobenthic community structure, while water temperature, conductivity, ammonia nitrogen, Chlorophyll a, the permanganate index, total phosphorus and total nitrogen were the main factors that influenced macrobenthic community diversity indices (the numbers of taxa, Shannon's diversity index, Margalef's richness index, and Pielou's evenness index). Our results underscore the severity of the effects of human activity on Ge Lake and strongly suggest that restoring the benthic invertebrate community to previous conditions would require the control and reduction of environmental pollutants and nutrients in Ge Lake.

T1  - Threats Underestimated in Freshwater Plastic Pollution: Mini-Review
AN  - 2257156217
AB  - Plastic pollution is one of the most acute environmental topics of our time. While there is a great scientific effort to tackle this problem, it has not always been well-coordinated or properly targeted. In this short review, we call for scientists to get involved in three crucial topics (threats) underestimated—or ignored—in freshwater systems: (i) plastic-species entanglement, (ii) plastic as nesting material, and (iii) macroplastic debris coming from mismanaged household solid waste. Reducing the knowledge gaps between marine and freshwater environments will be crucial to solute the plastic pollution problem effectively and globally. Therefore, we make a plea here to reinforce research activities on these three issues in freshwater environments worldwide.

T1  - Relative Contributions of DNRA and Denitrification to Nitrate Reduction in <i>Thalassia testudinum</i> Seagrass Beds in Coastal Florida (USA)
AN  - 2199003502
AB  - Seagrass beds are vulnerable to eutrophication (nutrient loading) and declining worldwide. To quantify the fate of nitrogen (N) inputs, intact sediment cores were incubated in a continuous-flow system with 15N enrichments to compare N consumption and efflux pathways within and near seagrass (Thalassia testudinum) beds in St. Joseph Bay, Florida. Sediment oxygen demand and total ammonium (NH4+) efflux were greater (p < 0.001) in vegetated versus unvegetated sediments, suggesting that seagrasses enhance organic matter remineralization. Denitrification rates were 2–20× greater than estimates of potential dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA). The effect of vegetation on denitrification rates was inconsistent. Direct denitrification of overlying water nitrate and N fixation rates were low, suggesting tight coupling between remineralization, nitrification, and denitrification. DNRA rates were lower than denitrification and consistently greater in vegetated sediments. DNRA rate measurements are conservative if sediment cation exchange decreases the fraction of 15NH4+ reaching overlying water, especially in vegetated sediments, where rates of nitrate-induced ammonium fluxes were observed. Coupled nitrification-denitrification was the major N loss pathway in this system, as evidenced by the lack of 15N-labeled N2 production in isotope-enriched cores. Using measured sediment oxygen demand and NH4+ fluxes as an indicator of organic matter quality and quantity, these results are consistent with previous work showing that labile organic matter helps regulate the balance between N removal and internal recycling pathways in seagrass systems, which has implications for coastal management strategies to address eutrophication.

T1  - Comparison of some epigean and troglobiotic animals regarding their metabolism intensity. Examination of a classical assertion
AN  - 2412494784
AB  - This study determines oxygen consumption (R), electron transport system (ETS) activity and R/ETS ratio in two pairs of epigean and hypogean crustacean species or subspecies. To date, metabolic characteristics among the phylogenetic distant epigean and hypogean species (i.e., species of different genera) or the epigean and hypogean populations of the same species have been studied due to little opportunity to compare closely related epigean and hypogean species. To fill this gap, we studied the epigean Niphargus zagrebensis and its troglobiotic relative Niphargus stygius, and the epigean subspecies Asellus aquaticus carniolicus in comparison to the troglobiotic subspecies Asellus aquaticus cavernicolus. We tested the previous findings of different metabolic rates obtained on less-appropriate pairs of species and provide additional information on thermal characteristics of metabolic enzymes in both species or subspecies types. Measurements were done at four temperatures. The values of studied traits, i.e., oxygen consumption, ETS activity, and ratio R/ETS, did not differ significantly between species or subspecies of the same genus from epigean and hypogean habitats, but they responded differently to temperature changes. Higher Q10-values for oxygen consumption of N. stygius than N. zagrebensis in the temperature range 10-20C and higher Ea indicated higher thermal sensitivity in the subterranean species. On the other hand, lower Q10 and Ea-values for ETS activity of N. stygius than N. zagrebensis indicated more thermally stable enzymatic machinery in N. stygius than N. zagrebensis. In Asellus, we observed a similar trend of lower Ea for oxygen consumption and higher Ea for ETS activity in epigean than the troglomorphic subspecies, but the values did not differ significantly between the two. Our most important conclusion is that the low metabolic rate is not a universal property of troglobiotic animals, and the degree of metabolic adaptation is not necessarily in agreement with the degree of morphological adaptation (troglomorphy).

T1  - Comparison of phosphorus sorption characteristics in the soils of riparian buffer strips with different land use patterns and distances from the shoreline around Lake Chaohu
AN  - 2163555089
AB  - PurposeThe construction of riparian buffer strips has become increasingly important due to the effective phosphorus (P) retention of the strips, thus preventing eutrophication in freshwater ecosystems. The key mechanism is P sorption in soils. To provide some suggestions for increasing the sorption ability of P, the relationships between P sorption behavior and both land use patterns and distance from the shoreline were determined.Materials and methodsIn April, July, and October 2013, field investigations were carried out along the shoreline of Lake Chaohu. Eleven sections, including 36 sampling sites at different distances from the shoreline, were chosen, and these sections contained different types of riparian buffer strips, such as grassland, farmland, forest, wetland, and forest/grassland. The P species, sorption parameters, and dominant vegetation species were analyzed.Results and discussionThe total P (TP) and P sorption maximum (Qmax) showed no recognizable seasonal variation and were closely correlated with the distance from the shoreline. The further the distance from the shoreline, the higher the TP and Qmax values, suggesting that soil traits could determine the P sorption extent. However, the Olsen-P content and equilibrium P concentration (EPC0) fluctuated greatly, with the peak occurring in spring and the minimum occurring in summer in the majority of the sampling sites. In addition, positive relationships existed between the TP content and the Qmax value as well as the Olsen-P content and the EPC0 value. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) further showed that the Olsen-P content and EPC0 values were closely related to the dominant vegetation species, indicating that land use patterns played a decisive role in regulating the P sorption strength and the level of available P.ConclusionsTo effectively adsorb P (increase Qmax) and prevent P leaching (reduce the EPC0), we recommend changing the land use patterns (more constructed wetlands and forests with grass) in riparian buffers.

T1  - STATE OF THE LAKE MICHIGAN PELAGIC FISH COMMUNITY IN 2016 5
AN  - 2717340822
AB  - The fish community objectives (FCOs) for Lake Michigan seek to restore and maintain the biological integrity of the fish community so that production of desirable fish is sustainable and ecologically efficient. The ecological efficiency of the Lake Michigan fish community is a function of how energy from pelagic and benthic invertebrates is transferred to planktivorous fish and the predators that consume them. Fishery managers on Lake Michigan seek to maintain a diverse and balanced salmonine predator and planktivore community in the offshore pelagic zone so that predator demand does not exceed prey-fish production, which would erode the integrity and efficiency of the community. Here, Claramunt et al assess the state of Lake Michigan's pelagic fish community.

T1  - Bioreactivity and Microbiome of Biodeposits from Filter-Feeding Bivalves
AN  - 2163552491
AB  - Bivalves serve an important ecosystem function in delivering organic matter from pelagic to benthic zones and are important in mediating eutrophication. However, the fate of this organic matter (i.e., biodeposits) is an important consideration when assessing the ecological roles of these organisms in coastal ecosystems. In addition to environmental conditions, the processing of biodeposits is dependent on its composition and the metabolic capacity of the associated microbial community. The objectives of this study were to compare the biological reactivity, potential denitrification rates, and microbial communities of biodeposits sourced from different bivalve species: hard clam (Mercenaria mercenaria), eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica), and ribbed mussel (Geukensia demissa). To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate and compare the microbiome of bivalve biodeposits using high-throughput sequencing and provide important insight into the mechanisms by which bivalves may alter sediment microbial communities and benthic biogeochemical cycles. We show that clam biodeposits had significantly higher bioreactivity compared to mussel and oyster biodeposits, as reflected in higher dissolved inorganic carbon and ammonium production rates in controlled incubations. Potential denitrification rates were also significantly higher for clam biodeposits compared to oyster and mussel biodeposits. The microbial communities associated with the biodeposits were significantly different across bivalve species, with significantly greater abundances of Alteromonadales, Chitinophagales, Rhodobacterales, and Thiotrichales associated with the clam biodeposits. These bioreactivity and microbial differences across bivalve species are likely due to differences in bivalve physiology and feeding behavior and should be considered when evaluating the effects of bivalves on water quality and ecosystem function.

T1  - A first study on the effect of dietary soya levels and crystalline isoflavones on growth, gonad development and gonad histology of farmed abalone, <i>Haliotis midae</i>
AN  - 2133675361
AB  - Soya in formulated diets for abalone, Haliotis midae, can improve somatic growth. However, it may also influence gonad development, thereby limiting the potential benefit of including soya in feed. This is the first study to determine both the effect of dietary soya level on growth and reproduction of abalone and the role of crystalline isoflavones (ISO) at concentrations occurring in soya diets. Abalone (40–50 g individual−1) were fed seven isonitrogenous and isoenergetic diets. Three diets contained 5, 10 or 19% soya, while an additional three diets included graded levels of ISO. A fishmeal (FM)-only diet was included. The inclusion of ISO did not influence gonad development or abalone growth while soya inclusion level had an effect on both reproductive development and abalone growth. After 180 days, male abalone fed FM with soya inclusion had the highest whole body mass (69.0 ± 2.48 g abalone−1), meat mass index (60.5 ± 1.88%), visceral mass index (13.0 ± 0.27%) and gonad bulk index (42.7 ± 9.82 g abalone−1). Weight loss was observed in all treatments probably due to spawning events. The frequency distribution of the predominant oocyte stage, stage 7 was influenced by soya concentration. The increase in the frequency of stage 7 oocytes in abalone fed FM with soya did not reduce the number of oocytes (45.0 ± 3.01 oocytes mm−2), while the number of oocytes (o) in abalone fed the FM-only diets decreased with increasing abundance of stage 7 oocytes, possibly due to an increase in oocyte size.

T1  - Managing Eutrophication in the Szczecin (Oder) Lagoon-Development, Present State and Future Perspectives
AN  - 2308104692
AB  - High riverine nutrient loads caused poor water quality, low water transparency and an unsatisfactory ecological status in the Szczecin (Oder) Lagoon, a trans-boundary water at the southern shore of the Baltic Sea. Total annual riverine N (P) loads into the lagoon raised at the 20th century from approx. 14,000~t~TN (1,000~t~TP) to 115,000~t~TN (10,500~t~TP) in the 1980ties and declined to about 56,750~t~TN (2,800~t~TP) after 2010. Nutrient concentrations, water transparency (Secchi depth) and chlorophyll-a showed a positive response to the reduced nutrient loads in the Polish eastern lagoon. This was not the case in the German western lagoon, where summer Secchi depth is 0.6 m and mean chlorophyll-a concentration is four times above the threshold for the Good Ecological Status. Measures to improve the water quality focused until now purely on nutrient load reductions, but the nutrient load targets and Maximal Allowable Inputs are contradicting between EU Water Framework Directive and EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive. According to the HELCOM Baltic Sea Action Plan, the thresholds of the annual riverine nutrient inputs to the lagoon would be about 48,850~t~N (1,570~t~P). Actions in the river basins that would allow meeting these targets are hardly achievable. Even if the load targets would be fully implemented, they are not sufficient to transfer the lagoon into a non-eutrophic state. The implementation of EU Water Framework Directive is further hampered, as consistent water quality thresholds for the two parts of Szczecin Lagoon are missing. An approach to harmonize them is presented, which incorporates the spatial differences. By implementing consistent water quality targets, Szczecin Lagoon could serve as blueprint for other trans-boundary waters. In the western lagoon, nutrient load reductions in the past decades had no effect on the water quality. High water residence times, frequent sediment resuspension and the missing submerged vegetation inhibit the load reduction effects on the water quality. Internal measures in the western lagoon are necessary, which aim at removing nutrients and$\/$ or increasing water transparency to overcome the hysteresis effect and to initiate a recovery of macrophytes. The most promising approach seems the cultivation of zebra mussels.

T1  - Do native white-clawed crayfish impact macroinvertebrate assemblages in Mediterranean limestone headwaters?
AN  - 2582791430
AB  - Crayfish are among the largest aquatic macroinvertebrates in rivers and streams. Their trophic ecology is important for the understanding of the functioning of benthic communities. This is relevant in key areas, such as headwaters, as they partly condition the processes occurring downstream. To shed light on the effects of native white-clawed crayfish, Austropotamobius pallipes, on local macroinvertebrate assemblages from running headwaters, a three-month mesocosm-based field study was designed. Collection and subsequent analysis of benthic samples under different crayfish density levels yielded a set of metrics indicative of short-term impacts at general and taxonomic scales. Neither significant positive nor negative effects on the community were evident in terms of richness, diversity, dominance and biomass. A combination of highly patched distributions of macroinvertebrates along with a weak impact of crayfish foraging activity is considered to explain this lack of effects. Only temporal changes associated with particular biological cycles appeared for some of the main taxa. Based on the results, we are not able to determine whether the white-clawed crayfish perceptibly disturbs the structure and composition of the local macroinvertebrate assemblages in the short-term. Thus, its use in future restocking projects is supported.Alternate abstract: Les écrevisses sont parmi les plus gros macroinvertébrés aquatiques dans les rivières et les ruisseaux. Leur écologie trophique est importante pour la compréhension du fonctionnement des communautés benthiques. C'est pertinent dans des domaines clés, tels que les eaux d'amont, car elles conditionnent en partie les processus qui se produisent en aval. Pour faire la lumière sur les effets de l'écrevisse à pieds blancs, Austropotamobius pallipes, sur les assemblages de macroinvertébrés locaux des eaux d'amont, une étude de trois mois en mésocosme sur le terrain a été conçue. Collecte et analyse d'échantillons benthiques selon les niveaux de densité différentes en écrevisses ont donné un ensemble de paramètres indicatifs des impacts à court terme à l'échelle générale et taxonomique. Aucun effet positif ou négatif important sur la communauté n'était évident en termes de richesse, de diversité, de dominance et de biomasse. On considère que cette absence d'effets s'explique par la combinaison d'une distribution de macroinvertébrés très hétérogène et d'un faible impact de l'activité de recherche de nourriture des écrevisses. Seuls des changements temporels associés à des cycles biologiques particuliers sont apparus pour certains des principaux taxons. D'après les résultats, nous ne sommes pas en mesure de déterminer si l'écrevisse à pattes blanches perturbe à court terme de façon perceptible la structure et la composition des assemblages locaux de macroinvertébrés. Ainsi, son utilisation dans les futurs projets de repeuplement est confortée.

T1  - Diets and Trophic Structure of Fish Assemblages in a Large and Unexplored Subtropical River: The Uruguay River
AN  - 2550492419
AB  - The Neotropics represent a hotspot for freshwater biodiversity with vast number of fish species of scarce ecological knowledge. This holds true for the Uruguay River, where fish assemblages and their diets remain unexplored. Fish assemblages were surveyed in 14 sites along the river main course, from headwaters to mouth (approximately 1800 km), with the aim to identify the trophic roles of fishes and to describe trophic structure of these assemblages, following standardized sampling campaigns and laboratory procedures. One hundred species (2309 gut contents) were analysed and classified into four trophic groups subdivided into eight lower-level groups: Piscivore, piscivore-invertivore, detritivore, omnivore-detritivore, omnivore-invertivore, omnivore-planktivore and omnivore-herbivore. The trophic structure of the assemblages varied along the river, with the relative species richness of fish consuming terrestrial invertebrates increasing towards the middle river section, probably driven by the large floodplains in that areas, supporting global theories such as the flood pulse concept. This study describes the feeding habits of fish along the Uruguay River, being the first dietary description for 29 species. This knowledge is essential for management and conservation, serving as baseline in the context of future environmental changes while generating novel evidence on the functioning of ecosystems in this scarcely studied climatic region.

T1  - Phosphorus Availability and Growth of Benthic Primary Producers in Littoral Lake Sediments: Are Differences Linked to Induced Bank Filtration?
AN  - 2550463563
AB  - Submerged macrophytes and periphyton are benthic primary producers that play an important role for several ecosystem functions of lakes. Their growth often depends on the availability of phosphorus (P) in sediments and overlying water. This P availability is assumed to potentially be affected by induced bank filtration (IBF), a cost-effective method for drinking water production. In this study, we tested whether littoral sediments sampled at sites with high and low influence of IBF in a temperate eutrophic lake used for bank filtration since more than 100 years affects periphyton and macrophyte growth. Sediments differed in aerobic desorbed water-soluble phosphorus (PH2O) and iron (Fe) content and the growth of macrophytes in sediments with a high impact of IBF was lower compared to sediments with low impact of IBF. We also found that P addition to the nutrient solution increased periphyton growth and that periphyton limited macrophyte growth. While these results point to a potential impact of IBF on P availability in sediments that can cascade to benthic primary producers, we could not prove mechanistic links between high rates of IBF and the lower macrophyte growth. Additional research to assure a sustainable application of this valuable drinking water production method is therefore needed.

T1  - An invasive alien bivalve apparently provides a novel food source for moulting and wintering benthic feeding sea ducks
AN  - 2546776778
AB  - Since its introduction from North America in the 1970s, the American razor clam Ensis leei (M. Huber, 2015) has successfully spread throughout North Sea coasts from Spain to Norway and the United Kingdom to the western Baltic. We investigated the distribution and abundance of this non-indigenous bivalve species as a potential novel food resource for common scoter Melanitta nigra (Linnaeus, 1758) along the eastern German North Sea coast. Highest densities of flightless moulting and wintering common scoters coincided with areas of high E. leei abundance. Other European studies showed common scoters extensively feed on E. leei. Even with these findings, it remains difficult to demonstrate convincingly that E. leei constitutes a major food source for common scoter in the German North Sea during their non-breeding season. However, our study suggests that E. leei has become an important prey item for internationally important concentrations of common scoters at large spatial scales.

T1  - Outbreak of avian botulism and its effect on waterbirds in the Wilderness Lakes, South Africa
AN  - 2315012716
AB  - Avian botulism has been reported in many areas worldwide, particularly in North America, where at times it has resulted in die-offs of hundreds of thousands of waterbirds. By contrast, there are few reported cases in wild waterbird communities in South Africa. Mass die-offs of waterbirds in the Wilderness Lakes, South Africa, were first observed in January 2015, raising concerns about the effect of disease on the status of waterbird communities in this Ramsar site. Surveys of bird carcasses were undertaken between 2015 and 2017. An estimated 1115 individuals from 23 species were affected, with sick individuals displaying symptoms of avian type C, C and D or E botulism. The highest mortality was amongst red-knobbed coot (  Fulica cristata  ), Cape shoveler (  Anas smithii  ) and yellow-billed duck (  Anas undulata  ), respectively comprising 60%, 18% and 9% of affected individuals. Cape shoveler was found to be particularly susceptible to the disease. Deaths occurred mainly during summer and autumn (November–April). No mortalities were recorded amongst 44 waterbird species, of which common moorhen (  Gallinula choropus  ), African purple swamphen (  Porphyrio madagascariensis  ) and reed cormorant (  Phalacrocorax africanus  ) are widespread and abundant. The reasons for the outbreaks remain elusive, as environmental changes characteristic of a botulism outbreak, notably a decline in water level and dissolved oxygen, did not differ substantially from earlier years when no disease outbreaks were observed. The role of fish, and in particular the recently introduced common carp (  Cyprinus carpio  ) in the progression of the disease, remains speculative, although worthy of investigation. The removal of carcasses for disease control should be continued.
Conservation implications: The long-term effect of repeated outbreaks of avian botulism on the abundance of susceptible waterbird species in the Wilderness Lakes is of concern. The previous regular high abundance of duck species, particularly yellow-billed duck and Cape shoveler, was the initial reason for the Wilderness Lakes being declared a Ramsar site. The effect of ongoing high disease-related mortalities may, in part, prevent these wetlands from continuing to regularly support globally significant populations of some waterbird species. The containment of the disease must be attempted by the regular collection and removal of dead birds and fish during the outbreak periods of November–June, and carcasses should be disposed of off-site. Further testing of affected individuals should be undertaken and the monitoring of environmental variables and affected individuals continued to improve the understanding of the drivers and progression of the disease.

T1  - A conservation palaeobiological approach to assess faunal response of threatened biota under natural and anthropogenic environmental change
AN  - 2241207155
AB  - Palaeoecological records are required to test ecological hypotheses necessary for conservation strategies as short-term observations can insufficiently capture natural variability and identify drivers of biotic change. Here, we demonstrate the importance of an integrated conservation palaeobiology approach when making validated decisions for conservation and mitigating action. Our model system is the Razim–Sinoie lake complex (RSL) in the Danube Delta (Black Sea coast, Romania), a dynamic coastal lake system hosting unique Pontocaspian mollusc species that are now severely under threat. The Pontocaspians refer to an endemic species group that evolved in the Black Sea and Caspian Sea basins under reduced salinity settings over the past few million years. The natural, pre-industrial RSL contained a salinity gradient from fresh to mesohaline (18 ppm) until human intervention reduced the inflow of mesohaline Black Sea water into the lake system. We reconstruct the evolution of the RSL over the past 2000 years from integrated sedimentary facies and faunal analyses based on 11 age-dated sediment cores and investigate the response of mollusc species and communities to those past environmental changes. Three species associations (“marine”, “Pontocaspian” and “freshwater”) exist and their spatio-temporal shifts through the system are documented. Variable salinity gradients developed, with marine settings (and faunas) dominating in the southern part of the system and freshwater conditions (and faunas) in the northern and western parts. Pontocaspian species have mostly occurred in the centre of the RSL within the marine–freshwater salinity gradient. Today, freshwater species dominate the entire system, and only a single Pontocaspian species (Monodacna colorata) is found alive. We show that the human-induced reduced marine influence in the system has been a major driver of the decline of the endemic Pontocaspian biota. It urges improved conservation action by re-establishing a salinity gradient in the lake system to preserve these unique species.

T1  - Miocene syn-rift lacustrine sediments in the Mecsek Mts. (SW Hungary)
AN  - 2163284534
AB  - The Pannonian Basin, a major back-arc basin in the Alpine–Carpathian orogenic belt, experienced its syn-rift phase during the Early–Middle Miocene. Studying coeval sediments can provide important information on the initiation of the extension. This paper investigates syn-rift deposits in the Mecsek Mts. in SW Hungary from a tectono-sedimentary aspect, using stratigraphy, palaeontology and structural observations to constrain palaeoenvironments and their tectonic background. Our study shows that in the Mecsek area the widespread Early Miocene fluvial sedimentation was not directly followed by inundation by the Central Paratethys sea, instead, a phase of lacustrine deposition in the Karpatian–Early Badenian (late Burdigalian–early Langhian) preceded the marine flooding. The lake sediments have a low-diversity but abundant, endemic mollusc and ostracod fauna, dominated by the bivalve Congeria boeckhi and the gastropod Ferebithynia vadászi. Identical faunas at various sites indicate that “Lake Mecsek” was a single water body, covering the present-day Mecsek Mts. and their surroundings. Wedge-shaped clastic bodies along faults, fault scarp breccias and semi-soft sediment deformations suggest that extensional tectonic activity related to the rifting of the Pannonian Basin played a role in lake basin formation. The accumulation of lakes was probably also enhanced by increased precipitation during the Miocene Climatic Optimum. The Central Paratethys flooded the area in the Badenian (Langhian) and deposited normal marine sediments over the lacustrine ones. Considering the fauna, the sedimentary succession, the structural background and evolution history, the Mecsek area seems to be part of the Illyrian bioprovince and related to the Dinaride Lake System.

T1  - Respiration and aeration by bioturbating Tubificidae alter biogeochemical processes in aquatic sediment
AN  - 2158432027
AB  - This study investigates the potential of bioturbating Tubificidae to alter biogeochemical processes by sediment aeration in order to enhance ecosystem development in eco-engineering projects. We introduced Tubificidae in three different densities (5000, 15,000, and 30,000 individuals m−2) in clay-rich sediment from lake Markermeer (The Netherlands). Redox potential, nutrients and major elements were measured from the water column and porewater at different depths. Mineral phase and redox transfers were chemically modelled and oxygen concentrations in bioturbated sediments for each density were mathematically predicted. The measured results of this experiment showed that Tubificidae oxygenated the upper 15 mm of the sediment. This resulted in decomposition of sedimentary organic matter with an associated sixfold increase in NH4 and NOx concentrations in the porewater and the water column. However, phosphorus concentrations were declining in the upper 16 mm, likely as a result of immobilization by pyrite oxidation and production of iron oxides. These bioturbation effects were highest in the treatment with an intermediate density of Tubificidae (15,000 worms m−2) as aeration effects in the treatment with the highest density of Tubificidae (30,000 worms m−2) was impeded by high respiration rates. Furthermore, with a two dimensional diffusion model, simulated effects of respiration and aeration on the oxygen concentration in the sediment suggest that the bioturbation effect is strongest at a density of 12,000 worms m−2. In ecological engineering projects where fast ecosystem development is important, introducing Tubificidae to aquatic sediments to optimal densities might enhance initial ecosystem development due to improved availability of nitrogen as nutrient.

T1  - Spatial Subsidies and Mortality of an Estuarine Copepod Revealed Using a Box Model
AN  - 2077257455
AB  - Mortality of planktonic populations is difficult to determine because assumptions of the methods are rarely met, more so in estuaries where tidal exchange ensures violation of the assumption of a closed or spatially uniform population. Estuarine plankton populations undergo losses through movement from productive regions, creating a corresponding subsidy to regions that are less productive. We estimated mortality rates of the copepod Pseudodiaptomus forbesi in the San Francisco Estuary using a vertical-life-table approach with a Bayesian estimation method, combined with estimates of spatial subsidies and losses using a spatial box model with salinity-based boundaries. Data came from a long-term monitoring program and from three sample sets for 1991–2007 and 2010–2012. A hydrodynamic model coupled with a particle-tracking model supplied exchange rates between boxes and from each box to several sinks. In situ mortality, i.e., mortality corrected for movement, was highly variable. In situ mortality of adults was high (means by box and sampling program 0.1–0.9 day−1) and appeared invariant with salinity or year. In situ mortality of nauplii and copepodites increased from fresh (~ 0) to brackish water (means 0.4–0.8 day−1), probably because of consumption by clams and predatory copepods in brackish water. High mortality in the low-salinity box was offset by a subsidy which increased after 1993, indicating an increase in mortality. Our results emphasize the importance of mortality and spatial subsidies in structuring populations. Mortality estimates of estuarine plankton are feasible with sufficient sampling to overcome high variability, provided adjustments are made to account for movement.

T1  - Thiamine deficiency in fishes: causes, consequences, and potential solutions
AN  - 2116258705
AB  - Thiamine deficiency complex (TDC) is a disorder resulting from the inability to acquire or retain thiamine (vitamin B1) and has been documented in organisms in aquatic ecosystems ranging from the Baltic Sea to the Laurentian Great Lakes. The biological mechanisms leading to TDC emergence may vary among systems, but in fishes, one common outcome is high mortality among early life stages. Here, we review the causes and consequences of thiamine deficiency in fishes and identify potential solutions. First, we examine the biochemical and physiological roles of thiamine in vertebrates and find that thiamine deficiency consistently results in impaired neurological function across diverse taxa. Next, we review natural producers of thiamine, which include bacteria, fungi, and plants, and suggest that thiamine is not currently limiting for most animal species inhabiting natural aquatic environments. A survey of historic occurrences of thiamine deficiency identifies consumption of a thiamine-degrading enzyme, thiaminase, as the primary explanation for low levels of thiamine in individuals and subsequent onset of TDC. Lastly, we review conservation and management strategies for TDC mitigation ranging from evolutionary rescue to managing for a diverse forage base. As recent evidence suggests occurrences of thiamine deficiency may be increasing in frequency, increased awareness and a better mechanistic understanding of the underlying causes associated with thiamine deficiency may help prevent further population declines.

T1  - Cyanobacteria consumption by cladocerans: a case study on facilitation
AN  - 2093012840
AB  - Eutrophic systems are stressful for zooplankton species, especially for small organisms (< 1000 μm) that are inefficient in consuming large colonies or filaments of cyanobacteria. Certain mechanisms, however, enable organisms to coexist in spite of the stress related to poor food quality or manageability of the diet. The present work suggests that coprophagy is recurrent behavior in cladocerans that may facilitate the survival and growth of some species in eutrophic systems. We chose three clones of Moina macrocopa that inhabit eutrophic systems. The species selected as possible facilitators were the cladocerans Simocephalus vetulus and Daphnia similis, and the ostracod Heterocypris incongruens, because they are cosmopolitan, have high rates of cyanobacterial filtration and in some cases coexist with Moina. The design used for the demographic experiments of the three clones of M. macrocopa was based on the source of nutrition and consisted of a control diet of Scenedesmus acutus (1 × 106 cells ml), a diet of undigested cyanobacteria (10 × 106 cells ml), and this same diet after digestion by D. similis, S. vetulus or H. incongruens. The excreta of the cladocerans was a deficient diet for Moina, whose populations decreased by more than 1 individual per day. On the contrary, fecal pellets of the ostracod were a diet that allowed Moina to have positive population growth (0.3 day−1). Our results help to explain the high densities achieved by cladocerans in eutrophic tropical water bodies where cyanobacterial blooms are normal.

T1  - The colonial ascidian <i>Diplosoma listerianum</i> enhances the occurrence of the hydrozoan <i>Obelia</i> sp. during early phases of succession
AN  - 2018638425
AB  - Recruitment patterns of sessile species often do not reflect the composition of the local propagule pool. This is, among other processes, attributed to the stimulation or inhibition of settlement by resident species. In an experimental study, we evaluated the effects of different densities of the ascidian Diplosoma listerianum on the settlement of the hydrozoan Obelia sp. For this, we monitored the cover of the dominant fouler Obelia sp. on vertically orientated PVC tiles, which were either bare or pre-seeded with two different densities (sparse or dense) of Diplosoma colonies, over the course of 8 weeks. The settlement tiles were deployed at two study sites in La Herradura Bay, Chile. The presence of D. listerianum enhanced the settlement or the growth or both of the colonial hydrozoan, but this effect disappeared within 4–8 weeks. Furthermore, we tested whether the initial enhancement of Obelia sp. by Diplosoma colonies goes back to the fact that larvae, which reject the ascidian tunic as a settlement substratum after a first contact, colonize nearby surfaces because of their limited mobility. However, we found no support for this assumption. We rather suggest that D. listerianum facilitated colonization indirectly by the accumulation of organic material in its vicinity and/or by its pumping activity. Initial resident-mediated enhancement of the hydrozoan was overridden by processes such as competition between later colonizers within the course of weeks and we could not detect any lasting effects of D. listerianum on the structure of the developing communities.

T1  - Drivers of Cyanobacterial Blooms in a Hypertrophic Lagoon
AN  - 2308088248
AB  - The Curonian Lagoon is Europe’s largest lagoon and one of the most seriously impacted by harmful blooms of cyanobacteria. Intensive studies over the past 20 years have allowed us to identify the major drivers determining the composition and spatial extent of hyperblooms in this system. We summarize and discuss the main outcomes of these studies and provide an updated, conceptual scheme of the multiple interactions between climatic and hydrologic factors, and their influence on internal and external processes that promote cyanobacterial blooms. Retrospective analysis of remote sensed images demonstrated the variability of blooms in terms of timing, extension and intensity, suggesting that they occur only under specific circumstances. Monthly analysis of nutrient loads and stoichiometry from the principal tributary (Nemunas River) revealed large interannual differences in the delivery of key elements, but summer months were always characterized by a strong N (and Si) limitation, that depresses diatoms and favors the dominance of cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria blooms result in transient (night-time) hypoxia, which stimulates the release of iron-bound P, producing a positive feedback for blooms of N-fixing cyanobacteria. Other biotic factors, such as dreissenid mussels, chironomid larvae, cyprinids and large bird colonies, may also promote P recycling during summer, but their role as drivers of cyanobacteria blooms is understudied.

T1  - Effects of a treated sewage effluent on behavioural traits in Diamesa cinerella and Daphnia magna
AN  - 2417690403
AB  - Recently, the use of Daphnia magna has been proposed in on-line and real-time biomonitoring programmes as an early warning system for evaluating the effluent quality of sewage treatment plants (STPs). These systems are based on recording behavioural changes in the test organism resulting from the stress caused by the effluents. Indeed, altered behavioural signals could be induced at sublethal concentrations that are significantly lower than the corresponding EC50. However, at present, it is unknown whether the sensitivity of D. magna can be representative of that of other aquatic organisms, particularly benthic macroinvertebrates. An experiment was designed to verify whether D. magna can be employed in biomonitoring programmes for STPs located in alpine areas as a surrogate for cold freshwater best-adapted species. The responses of survival and behaviour alteration to exposure to the effluent of the Tonale Pass plant (Trentino, Italian Alps, 46°N, 10°E; 1799 m a.s.l.) were compared in a laboratory population of D. magna and a wild population of the chironomid Diamesa cinerella. These larvae were collected from the Vermigliana stream 50 metres upstream of the effluent input. Both organisms were exposed for 24 and 48 hrs to the effluent as it is and to three dilutions (/10, /100, /1000). The mortality rate and behavioural responses (using video tracking systems) were recorded. No significant mortality or change in behaviour was observed in the two species when exposed to the undiluted effluent. Exposure to serial dilutions of the treated effluent did not affect the survival of either species but notably altered their behaviour at both exposure times (e.g., the time spent in activity in D. magna and the average speed of movement and the cumulative distance travelled in both), especially when exposed to the ten-times-diluted effluent. Overall, the findings of this study emphasize that even though D. magna and D. cinerella use different behavioural strategies to cope with adverse environmental conditions, their overall sensitivity to treated effluents is similar. Accordingly, the use of D. magna in biological early warning systems protocols seems to also be sufficiently protective for local, cold-adapted species of alpine freshwater ecosystems.

T1  - The influence of cyanobacteria blooms on the attenuation of nitrogen throughputs in a Baltic coastal lagoon
AN  - 2125116459
AB  - We combined a mass balance approach with measurements of air–water and sediment–water nitrogen (N) exchange to better understand the mechanisms attenuating N throughputs in a eutrophic coastal lagoon. We were particularly interested in how seasonal shifts in external versus internal N fluxes and the transition from diatom- to cyanobacteria- dominated phytoplankton communities influence N storage and loss to the atmosphere. We found that on an annual basis almost all of the N removed by the lagoon was due to sediment storage following the spring diatom bloom. This period was characterized by high riverine inputs of dissolved inorganic nitrogen, high rates of assimilatory conversion to particulate nitrogen (PN), and net accrual of N in sediments. By contrast, the larger summer bloom was associated with low sediment N storage, which we attribute in part to the presence of positively-buoyant cyanobacteria. Low settling rates during cyanobacteria blooms favored export of PN to the Baltic Sea over sediment accrual in the lagoon. In addition, summer dinitrogen (N2) fixation by cyanobacteria largely offset annual N2 losses via denitrification. These findings show that cyanobacteria blooms diminish N attenuation within the lagoon by altering the balance of N exchange with the atmosphere and by promoting export of particulate N over sediment burial.

T1  - Ecosystem services provision today and in the past: a comparative study in two Baltic lagoons
AN  - 2087791322
AB  - The European Biodiversity Strategy asks EU Member States for an assessment, mapping and valuing of Ecosystem Services (ES). While terrestrial ES concept is advanced and different tools are available, they are largely lacking for coastal and marine systems. We develop a stepwise methodological process to assess ES in coastal and marine systems which we name Marine Ecosystem Services Assessment Tool. We applied it to two large Baltic lagoons, the Szczecin and the Curonian Lagoons demonstrating a quantitative and qualitative assessment approach. Firstly, an initial status is defined reflecting, according to the European Water Framework Directive, a past situation when the ecosystems where in a so called good ecological state. In both Baltic lagoons, this refers to a situation around 1960. Secondly, a present state is defined, assessed and compared to the initial status. Increasing anthropogenic impacts in Szczecin Lagoon caused an overall decrease ecological status which may influence the system’s ability to provide services. Assessing ES changes semi-quantitatively via 39 indicators and 22 services, we show a decrease in provisioning and regulating and maintenance and an increase of cultural services’ provision. According to 15 expert valuations, the Curonian Lagoon displays no changes in provisioning but an increase in regulating and maintenance and cultural service provision. We discuss how these results can serve different marine management approaches and support different polices. Through our application we show how the tool can be used to assess ES changes over time and thus provide key information on sustainable use and ES for future generations.

T1  - Seasonal multi-annual trends in energy densities of the midges (genus <i>Chironomus</i>) in a Mediterranean temporary wetland (Natural Regional Reserve of the Isonzo River Mouth, Northeast Italy)
AN  - 2066876104
AB  - The present study is an attempt to deepen the knowledge about energy patterns in a detritus-based ecosystem located within a temporary wetland, where changes of water level can affect productivity, turnover of organic matter and the flow-through energy. Energy density was directly measured using an adiabatic bomb calorimeter in samples collected in autumn, spring and summer. Dipterans belonging to the genus Chironomus were the most common and representative invertebrates within the study area. Starting from these measures, a predictive model based on the relationship between energy density and percentage of dry weight was developed, validated and applied to build a multi-annual dataset. This model was used to investigate seasonal energy density trends on longer time-scale, in relation to physical and chemical features, weather conditions and decomposition dynamics. The used approach allowed to build a 3-year dataset and to identify clear seasonal trends; moreover, the application of the model highlighted patterns in relation to precipitation regime, decomposition dynamics and the effects due to variations of these features in the investigated temporary detritus-based system over a multi-annual scale.

T1  - Spatial and temporal trends of target organic and inorganic micropollutants in Lake Maggiore and Lake Lugano (Italian-Swiss water bodies): contamination in sediments and biota
AN  - 1992792668
AB  - DDx, PCBs, PBDEs, Hg, and As contamination in sediments and aquatic organisms of different trophic levels (zooplankton, mussel, fish) were analyzed in Lake Maggiore and Lake Lugano, two large deep perialpine lakes. In the period 2001–2015, we analyzed the spatial and temporal trends of the considered pollutants to detect potential contamination sources and to compare concentrations with Sediment Quality Guidelines (SQGs) or existing Quality Standards (QSs). DDx and Hg contamination deriving from past industrial activities in the Pallanza Basin still exceeded SQGs in sediments and QSs in fish, with potential risks for the ecosystem. Banned in Europe in 1985, PCBs showed low residual values, while recent PBDE peaks resulted in the exceedance of the QSs for biota in both lakes, probably due to current industrial activities. Arsenic mainly derives from geochemical origin. The analysis of the biomagnification of toxicants in a pelagic food chain in Lake Maggiore (zooplankton–fish) according to a stable isotope approach is also presented, according to both the Trophic Magnification Factor and the Trophic Level-adjusted BioMagnification Factor: the importance of seasonality and a Hg > DDx ≈ PBDEs biomagnification capacity were observed. Low PCB bioaccumulation was detected in biota, probably because equilibrium was not reached yet in young fish.

T1  - Biological characteristics of the rafting bivalve <i>Gaimardia trapesina</i> in the Southern Ocean
AN  - 2119139168
AB  - Rafting invertebrate species represent an important link for the dispersal and colonisation of islands in the Southern Ocean. They are sensitive to changes in hydrodynamics through effects on transport and food availability, particularly in the case of filter-feeding species. This gives them the potential to act as sentinels of environmental change. The rafting kelp-associated Gaimardia trapesina is one such species, widely distributed in the Southern Ocean. In 2015 and 2016, the size structure, diet, and distribution of G. trapesina were examined around the Sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Islands (PEI) to establish benchmark data and explore their potential use for monitoring long-term change. Gaimardia trapesina and its potential food sources were collected and analysed for size structure, attachment strength, and diet, using stable isotope and fatty acid analyses. The populations examined were dominated by relatively small individuals. The strength of attachment to kelp blades was low and the byssal threads showed high elasticity. The PEI lie in the path of the west–east flowing Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the highest abundances of G. trapesina were found on the downstream sides of both islands, while the species was absent from the western, upstream coasts. Both diet analyses and SIAR mixing models indicated that G. trapesina feeds on suspended particulate matter, while kelp particles contribute minimally to the diet. Considering the wide distribution of G. trapesina, its importance as food for birds and fish, and its sensitivity to environmental conditions, there is good potential to use this species as an indicator of environmental change in the Southern Ocean.

T1  - The Plant Alkaloid Camptothecin as a Novel Antifouling Compound for Marine Paints: Laboratory Bioassays and Field Trials
AN  - 2048816907
AB  - The extensive use of copper and booster biocides in antifouling (AF) paints has raised environmental concerns and the need to develop new AF agents. In the present study, 18 alkaloids derived from terrestrial plants were initially evaluated for AF activity using laboratory bioassays with the bryozoan Bugula neritina and the barnacle Balanus albicostatus. The results showed that 4 of the 18 alkaloids were effective in inhibiting larval settlement of B. neritina, with an EC50 range of 6.18 to 43.11 μM, and 15 of the 18 alkaloids inhibited larval settlement of B. albicostatus, with EC50 values ranging from 1.18 to 67.58 μM. Field trials that incorporated five alkaloids respectively into paints with 20% w/w indicated an in situ AF efficiency of evodiamine, strychnine, camptothecin (CPT), and cepharanthine, with the most potent compound being CPT, which also exhibited stronger AF efficiency than the commercial antifoulants cuprous oxide and zinc pyrithione in the field over a period of 12 months. Further field trials with different CPT concentrations (0.1 to 20% w/w) in the paints suggested a concentration-dependent AF performance in the natural environment, and the effective concentrations to significantly inhibit settlement of biofoulers in the field were ≥ 0.5% w/w (the efficiency of 0.5% w/w lasted for 2 months). Moreover, CPT toxicity against the crustacean Artemia salina, the planktonic microalgae Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Isochrysis galbana, was examined. The results showed that 24 h LC50 of CPT against A. salina was 20.75 μM, and 96 h EC50 (growth inhibition) values of CPT to P. tricornutum and I. galbana were 55.81 and 6.29 μM, respectively, indicating that CPT was comparatively less toxic than several commercial antifoulants previously reported. Our results suggest the novel potential application of CPT as an antifoulant.

T1  - Effects of inorganic anions on the photolysis of triclosan under UV irradiation
AN  - 2139171180
AB  - Triclosan is a widely used antimicrobial agent and may pose health risks to many aquatic organisms. Photodegradation is an important transformation pathway for triclosan, but studies on the effects of inorganic anions on photodegradation of triclosan are limited. In the present study, the single and combined effects of NO3−, Cl− and HCO3− on the photolysis of triclosan in aqueous solutions under UV irradiation was evaluated. The results showed that photodegradation of triclosan was inhibited by NO3− and promoted by HCO3−, while no significant effect was observed with Cl−. When Cl− was added to NO3−, no effect was observed, but the addition of Cl− hindered the promotion effect of HCO3−. The coexistence of NO3−, Cl− and HCO3− inhibited the photolysis of triclosan. These results showed the complex effects of inorganic anions in the photolysis of triclosan and provide useful information for an accurate ecological risk assessment of triclosan in natural waters. It will also help to develop appropriate treatment ways of triclosan.

T1  - Differences in the respiratory response to temperature and hypoxia across four life-stages of the intertidal porcelain crab <i>Petrolisthes laevigatus</i>
AN  - 2091560085
AB  - For aquatic breathers, hypoxia and warming can act synergistically causing a mismatch between oxygen supply (reduced by hypoxia) and oxygen demand (increased by warming). The vulnerability of these species to such interactive effects may differ during ontogeny due to differing gas exchange systems. This study examines respiratory responses to temperature and hypoxia across four life-stages of the intertidal porcelain crab Petrolisthes laevigatus. Eggs, megalopae, juveniles and adults were exposed to combinations of temperatures from 6 to 18 °C and oxygen tensions from 2 to 21 kPa. Metabolic rates differed strongly across life-stages which could be partly attributed to differences in body mass. However, eggs exhibited significantly lower metabolic rates than predicted for their body mass. For the other three stages, metabolic rates scaled with a mass exponent of 0.89. Mass scaling exponents were similar across all temperatures, but were significantly influenced by oxygen tension (the highest at 9 and 14 kPa, and the lowest at 2 kPa). Respiratory responses across gradients of oxygen tension were used to calculate the response to hypoxia, whereby eggs, megalopae and juveniles responded as oxyconformers and adults as oxyregulators. The thermal sensitivity of the metabolic rates (Q10) were dependent on the oxygen tension in megalopae, and also on the interaction between oxygen tension and temperature intervals in adults. Our results thus provide evidence on how the oxygen tension can modulate the mass dependence of metabolic rates and demonstrate changes in respiratory control from eggs to adults. In light of our results indicating that adults show a good capacity for maintaining metabolism independent of oxygen tension, our study highlights the importance of assessing responses to multiple stressors across different life-stages to determine how vulnerability to warming and hypoxia changes during development.

T1  - Biomonitoring of Trace Metals in the Keban Dam Reservoir (Turkey) Using Mussels (<i>Unio elongatulus eucirrus</i>) and Crayfish (<i>Astacus leptodactylus</i>)
AN  - 1983982552
AB  - Freshwater mussels and crayfish are commonly used as biomonitors of trace metals. In the present study, the concentrations of ten metals were determined in mussels (Unio elongatulus eucirrus) and crayfish (Astacus leptodactylus) collected from the Keban Dam Reservoir in Turkey. The significant spatial differences in concentrations of studied metals except As in mussels were not found. However, Co, Cr, Cu, and Zn concentrations in mussels and As, Co, Cu, Fe, Pb, and Zn concentrations in crayfish showed significant seasonal differences. As, Cd, and Mn levels in mussels were about nine times higher than those in crayfish. The concentrations of Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Zn, and inorganic As in crayfish and mussels were lower than maximum permissible levels. When compared with other biomonitoring studies using mussels and crayfish, high concentrations of As, Cd, Co, Cr, and Ni in mussels and Cr and Ni in crayfish were observed due to lithogenic sources and anthropogenic activities in the basin. Bioconcentration factor values of Fe, Mn, Cd, and Zn in mussels and Zn, Cu, Fe, and Co in crayfish were > 1000, which indicates that both U. e. eucirrus and A. leptodactylus have potential to bioaccumulate these metals. Therefore, attention should be paid to mussels and crayfish from ecological and human health perspective, because they are potential vectors of metals to higher trophic levels.

T1  - Multi-year succession of cyanobacteria blooms in a highland reservoir with changing nutrient status, Guizhou Province, China
AN  - 2417690648
AB  - Over the last 22 years significant phytoplankton changes in Hongfeng lake reservoir have been observed with multiple years of harmful cyanobacteria blooms (cHABs). Fish farming and other anthropogenic activities from 1994-2001 triggered the harmful blooms. Nine years after the cessation of aquaculture, a conversion from problematic species (Microcystis spp, Aphanizomenon flos-aquae) to the less problematic species P. limnetica and other associated non-cyanobacteria taxa was recorded. Through this period of change, trophic factors (bottom-up) were re-examined, and correlations between cHABs and selected environmental variables were observed. Higher temperatures, nutrients (TN, TP) and available light significantly favored the development of Microcystis spp blooms. With declining nutrient loads, and a decline in TP relative to TN there was a competitive shift from Microcystis summer blooms to the growth of Pseudanabaena limnetica and other non-cyanobacteria. Pseudanabaena limnetica was favored over Microcystis spp when temperatures were <20°C and TP was <0.03 mg L-1. The apparent species succession to P. limnetica was enhanced by a competitive advantage under varied light conditions. Multiple environmental and biotic conditions (not always nutrients) were driving cHABs. Although only a selected number of environmental variables were examined, the CCA analysis supports observations that temperature and nutrients were associated with the species shift. The replacement of cHABs with the growth of less toxic cyanobacteria like P. limnetica, and other algae creates an interesting scenario (new community condition) for the removal of problematic taxa in reservoir systems. Diverting or controlling blooms will have direct implications on water quality and economic remediation initiatives in reservoir and lake management.

T1  - Identification of potential recruitment bottlenecks in larval stages of the giant fan mussel <i>Pinna nobilis</i> using specific quantitative PCR
AN  - 2024255615
AB  - Pinna nobilis is an endangered species of fan mussel found along coastal Mediterranean waters requiring special attention for conservation. Populations are restricted in number, due to anthropogenic disturbances, disease, and in some areas, low rates of recruitment. To date, the difficulties associated with the identification of planktonic stages have prompted the use of benthic collectors as a proxy for quantifying larval supply, despite important information being lost regarding planktonic processes. We present evidence of spawning utilizing a qPCR assay developed for detecting genomic DNA of P. nobilis to enable specific identification of planktonic stages to augment knowledge of P. nobilis life history. In the Ebro Delta, Spain, it has been used to study what might be limiting their reproduction locally. We demonstrate the ability to differentiate DNA of P. nobilis from other bivalve mollusks and distinguish between fertilized and unfertilized eggs of P. nobilis, which may be a crucial point for understanding the low level of recruitment seen in this natural population. We also show evidence of larval presence during the expected spawning period, although abundance in positive samples were so low that they pose new questions about factors controlling the availability of planktonic stages of P. nobilis.

T1  - Freshwater mussel (Unionidae) shells document the decline of trace element pollution in the regional watersheds of Chicago (Illinois, USA)
AN  - 2015453431
AB  - The present study analyzed trace element concentrations from the shells of native freshwater mussels collected from the headwater tributaries of the Illinois River (USA). These analyses were conducted to determine whether (A) anthropogenic enrichment could be observed and (B) whether enrichment had decreased following the enactment of Clean Water Act legislation in the 1970s. Collections archived in museums allowed comparison of the pre-Columbian period, the mid-20th century, and the early 21st century. The element Cu was consistently elevated above pre-Columbian baselines, while the elements As, Cd, Fe, and Zn were elevated in some collections. Although higher than baseline, concentrations Zn consistently declined from the mid-20th century to modern times, although differences occurred at individual sites. There was evidence for food web influence: the element Mn was significantly negatively correlated to sediment primary productivity as indexed by shell δ13C and Cu was positively correlated to trophic position as reflected by shell δ15N. Zn correlated to stream order across all time periods. We conclude that a mixture of historic factors affecting pollution control and land use patterns in the watershed led to sometimes conflicting effects on trace element bioaccumulation in mussel shells.

T1  - Does aquatic invasive species removal benefit native fish? The response of gizzard shad (<i>Dorosoma cepedianum</i>) to commercial harvest of bighead carp (<i>Hypophthalmichthys nobilis</i>) and silver carp (<i>H. molitrix</i>)
AN  - 1964914705
AB  - Bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) and silver carp (H. molitrix), collectively known as Asian carp, are planktivorous fishes that have invaded aquatic ecosystems throughout the Mississippi River Basin of North America. Consequently, Asian carp management plans (including contractual harvest) have been implemented to prevent range expansion into vulnerable systems such as the Great Lakes. Asian carp harvest also provides an opportunity to assess if control efforts can benefit native fishes. To answer this question, 26 years of standardized electrofishing data were analyzed, focusing on gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum) body condition (Wr) and abundance (catch-per-unit-effort, CPUE) from the Illinois River (Illinois, USA). Gizzard shad data were categorized into pre-Asian carp establishment (1990–1999), after Asian carp establishment (2000–2009), and harvest (2010–2014) periods. Gizzard shad Wr and small gizzard shad CPUE decreased in the entire river after Asian carp invasion, and Wr and large gizzard shad CPUE rebounded where harvest occurred. Contrastingly, small gizzard CPUE has not yet exhibited a positive response to harvest. These mixed results indicate a time-lag may exist between management action and ecosystem response. Ultimately, Asian carp removal may be facilitating improvements in gizzard shad body condition (by increasing forage availability), which may portend a future gizzard shad population rebound.

T1  - Production of Calcium-Binding Proteins in Crassostrea virginica in Response to Increased Environmental CO2 Concentration
AN  - 2307799783
AB  - Biomineralization is the complex process by organisms produce protective and supportive structures. Employed by mollusks, biomineralization enables creation of external shells for protection against environmental stressors. The shell deposition mechanism is initiated in the early stages of development and is dependent upon the concentration and availability of calcium carbonate ions. Changes in concentrations of the critical ions required for shell formation can result in malformation of shells. As pCO2 concentrations in the atmosphere continue to increase, the oceans are becoming more acidified. This process, known as ocean acidification (OA), has demonstrated adverse effects on shell formation in calcifying organisms across taxa. Although OA is known to inhibit the shell deposition in mollusks, the impact of OA on the gene regulation of calcium deposition remains unknown. Here we show the responses of four calcium-binding protein genes, caltractin (cetn), calmodulin (calm), calreticulin (calr), and calnexin (canx), to CO2-derived OA using a Crassostrea virginica mantle cell (CvMC) culture model and a larval C. virginica model. These four genes were cloned from C. virginica and the three-dimensional structures of the proteins encoded by these four genes were fully characterized using homologue modeling methods. Although an acidified environment by increased atmospheric pCO2 (1000 ppm) did not result in significant effects on CvMC proliferation and apoptosis, lower environmental pH induced upregulations of all four calcium-binding protein genes in CvMCs. Similarly, increased pCO2 did not affect the growth of larval C. virginica in the early stages of development. However, elevated pCO2 concentrations enhanced the expression of these calcium-binding protein genes at the protein level. The four calcium-binding protein genes demonstrated responsive expression profiles to an acidified environment at both cellular and individual levels. Further investigation of these genes may provide insight into the molecular regulation of mollusk biomineralization under OA stress.

T1  - The effect of warming on mortality, metabolic rate, heat-shock protein response and gonad growth in thermally acclimated sea urchins (<i>Heliocidaris erythrogramma</i>)
AN  - 2035207183
AB  - Environmental temperature affects the physiology and fitness of ectotherms, an important consideration in a warming ocean. We investigated the effects of acclimation to increased temperature in the Australian sea urchin, Heliocidaris erythrogramma. After a gradual introduction to increasing temperature (1 °C 6 day−1), sea urchins were held for ~ 3 months in four treatments at three elevated temperatures (22, 24 and 26 °C) and the median annual temperature, 20 °C. The effect of elevated temperature on survival, metabolic rate, Q10, heat-shock protein (HSP70) expression, gonad index and gonad histology were examined. There was no detectable effect of temperature on metabolic rate for the 22 and 24 °C treatments, although survival decreased by 23% in the 24 °C treatment and there was an increase in mean HSP70 expression. At 26 °C, metabolic rate was lower than at 22 and 24 °C, but was similar to controls, indicating that metabolic depression may have occurred, whereas survival decreased by 31% and HSP70 expression increased threefold. It is clear that there is an active physiological response in urchins held at the highest temperatures. The deleterious effect of living at temperatures projected for the future indicates that the persistence of future populations of H. erythrogramma will depend on acclimation as habitat warming continues.

T1  - Size at first maturity of Brachidontes rodriguezii (d'Orbigny, 1846) from the South-western Atlantic Ocean
AN  - 2030158419
AB  - The size at first maturity of the bivalve Brachidontes rodriguezii was estimated in a population located in the northernmost limit of its distribution along Argentinean coast. Specimens were collected in two consecutive reproductive seasons from December 2011 to February 2012 and from December 2012 to February 2013. Individuals were evaluated using biometric and histological analyses of the gonads. This study intended to provide important information about the development of gonadal tissue according to shell length increase. Our results showed immature specimens lack gonads or exhibited groups of cells undergoing mitosis adjacent to the epithelium of the mantle and the tubules of the digestive gland. Male and female gonad development extended to mantle lobes and visceral mass as long as maturation occurred to reach sexual maturity. Using a logistic model our results showed that the size at which 50% of females were mature at a gonadal level was 7.05 mm in shell length; in males, 50% of the population were mature at 8.13 mm in shell length. The minimum shell length at which maturity was observed was 6.99 mm in shell length in females and 6.00 mm in shell length for males.

T1  - The release and regulation of rotifers: examining the predatory effects of invasive juvenile common and bighead carp
AN  - 1999425738
AB  - Ecosystem level effects of common (Cyprinus carpio) and bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) have generally focused on adult life stages. The objective of our mesocosm study was to investigate and contrast the roles of juvenile common and bighead carp in structuring planktonic invertebrate assemblages, with focus on rotifers. We examined whether predation by juvenile carp was indiscriminate or size-selective with respect to prey size. Furthermore, we examined how changes to large and small prey influenced the potential for compensatory increases of some taxa within prey assemblages. Both species of juvenile carp reduced large zooplankton taxa. However, rotifer responses were variable depending on the taxon and predator combination. Juvenile common carp enhanced abundance for Polyartha and Squatinella, but most taxa were unaffected. Juvenile bighead carp had a more varied effect on rotifer abundance, having no effect on most, reducing Keratella and enhancing Anuraeopsis. We also estimated net filtration volume of the zooplankton community for each of the treatments and found partial compensation in net filtration because of the increased abundance of a few rotifer taxa, but this reduction did not match the depletion of macrozooplankton. Rotifers that benefitted from the presence of fish predators likely responded positively because of reduced predation by mesopredators, because of their short generation times, and/or from reduced competition.

T1  - Acute and Chronic Effects of Three Pharmaceutical Drugs on the Tropical Freshwater Cladoceran <i>Ceriodaphnia silvestrii</i>
AN  - 2015659430
AB  - Among emerging contaminants, pharmaceuticals are one of the most relevant groups of substances found in aquatic environment, due to their universal use, specific physical-chemical properties, and mode of action in aquatic organisms at low concentrations. Considering the magnitude of concentrations and the considerable small amount of information about their potential ecotoxicological effects on wildlife (especially towards organisms from tropical areas), the present study intended to assess the acute and chronic effects of three pharmaceuticals (the analgesic acetaminophen, the anti-inflammatory diclofenac, and the antihypertensive propranolol) in the tropical crustacean species Ceriodaphnia silvestrii. Results of acute exposures showed a considerable variation in toxicity among pharmaceuticals: acetaminophen (EC50 = 40.3 mg L−1) < diclofenac (EC50 = 37.9 mg L−1) < propranolol (EC50 = 3.17 mg L−1), C. silvestrii being more sensitive to the drug propranolol. Data of chronic toxicity tests showed the occurrence of reproductive adverse effects, but also stimulatory phenomena. Propranolol caused a significant increase in fecundity for the concentrations up to 0.0313 mg L−1, and the rate of population increase was significantly augmented from the lower concentration tested. Considering these results and the wide distribution of C. silvestrii in tropical regions, we suggest the use of this species to be used as test organism in ecotoxicity assays performed in such areas, especially for biomonitoring and/or the determination of effects of pharmaceutical drugs.

T1  - Experimental tumbling of <i>Dreissena polymorpha</i>: implications for recognizing durophagous predation in the fossil record
AN  - 1994705400
AB  - Shell damage left by predators constitutes an important source of information on predator–prey interactions. However, recognition of the origins of shell damage can often be controversial, and needs to be assessed cautiously. More specifically, differentiation between predation- and abiotic-induced shell damage remains challenging. Here, we show the results of tumbling experiments using a bivalve species Dreissena polymorpha in order to determine rates and patterns of shell damage induced by physical forces in high-energy conditions. It is demonstrated that, in contrast to durophagous fish and crab predation, abiotic-induced fragmentation and damage are typically characterized by the presence of distinct abrasive scratches and wear scars on the surface of shell fragments. Furthermore, fragmented shells typically reveal a wide size distribution, and a different degree of sphericity and roundness resulting from abrasion. Importantly, large shell fragments commonly display smooth edges. These data suggest that durophagous predation, which typically induces fragmentation into large and angular shell fragments bearing no wear scars, can be reliably recognized both in present-day environments and in the fossil record.

T1  - Rapid expansion of the Asian clam <i>Corbicula fluminea</i> (O. F. Müller, 1774): a new alien species in the mollusk community of the Vistula
AN  - 2469835122
AB  - A new large population of the Asian clam Corbicula fluminea (O. F. Müller, 1774) was found within a reach (ca 210 km long) of one of the largest European rivers, the Vistula. The largest population and the largest individuals were found at the outlet of a channel collecting heated water from the cooling process at the Połaniec power station and adjacent parts of the river. In the northern part of the study area, bivalves occurred at the channel margins, in groyne fields, and in the shallows of sand banks or sandbars. The clams were less numerous in places where the river was regulated with straightened banks and stone ripraps. Twenty-five other taxa of mollusks were found altogether at the sampling stations where Corbicula was observed, including other non-indigenous mollusk species.

T1  - Water quality impacts of small-scale hydromodification in an urban stream in Connecticut, USA
AN  - 2023984492
AB  - IntroductionConstruction activities in and along urban streams increase the sediment input into surface waters, causing an overall decline in water quality and aquatic ecosystems. In this case study, we investigate the water quality impacts of local hydromodification in an urban stream (discharge 0.4 m3/s). At the site of interest, workers removed a stream crossing consisting of an embankment with culverts and replaced it with a small bridge (single span of 25 m) in an effort to improve flow capacity.MethodsWater samples were taken at four sites along the North Branch Park River in Connecticut, Northeastern United States. Turbidity and dissolved oxygen (DO) were measured in situ, and nitrate and total phosphorus (TP) were measured in the laboratory. Benthic macroinvertebrate samples were also collected and analyzed for taxon richness and Shannon-Weaver species diversity. Data were compared between upstream and downstream sites and before, during, and after hydromodification. We used one-way ANOVA combined with the post hoc Turkey test to derive statistical significance.ResultsDuring construction, turbidity increased temporarily by 60.9% [from 2.48 Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU) over ambient to 4.00 NTU]. Once construction was completed, DO increased locally from 11.0 to 13.0 mg/L. Benthic macroinvertebrate taxon richness and species diversity declined by 61.6 and 32.6% respectively, with no recovery observed in the year following construction. Water quality was only affected within 50 m downstream. Nitrate and TP concentrations were unaffected.ConclusionsSmall-scale hydromodification temporarily increased the turbidity as a result of increased sediment input, approaching the maximum level for clean water (5 NTU). Benthic macroinvertebrate communities declined in the immediate downstream vicinity of construction but are expected to recover soon given that turbidity recovered to pre-construction levels, and DO increased. These outcomes emphasize that environmental assessment is important not only for large-scale hydromodification but also for smaller scale stream modifications.

T1  - Signature of postglacial colonization on contemporary genetic structure and diversity of <i>Quadrula quadrula</i> (Bivalvia: Unionidae)
AN  - 2002402768
AB  - Contemporary species distributions and geographic patterns of genetic structure largely reflect pre-historic events, often with subsequent alterations from human influences. The geographic genetic structure of a relatively common and widespread unionid species, Quadrula quadrula, was investigated to reconstruct its postglacial history. Hypotheses regarding colonization routes of Q. quadrula into the Great Lakes basin after the most recent glacial retreat were tested. Samples were collected from Q. quadrula at sites spanning hypothesized glacial refugia and postglacial expansion routes in the Mississippi River drainage, including the Ohio and Missouri rivers, and the Great Lakes. Broad-scale phylogeography and population structure were assessed by sequencing a fragment of the mitochondrial CO1 gene and genotyping eight microsatellites. Results of analyses showed marked differences among the Great Lakes, Mississippi River, and Ohio River drainages, and suggested colonization of the Great Lakes basin from a Mississippian source. Populations showed patterns of isolation by distance: geographic and genetic distances were significantly correlated among Great Lakes populations based on colonization through the Chicago–Illinois outlet, but not when following the Wabash–Maumee outlet. All evidence indicates that postglacial colonization of the Great Lakes basin occurred almost exclusively through the Chicago–Illinois outlet, with subsequent expansion into the lower Great Lakes.

T1  - Toxicity, degradation and analysis of the herbicide atrazine
AN  - 2002034934
AB  - Excessive use of pesticides and herbicides is a major environmental and health concern worldwide. Atrazine, a synthetic triazine herbicide commonly used to control grassy and broadleaf weeds in crops, is a major pollutant of soil and water ecosystems. Atrazine modifies the growth, enzymatic processes and photosynthesis in plants. Atrazine exerts mutagenicity, genotoxicity, defective cell division, erroneous lipid synthesis and hormonal imbalance in aquatic fauna and nontarget animals. It has threatened the sustainability of agricultural soils due to detrimental effects on resident soil microbial communities. The detection of atrazine in soil and reservoir sites is usually made by IR spectroscopy, ELISA, HPLC, UPLC, LC–MS and GC–MS techniques. HPLC/LC–MS and GC–MS techniques are considered the most effective tools, having detection limits up to ppb levels in different matrices. Biodegradation of atrazine by microbial species is increasingly being recognized as an eco-friendly, economically feasible and sustainable bioremediation strategy. This review presents the toxicity, analytical techniques, abiotic degradation and microbial metabolism of atrazine.

T1  - Effect of ultra-sonication and its use with sodium hypochlorite as antifouling method against <i>Mytilus edulis</i> larvae and mussel
AN  - 1993733924
AB  - Biofouling is a stubborn problem in cooling systems where using raw water from lakes, rivers, and sea. The effect of ultrasound and its sequential application with sodium hypochlorite (chlorination) upon marine bivalve Mytilus edulis (blue mussel), a massive fouling organism, has been studied and discussed here. The results obtained from the work carried out have shown that 42 kHz ultrasound is better than 28 kHz in accordance with veliger larvae mortality. The 42 kHz ultrasound has enhanced the mortality rate of veliger larvae than only free-residual chlorination up to 99%. On the other side, the 14-mm size mussel was less resistance than 25-mm size mussel to 42 kHz ultrasonication, among the studied two sizes (14 and 25 mm) of the blue mussel. Lethal time (100%) have decreased by 1–12% used for the sequential action of 42 kHz ultrasonic followed by free-residual chlorination compare with only free-residual chlorination treatment. The obtained results are put forward that the application of ultra-sonication before chlorination can reduce the mussel extinct time up to 12%. Obviously, this result will provide a possible use of ultra-sonication with famous chlorination antifouling treatment and eventually can decrease the chlorine exposure time and dose. It could discharge low chlorine by-products that may provide an environment friendly way.

T1  - The red macroalga <i>Gracilaria verrucosa</i> in co-culture with the Mediterranean mussels <i>Mytilus galloprovincialis</i>: productivity and nutrient removal performance
AN  - 1993164795
AB  - The feasibility of integrating seaweed cultivation with mussel culture in Bizerte lagoon (north Tunisia) was investigated during 1 year, in order to exploit mussel excretion nutrients as resource input and to reduce the risk of eutrophication. In parallel, to evaluate nutrients’ biofiltering efficiency and uptake rates of the agarophyte Gracilaria verrucosa, growth and nutrient removal from mussel culture water were investigated. In the laboratory, seaweed/mussel co-culture experiments were compared to mussel monoculture systems. The results showed that nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in monoculture were significantly higher than those in co-culture treatments. Algal growth rate, thallus nutrient contents, and mussel mortality were different between all treatments. The mussel/seaweed biomass ratio of 1:0.28 (treatment 1) was convenient for efficient nutrient uptake and best seaweed growth. Field cultivation trials showed that G. verrucosa grew well in bivalve culturing farm in Bizerte lagoon at a maximum growth rate of 4.45% day−1 attained in spring season. The mean nitrogen content in dry thalli cultured in co-culture with mussel in Bizerte lagoon was 4.19 ± 0.81%. Results indicate that G. verrucosa can efficiently absorb the nutrients from mussel in Bizerte lagoon and can be associated with local mussel farms, mitigating eutrophication, and eventually, increasing economic incomes of farmers.

T1  - Paralarvae of <i>Octopus vulgaris</i> Type II are stenohaline conformers: relationship to field distribution and dispersal
AN  - 1978150984
AB  - The degree of euryhalinity of cephalopod planktonic paralarvae potentially affects the dispersal capacity and distributional range of species. Herein, we tested the hypothesis that O. vulgaris Type II paralarvae would show some tolerance to seawater dilution, evaluated from integrated field and laboratory experiments. Paralarvae were collected from zooplankton samples (salinities of 30.3–32.6), in the Paraná Bay Estuarine Complex (PBEC), Southern Brazil. In the laboratory, they were exposed to salinities of 28, 30, 33, 35 (control), and 37, from 15 min to 24 h. Survival ranged from 60 to 83%, 73–100%, and 100% at salinity of 28, 30, and 33–37, respectively. Body fluid osmolality (BFO), body water content (BWC), and ninhydrin-positive substances (NPS, amino acids) were quantified at salinities of 33, 35, and 37 (with 100% survival). BFO was always isosmotic to the external medium. BWC and the high NPS concentration remained unchanged in all salinities. Thus, these paralarvae tolerate some deviation from seawater salinity, displaying osmoconforming behavior, maintain body hydration, and show high ability of tissue volume/water regulation in short periods of time. Presumably, this physiological capacity of paralarvae might be one factor allowing their dispersal and survival along environments with moderate deviations from seawater salinity.

T1  - Microscopy versus automated imaging flow cytometry for detecting and identifying rare zooplankton
AN  - 1975945188
AB  - Many zooplankton surveys underestimate species richness owing to difficulties in detecting rare species. This problem is particularly acute for studies designed to detect non-indigenous species (NIS) when their abundance is low. Our goal was to test the difference in detection efficiency between traditional microscopy and image analysis (i.e., FlowCAM). We hypothesized that detection of rare species should become easier as they become abundant in a sample, if they are morphologically distinct, or if counting effort increased. We spiked different densities of Cladocera into zooplankton samples from Lake Ontario to simulate rarity, and assessed detection rate. Our results indicated that there was a positive relationship between the probability of finding at least one spiked NIS and its abundance, distinctiveness, and counting effort employed. FlowCAM processed more subsamples, though morphologically similar taxa were distinguished more readily with microscopy. The expected probability for detecting one individual spiked into a sample with ~ 8000 individuals (300 counted) was 3.60%, though observed values were considerably lower using both classical microscopy (4.58 × 10−3 to 1.00%) and FlowCAM (0.10 to 3.00%). Our experiments highlight that many plankton ecologists use subsample counts too low to detect rare native species and NIS, resulting in low species richness estimates and false negatives.

T1  - Does Mussel Farming Promote Cost Savings and Equity in Reaching Nutrient Targets for the Baltic Sea?
AN  - 2582943405
AB  - Mussel farming has been suggested as a low-cost option for reducing nutrient content in eutrophied waters. This study examines whether mussel farming contributes to reductions in total nutrient abatement cost and increases in equity for achieving nutrient load reduction targets to the Baltic Sea under different international policy regimes (cost-effective, country targets set by the Baltic Sea Action Plan (BSAP), and nutrient-trading markets). A cost-minimizing model is used to calculate the cost savings, and the analytical results show that mussel farming is a cost-effective option only when the marginal abatement cost is lower than for other abatement measures. The numerical cost-minimizing model of the Baltic Sea indicates that the largest abatement cost reductions from introduction mussel farming, approximately 3.5 billion SEK (9.36 SEK = 1 Euro), are obtained under the cost-effective and nutrient-trading systems. Equity, as measured by abatement cost in relation to affordability in terms of gross domestic product, is improved by mussel farming under the cost-effective regime but reduced under the BSAP country targets and nutrient-trading regimes.

T1  - The colonial ascidian <i>Diplosoma listerianum</i> enhances the occurrence of the hydrozoan <i>Obelia</i> sp. during early phases of succession
AN  - 2575269216
AB  - Recruitment patterns of sessile species often do not reflect the composition of the local propagule pool. This is, among other processes, attributed to the stimulation or inhibition of settlement by resident species. In an experimental study, we evaluated the effects of different densities of the ascidian Diplosoma listerianum on the settlement of the hydrozoan Obelia sp. For this, we monitored the cover of the dominant fouler Obelia sp. on vertically orientated PVC tiles, which were either bare or pre-seeded with two different densities (sparse or dense) of Diplosoma colonies, over the course of 8 weeks. The settlement tiles were deployed at two study sites in La Herradura Bay, Chile. The presence of D. listerianum enhanced the settlement or the growth or both of the colonial hydrozoan, but this effect disappeared within 4–8 weeks. Furthermore, we tested whether the initial enhancement of Obelia sp. by Diplosoma colonies goes back to the fact that larvae, which reject the ascidian tunic as a settlement substratum after a first contact, colonize nearby surfaces because of their limited mobility. However, we found no support for this assumption. We rather suggest that D. listerianum facilitated colonization indirectly by the accumulation of organic material in its vicinity and/or by its pumping activity. Initial resident-mediated enhancement of the hydrozoan was overridden by processes such as competition between later colonizers within the course of weeks and we could not detect any lasting effects of D. listerianum on the structure of the developing communities.

T1  - Temporal variation of secondary migrations potential: concept of temporal windows in four commercial bivalve species
AN  - 2196539159
AB  - Post-settlement dispersal potential of four commercial bivalve species (Mytilus edulis, Pecten maximus, Venus verrucosa and Ruditapes philippinarum) were studied through the assessment of recruits' sinking velocities by using a sinking velocity tube of five meters height. In parallel, dynamics of shear stress were monitored for five months on a tidal habitat characterized by the presence and the dispersal of the four species. By coupling both datasets we propose first theoretical estimates of temporal windows of secondary migrations. These experiments revealed interspecific differences in migration potential relate to shell shapes and behaviour, especially to secretion of byssal threads. The sensitivity to passive and active post-settlement migrations seems to rely on the synchronisation between the arrival on the sediment, the tidal regime (spring tide, neap tide), but also the rate of growth of the recruits. The present study confirms that patterns of secondary migrations of bivalve recruits result from a close physical-biological coupling involving benthic boundary layer (BBL) hydrodynamics and shell morphology as well as eco-ethological responses to environmental conditions but clearly modulated by the growth dynamics until a threshold size when drifting is no longer possible.

T1  - A Half-century of Research on Free-living Amoebae (1965–2017): Review of Biogeographic, Ecological and Physiological Studies
AN  - 2187382425
AB  - This is a review of over 400 published research papers on free-living, non-testate amoebae during the approximate last half century (1965-2017) particularly focusing on three topics: Biogeography, Ecology, and Physiology. These topics were identified because of the substantial attention given to them during the course of the last half century, and due to their potential importance in issues of local and global expanse, such as: aquatic and terrestrial stability of habitats, ecosystem processes, biogeochemistry and climate change, and the role of eukaryotic microbes generally in ecosystem services. Moreover, there are close epistemological and thematic ties among the three topics, making a synthesis of the published research more systematic and productive. The number of reviewed publications for each of the three individual topics is presented to illustrate the trends in publication frequencies during the historical period of analysis. Overall, the number of total publications reviewed varied somewhat between 1965 and early 2000 (generally less than 10 per year), but increased to well over 10 per year after 2000. The number of Biogeography and Ecology studies identified in the online citations increased substantially after the mid 1990s, while studies focusing on Physiology were relatively more abundant in the first decade (1965-1974) and less were identified in the 1985 to 2004 period. Citations to the literature are listed in tables for each of the three topics for convenience in retrieving references to specific aspects, and representative examples of the cited research in the tables are reviewed in the text under subheads dedicated to each of the three topics. Biogeographic studies largely focused on the geographic distribution and localized patterns of occurrence of amoebae, with more recent studies incorporating more attention to likely correlates with environmental and biotic factors in the distribution and community composition of amoebae. Ecological studies reviewed in the later decades tended to focus more on community dynamics, the effects of environmental variables on communities (including climate-related topics), a trend toward more physiological ecology studies, combined field-based and experimental studies, and incorporation of newer methodologies such as molecular genetics. In general, physiology studies in the first decades of the review tended to focus on topics of cell physiology such as basic biochemistry, enzyme assays, mechanisms of cell division and development, encystment, and motility. Later studies examined broader topics such as osmoregulation, nutrition, fine structure evidence of cellular changes during the life cycle (including encystment and excystment), and issues related to asexual and sexual reproduction, with increasing substantial evidence of evolutionary patterns and phylogenetics based on molecular evidence. A final section on Conclusions and Recommendations summarizes the findings and presents some potentially productive approaches to future research studies on Amoebozoa within the three designated topics of analysis.

T1  - Littoral chironomids of a large Alpine lake: spatial variation and variables supporting diversity
AN  - 2161920004
AB  - Chironomidae are a major group of littoral secondary producers whose spatial changes in assemblage structures are shaped by diverse variables. Using their subfossil remains, we aimed at disentangling the relative impact of environmental, topographic, littoral occupation and hydrodynamic variables on the littoral assemblages as well as identifying taxa and sites of primary importance for the β-diversity in a large lake (Lake Bourget). A redundancy analysis coupled with a variance partitioning indicated that 22 % of the assemblage variability was explained by slope, carbonate concentration and littoral occupation. A non-negligible fraction of non-separable variance among these variables likely highlights the topographic constraint on anthropogenic development and environmental conditions. Taxonomic turnover overwhelmingly (93.2 %) dominated the assemblage changes indicating site-specific taxonomic composition. The taxa contribution to β-diversity was positively correlated with their mean abundances. The local abundances were either positively or negatively correlated with local contribution of sites to β-diversity (LCBD) providing evidence for different contributions of taxa to β-diversity. A couple of taxa (i.e. Cricotopus spp., Microtendipes sp. and Cladotanytarsus sp.) and sites (i.e. LB57, LB31, LB2) clearly supported the major variations of β-diversity and are therefore identified as being of primary importance regarding conservation programs. Both LCBD variations and taxa spatial autocorrelations suggest that chironomid assemblages were the most variable at a spatial-scale ranging from 500 m to 1 km, characterizing the spatial successions of littoral contexts. These results illustrate the need for considering short spatial scales to reveal the extent of the benthic diversity in the littoral areas of large lakes.
Les Chironomidae constituent un groupe important de producteurs secondaires littoraux dont les changements spatiaux dans les structures d'assemblage sont façonnés par diverses variables. À partir de leurs restes subfossiles, le rôle relatif des variables environnementales, topographiques, de l'occupation du littoral et de l'hydrodynamisme sur les assemblages littoraux a été recherché avant d'identifier les taxons et les sites de première importance pour la diversité β dans un grand lac alpin (le lac du Bourget). Une analyse de redondance couplée à un partitionnement de la variance a indiqué que 22 % de la variabilité des assemblages était expliquée par la pente, la concentration de carbonate et l'occupation du littoral. Une fraction non négligeable de la variance non séparable parmi ces variables met probablement en évidence l'effet de la contrainte topographique sur le développement anthropique et les conditions environnementales. Le renouvellement taxonomique a dominé les changements d'assemblage (93,2 %) mettant en évidence des compositions taxonomiques spécifiques pour les différents sites. La contribution des taxons à la diversité β était positivement corrélée à leur abondance moyenne, tandis que les abondances locales étaient corrélées positivement ou négativement à la contribution locale des sites à la diversité β (LCBD), suggérant différentes contributions des taxons à la diversité β. Un ensemble de taxons (Cricotopus spp., Microtendipes sp. et Cladotanytarsus sp.) et des sites (LB57, LB31, LB2) supportaient clairement les variations majeures de la diversité β et sont donc identifiés comme étant d'intérêt prioritaire pour des actions de conservation. Les variations de LCBD et les autocorrélations spatiales des taxons suggèrent que les assemblages de chironomes étaient les plus variables à une échelle spatiale allant de 500 m à 1 km, caractérisant les successions spatiales des contextes littoraux. Ces résultats illustrent la nécessité d'envisager de courtes échelles spatiales pour appréhender la diversité benthique dans les zones littorales des grands lacs alpins.

TT  - Ressonância do Spin Eletrônico (ESR) na detecção de poluição aquática através da relação parasito-hospedeiro
AN  - 2137404237
AB  - Aquatic environmental pollution due to negative human activities remains a major problem. Bioindicators that primarily describe the total concentration of the respective pollutant are very useful tools to aid in the chemical analysis of water in order to obtain knowledge about the levels of pollutants in the environment. This study therefore used Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy (ESR) to detect the presence of transition metals (copper, iron and manganese) and possible radicals present in samples of Neoechinorhynchus curemai and its host tissues Prochilodus lineatus, as well in water and sediment of the Batalha River, at the same sample site where fish were collected. Spectral analysis of samples showed the presence of three metals (Cu2+, Fe3+ and Mn2+), in addition to nitric oxide (NO) and humic acid (HA). Quantification of the elements in the samples was possible only for Cu detected in the spectrum of parasites, which was equivalent to 2 ppm. ESR proved to be efficient in the detection of transition-metal ions (Cu2+, Fe3+ and Mn2+), in addition to NO and HA. However, the low concentration values of these compounds in P. lineatus tissues (liver, muscle and intestine) and in the water and sediment samples collected did not allow their quantification, as they were below the limit of detection. It can be concluded that N. curemai had the capacity to accumulate these ions, especially copper.Alternate abstract:A poluição de ambientes aquáticos em decorrência de atividades antrópicas negativas permanece sendo um grande problema. Para se obter conhecimento acerca dos níveis biológicos de poluentes disponíveis no meio, os bioindicadores tornam-se uma ferramenta muito útil no auxílio das análises químicas da água que primariamente descrevem a total concentração do respectivo poluente. Nesse contexto, o objetivo desse trabalho foi o de empregar a técnica de Espectroscopia de Ressonância do Spin Eletrônico (ESR) para detectar a presença de poluentes, diretamente em espécimes de Neoechinorhynchus curemai e nos tecidos do seu hospedeiro Prochilodus lineatus, assim também como na água e sedimento do rio Batalha, no mesmo ponto onde os peixes foram coletados. A análise do espectro das amostras identificou a presença de três metais (Cu2+, Fe3+ e Mn2+), além do óxido nítrico (NO) e do ácido húmico (AH). A quantificação dos elementos nas amostras só foi possível para o Cu, detectado no espectro dos parasitos, que foi de 2ppm. A ESR se mostrou eficiente na detecção de íons metálicos de transição (Cu2+, Fe3+ e Mn2+), além do NO e do AH. Entretanto, a baixa concentração desses compostos nos tecidos (fígado, músculo e intestino) de P. lineatus. não possibilitaram sua quantificação, já que as concentrações dos mesmos estão abaixo do limite de detecção do aparelho. É possível concluir que N. curemai teve a capacidade de acumular esses íons, especialmente cobre.

T1  - Barriers to Effective Eutrophication Governance: A Comparison of the Baltic Sea and North American Great Lakes
AN  - 2040901278
AB  - The Baltic Sea and the North American Great Lakes are two transboundary watersheds that are at risk from similar environmental stressors including nutrient enrichment, hydrologic modifications, chemicals of emerging concern, and the overarching stressor of climate change. Although located in different geographical regions of the world, both watersheds are governed in a multilevel governance setting with many layers of decision makers including global, national, governmental, regional, municipal, and community levels. Despite governance innovations, such as the Helsinki Convention in 1974 and the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement in 1972 and their updated versions, both transboundary waters are under increasing stress from eutrophication. There are provisions in both the Helsinki Convention and the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement for nutrient abatement measures, yet algal blooms abound in both waters, especially after precipitation events. This paper looks at the governance processes in both transboundary ecosystems, with the aim of highlighting governance barriers to eutrophication mitigation using four analytical lenses. A comparison of the two systems and the governance barriers shows that similar and unique challenges are faced in both regions, and the choice of analytical lens affects the perception of barriers and implementation actions. This is useful for policymakers in planning intervention strategies to tackle the stressor of nutrient enrichment in both regions.

T1  - Pelagic zonation of water quality and phytoplankton in the Great Lakes
AN  - 1981649812
AB  - Analysis of aquatic ecosystem data collected from large water bodies must consider spatial variations. A suite of pelagic survey stations exists for the Laurentian Great Lakes, but little is known about their redundancy. We present a strategy to delineate the lakes into zones based on water quality and phytoplankton biovolume. Water samples were collected from 72 sites in two seasons (spring and summer) from 2007 to 2010 in all five lakes. Integrated samples were analyzed for phytoplankton biovolume and nine water quality parameters. We conducted cluster analysis, principal components analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling methods for water quality and phytoplankton taxon-specific biovolume for the Great Lakes basin and for each lake separately. There were significant lake-to-lake differences, and based on lake-specific analyses, Lake Superior, Lake Michigan and Lake Erie were each divided into three zones; Lake Huron and Lake Ontario were each grouped into two zones. The zones identified by water quality and phytoplankton provide an understanding of spatial distributions for evaluating monitoring data.

T1  - Variability of the reproductive cycle in estuarine and coastal populations of the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis Lmk. from the SE Bay of Biscay (Basque Country)
AN  - 2623490736
AB  - Mussel commercial production depends on wild populations to obtain the seed. Therefore, any new farming initiative needs deep knowledge on reproductive cycle of native mussel populations. The reproductive cycle of Mytilus galloprovincialis Lmk. from five sites, three estuarine and two coastal, along the coast of the Basque Country were assessed using gonad index and stereology over 2 consecutive years (2010 and 2011). Sex ratios, developmental stages of gonads , as well as reserve tissue cycle were analyzed. The onset of gametogenesis was observed from winter to spring, with spawning occurring from spring till summer. A resting phase followed with an increase in reserve tissues (adipogranular cells) was observed in fall. Mussels stayed ripe during winter until favorable environmental conditions were met in spring. Differences in reproductive cycles were found among populations, and also, year-to-year variability was observed within each population. In two of the studied sites asynchrony in the timing of spawning was observed between genders. These timing differences, however, did not prevent mussels at those sites from reproducing successfully. The Bidasoa estuary points to the potential of such studied sites for becoming the main source of wild mussel spats for future expected commercial mussel farming in the Basque Country. To ensure year-to-year maximum reproductive output, however, wild mussels harvest should be avoided from spring to the end of summer in this region.

T1  - Coupling a bio-accumulator organism and MALDI-TOF MS: an early warning detection system for microcystins in water bodies
AN  - 1969750313
AB  - Microcystins produced by freshwater cyanobacteria pose serious threats to human health and are a growing problem in drinking water supplies worldwide. Toxin detection and identification in water reservoirs when cyanobacterial density is still low is a key step to predict harmful algal blooms and to allow the safe use of the resource. For this purpose, developing sensitive and rapid methods of analysis is crucial. Adopting a strategy that couples the use of a filter-feeder organism (Unio elongatulus, Pfeiffer 1825 (Bivalvia: Unionidae)) with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization—time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) technology, effective microcystin detection was achieved. The performances of MALDI-TOF MS, high-liquid-performance chromatography with diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) test were compared. The results obtained in this study suggest that the exploitation of an efficient bio-accumulator organism, coupled with a rapid and sensitive analytical method, can be a very useful strategy in monitoring programs for early and prompt risk management.

T1  - Modeling spring-summer phytoplankton bloom in Lake Michigan with and without riverine nutrient loading
AN  - 1947363269
AB  - There were two phytoplankton blooms captured by remote sensing in Lake Michigan in 1998, one from March to May, and one during June. In this paper, those phytoplankton blooms were simulated by a coupled physical–biological model, driven by observed meteorological forcing in 1998. The model reasonably reproduced the lake currents. The biological model results, with and without riverine nutrient loading, were compared with the remote sensing data. A 3-month-long donut-like phytoplankton bloom that appeared in southern Lake Michigan was reasonably well simulated only when riverine input was included, indicating the importance of riverine nutrient input for supporting the growth of phytoplankton in Lake Michigan. The model with riverine input also captured a second event-driven phytoplankton bloom during June with weaker magnitude that occurred in mid-south Lake Michigan, which lasted for about 20 days. The major reason for the weaker bloom in June was that vertical mixing in the hydrodynamic model was too weak (leading to a mixed-layer depth of 20 m) to bring the bottom nutrient-rich water up to the epilimnion. High chlorophyll concentration that persisted in Green Bay for almost a year was simulated with less intensity.

T1  - Measuring Stable Carbon and Nitrogen Isotopes in Mytilus galloprovincialis to Elucidate the Sources of Organic Matter in Three Different Nearshore Marine Environments
AN  - 1938839096
AB  - Rumolo, P.; Carannante, M.; Gherardi, S.; Tamburrino, S.; Vallefuoco, M.; Migliaccio, R.; D Argenzio, C., and Barra, M., 2017. Measuring stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes in Mytilus galloprovincialis to elucidate the sources of organic matter in three different nearshore marine environments. Journal ofCoastal Research, 33(5), 1172-1181. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. 
Stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes (S13C and S15N) in mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) were used to elucidate the sources of sedimentary organic matter in nearshore marine environments at three different locations: (1) Naples harbour, (2) Formia harbour, and (3) Gulf of Gaeta (Tyrrhenian Sea). The sites showed different environmental characteristics, with the latter one considered as the control site, because it hosts "mussel farms" cultivated for human food. Significant differences in both S13C and S15N were found at Naples harbour compared to the other two sites. In particular, the lowest S15N (>4%o) and the highest S13C (>1.6%) values were found in mussels collected in Naples harbour, while similar S13C and S15N values were detected in Formia harbour and in the Gulf of Gaeta. As shown by a Stable Isotope Analysis in R (SIAR)-mixing model, 15N-depleted and 13C-enriched mussels highlight the influence of anthropogenic inputs on this area, particularly of organic fertilizers.

T1  - Comparative analyses of physiological assays and chlorophyll a variable fluorescence parameters: investigating the importance of phosphorus availability in oligotrophic and eutrophic freshwater systems
AN  - 1931970710
AB  - Diverse measurements of nutrient status indicators were used to test the severity of physiological phosphorus (P) limitation of phytoplankton among lake systems ranging from oligotrophic to eutrophic, based on P and chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations. Metabolic assays and particulate nutrient ratios were used to estimate nutrient status at sites located in Lake Erie, Lake Ontario and Lake Huron. Variable fluorescence ratios (F v/F m), relative electron transport rates and their response to irradiance were measured by the pulse-amplitude-modulated fluorometer. Under summer stratified conditions, P deficiency was strongest in the oligotrophic sites and nitrogen (N) status indicators and Chl a variable parameters revealed no severe N deficiency. Nutrient amendment assays showed positive associations with P additions and Chl a fluorescence parameters at P-deficient sites. In the most oligotrophic sites, N additions revealed a modest increase only detected by the Chl a fluorescence parameters. Phytoplankton communities were also associated with nutrient status, where chrysophytes and cryptophytes were important in P-deficient sites and cyanobacteria, phyrrophyta, and diatoms were prevalent in nutrient-rich sites. The results confirmed that Chl a fluorescence parameters can reveal P deficiency and indicate its severity among the range of trophic status in aquatic systems.

T1  - Freshwater anostracan, Branchinella kugenumaensis, as a potential controlling consumer species on toxic cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa
AN  - 1931963512
AB  - To evaluate the potential of Branchinella kugenumaensis for cyanobacterial bloom control relative to Daphnia, we conducted several feeding experiments on microcystin-free and microcystin-containing unicellular strains of Microcystis aeruginosa and colonial forms of Microcystis using B. kugenumaensis and Daphnia magna in a laboratory. Branchinella kugenumaensis showed higher filtration rates than those of D. magna in all treatments. In particular, the microcystin-containing unicellular strain supported the highest filtration rates of B. kugenumaensis among treatments. Daphnia magna reduced colonies less than 75 [mu]m in length, whereas B. kugenumaensis could graze colonies less than 100 [mu]m. The middle-sized group of B. kugenumaensis had a higher filtration rate than the small and large sized groups in a continuous feeding experiment for 4 days. In survival experiments, survivorships were not different between the two species, whereas ages at the beginning of the experiments affected their survival time. Our results showed that B. kugenumaensis grazed on toxic and colonial cyanobacteria at relatively high rates, indicating that locally abundant grazers like Branchinella may offer a better potential for bloom control than Daphnia.

T1  - Organochlorine contaminants in wild mink from the lower Great Lakes basin, Canada, 1998-2006
AN  - 1930222803
AB  - Organochlorine contaminants were measured in livers of wild mink (Neovison vison) trapped in the lower Great Lakes basin from 1998 to 2006. To assess exposure and potential risk in mink feeding on Great Lakes biota, concentrations of contaminants were compared in mink trapped within 7.8 km of the shoreline as well as at inland sites (i.e., 8-40 km). Overall, significant spatial variation in mean hepatic concentrations of sum PCBs and seven other organochlorines was found in mink from 13 Great Lakes sites, many of which are within the Great Lakes Areas of Concern. Mean sum PCB concentrations, on a lipid weight basis, ranged from 2 [mu]g/g in mink from inland Lake Ontario sites to 44 [mu]g/g in mink from western Lake Erie. Concentrations of other organochlorines in mink were generally low. Mink from western Lake Erie had the highest mean cumulative organochlorine burdens dominated largely by PCBs. A significant age effect was found with 1-year-old mink having significantly higher PCB burdens than mink less than 1 year in age. With respect to published PCB threshold effect concentrations, some mink exceeded those associated with effects on reproduction and survival as well as the presence of jaw lesions. This was most consistently found in western Lake Erie where the health of populations of wild mink may be adversely affected and where no mink 2 years of age or older were collected.

T1  - Water research in Germany: from the reconstruction of the Roman Rhine to a risk assessment for aquatic neophytes
AN  - 1966295625
AB  - Germany does not only have a long tradition in water research, but a very active community of scientists and practitioners working on a vast range of “water topics.” This thematic issue, which was initiated by four water-related research associations (German Hydrological Society; German Limnological Society; Hydrological Sciences Commission within German Water Association; Working Group Hydrology within German Geographical Society), is a testimony of both the quality and diversity of the water research currently undertaken by Germany’s scientific community. Key topics include hydrology and hydromorphology; water quality; aquatic and riparian ecosystems; water in agriculture and forestry; and water management and supply. The manuscripts contained in this thematic issue do not only cover a period of more than two millennia, but also address all types of water resources and a multitude of both established and newly developed methods that help us to better understand the processes governing the hydrological cycle, aquatic ecosystems and the management and operation of various water infrastructures.

T1  - Predation impact of the notothenioid fish Trematomus bernacchii on the size structure of the scallop Adamussium colbecki in Terra Nova Bay (Ross Sea, Antarctica)
AN  - 1925068316
AB  - Biotic interactions are particularly relevant in stable environments, such as the High Antarctic areas. Among them, predation has a key role in structuring community and population variables, including size-frequency distribution. This study aims to quantify the impact of predation by the notothenioid fish Trematomus bernacchii on the Antarctic scallop Adamussium colbecki-size distribution. We developed a model of this impact that estimates the size distribution of the preyed scallop population, taking into account for the predator-size distribution, sex structure, and daily consumption. Comparing this size distribution of the preyed A. colbecki with the living populations at Terra Nova Bay (Ross Sea, Antarctica), we were able to detect a relevant impact of fish predation. Fish-size frequency resulted to be the major factor shaping prey-size structure, with significant differences between predation by males and females. Our findings, given the key role of the two species in the littoral ecosystem of Terra Nova Bay (Antarctic Special Protected Area 161), fall into the framework of ecosystem management of High Antarctic coastal areas, particularly in the actual context of climate change, and increasing anthropogenic impact.

T1  - Neutral Evolution and Dispersal Limitation Produce Biogeographic Patterns in Microcystis aeruginosa Populations of Lake Systems
AN  - 1915752334
AB  - Molecular observations reveal substantial biogeographic patterns of cyanobacteria within systems of connected lakes. An important question is the relative role of environmental selection and neutral processes in the biogeography of these systems. Here, we quantify the effect of genetic drift and dispersal limitation by simulating individual cyanobacteria cells using an agent-based model (ABM). In the model, cells grow (divide), die, and migrate between lakes. Each cell has a full genome that is subject to neutral mutation (i.e., the growth rate is independent of the genome). The model is verified by simulating simplified lake systems, for which theoretical solutions are available. Then, it is used to simulate the biogeography of the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa in a number of real systems, including the Great Lakes, Klamath River, Yahara River, and Chattahoochee River. Model output is analyzed using standard bioinformatics tools (BLAST, MAFFT). The emergent patterns of nucleotide divergence between lakes are dynamic, including gradual increases due to accumulation of mutations and abrupt changes due to population takeovers by migrant cells (coalescence events). The model predicted nucleotide divergence is heterogeneous within systems, and for weakly connected lakes, it can be substantial. For example, Lakes Superior and Michigan are predicted to have an average genomic nucleotide divergence of 8200 bp or 0.14%. The divergence between more strongly connected lakes is much lower. Our results provide a quantitative baseline for future biogeography studies. They show that dispersal limitation can be an important factor in microbe biogeography, which is contrary to the common belief, and could affect how a system responds to environmental change.

T1  - Passive transport of a benthic bivalve (Corbicula fluminea) in large lakes: implications for deepwater establishment of invasive species
AN  - 1912907495
AB  - Once introduced into a new ecosystem, the benthic bivalve Corbicula fluminea (Asian clam) will spread rapidly through both active and passive transport. In Lake Tahoe, CA-NV, where C. fluminea was introduced in 2002, populations have been found to thrive at shallow depths, where individuals are reproductive, but also at deeper depths where the only possible mechanism of population growth is downslope recruitment. This study used a variety of field and laboratory measurements to parameterize a hydrodynamic drag force model to predict passive clam transport under varying flow conditions. Laboratory results for clam shells ranging from 5 to 20 mm in length under flow conditions from 10 to 25 cm s-1 were used to solve for drag and lift coefficients. Field results are presented during weak stratification (September 2010-March 2011) when cooler water temperatures acted as a potential stressor for buried individuals to rise to the surface and be subjected to flows from which they would otherwise be isolated. During episodic wind events throughout this time period, peak horizontal water velocities of 25 cm s-1 and peak vertical (downwards) water velocities of 4 cm s-1 were measured in which all size classes of adult C. fluminea were potentially transported. Using a fundamental hydrodynamic drag force model approach to predict passive transport, the results of this study can be extended to other bivalve species for a wide array of flow conditions.

T1  - LAKE ERIE'S WESTERN BASIN 10
AN  - 2717341688
AB  - The western-basin's morphology, hydrology, and biota are distinctive within Lake Erie. The western basin is separated from the rest of the lake by a series of islands and shoals running from west of Huron OH to Point Pelee, Ontario. It is the shallowest of Lake Erie's three basins with an average depth of 7.4 m and a maximum depth of 18.9 m and constitutes 13% of the lake's surface area and 5% of its volume. Over 90% of the lake's annual water input enters from tributaries to this basin. Southern areas of the western basin are strongly influenced by nutrient-rich waters from the Maumee River and the Sandusky River, whereas the northern portion is largely influenced by nutrient-poor waters from Lake Huron and Lake St. Clair via the Detroit River. Here, Drouin and Soper explore changes in the western-basin food web and assess progress toward the Lake Erie Committee's fish community objectives.

T1  - Spatiotemporal distributions of intestinal helminths in female lesser scaup Aythya affinis during spring migration from the upper Midwest, USA
AN  - 1904768354
AB  - We examined the associations between intestinal helminth infracommunity structure and infection parameters and the age, size, and year and region of collection of 130 female lesser scaup (Aythya affinis) during their 2014-2015 spring migrations through the upper Midwest, USA. We identified a total of 647,174 individual helminths from 40 taxa, including 20 trematodes, 14 cestodes, 4 nematodes and 2 acanthocephalans parasitizing lesser scaup within the study area. Lesser scaup were each infected with 2-23 helminth taxa. One digenean, Plenosoma minimum, is reported for the first time in lesser scaup and in the Midwest. Mean trematode abundance and total helminth abundance was significantly less in 2015 than 2014, and we suspect that colder weather late in 2015 impacted the intermediate host fauna and caused the observed differences. Brillouin's species diversity of helminths was greatest in the northernmost region of the study area, which coincides with the range of a non-indigenous snail that indirectly causes annual mortality events of lesser scaup. While host age and size were not determined to be influential factors of helminth infracommunity structure, non-parametric ordination and permutational analysis of co-variance revealed that year and region of collection explained differences in helminth infracommunities. Our results suggest that spatiotemporal variations play an important role in the structure of intestinal helminth infracommunities found in migrating lesser scaup hosts, and may therefore impact host ability to build endogenous reserves at certain stopover locations in the Midwest.

T1  - Bioavailability of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) to short-neck clam (Paphia undulata) from sediment matrices in mudflat ecosystem of the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia
AN  - 1901421028
AB  - The bioaccumulation and bioavailability of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were characterized in sediment and Paphia undulata (short-neck clam) from six mudflat areas in the west coasts of Peninsular Malaysia. The concentrations of total PAHs varied from 357.1 to 6257.1 and 179.9 ± 7.6 to 1657.5 ± 53.9 ng g -1 dry weight in sediment and short-neck clam samples, respectively. PAHs can be classified as moderate to very high level of pollution in sediments and moderate to high level of pollution in short-neck clams. The diagnostic ratios of individual PAHs and principal component analysis indicate both petrogenic and pyrogenic sources with significant dominance of pyrogenic source. The first PAHs biota-sediment accumulation factors and relative biota-sediment accumulation factors data for short-neck clam were obtained in this study, indicating a preferential accumulation of lower molecular weight PAHs. Evaluation of PAH levels in sediments and short-neck clams indicates that short-neck clam could be introduced as a good biomonitor in mudflats. The results also demonstrated that under environmental conditions, the sedimentary load of hydrocarbons appears to be one of the factors controlling their bioavailability to biota.

T1  - Characterization and speciation of mercury in mosses and lichens from the high-altitude Tibetan Plateau
AN  - 1901420963
AB  - The accumulation and species of mercury (Hg) in mosses and lichens collected from high-altitude Tibetan Plateau were studied. The altitudes of the sampling sites spanned from 1983 to 5147 m, and a total of 130 mosses and 52 lichens were analyzed. The total mercury (THg) contents in mosses and lichens were in the ranges of 13.1-273.0 and 20.2-345.9 ng/g, respectively. The average ratios of methylmercury (MeHg) in THg in mosses and lichens were 2.4 % (0.3-11.1 %) and 2.7 % (0.4-9.6 %), respectively, which were higher than those values reported in other regions. The contents of THg in both mosses and lichens were not correlated with the THg in soils (p > 0.05). The lipid contents displayed a significantly positive correlation with concentrations of MeHg in mosses (r = 0.461, p < 0.01, n = 90), but not in lichens. The correlations between Hg contents in mosses and the altitudes, latitudes and longitudes of sampling sites indicated the mountain trapping and spatial deposition of Hg in the Tibetan Plateau.

T1  - High-Resolution Melting of 18S rDNA sequences (18S-HRM) for discrimination of bivalve's species at early juvenile stage: application to a spat survey
AN  - 1899629036
AB  - It is particularly difficult to identify bivalve species at early development stages (larvae and spat) by morphological examination. Targeting genetic marker commonly used for species identification, we developed a cheap and user friendly tool for bivalve identification through High-Resolution Melting (HRM) analysis. Based on the polymorphism of the nuclear 18S ribosomal RNA gene among 11 orders of bivalve, the 18S-HRM method allowed discriminating species of the Ostreida, Mytilida and Pectinida orders. In this study, this method proved to be a very sensitive tool able to authenticate one species that differed by only one mutation from another one. We applied the method by identifying bivalve species in spat collections from different benthic substrates moored at subtidal and intertidal areas in euhaline conditions. This field survey showed that the settlement of the invasive species Crassostrea gigas was limited vertically to intertidal substrates. In conclusion, the 18S-HRM analysis is a fast, closed-tube method with high resolution and cost effectiveness, and is thus a good alternative method to identify bivalve species. This HRM assay can by applied for species identification of bivalves in the context of ecological management as well as food traceability for bivalves with economical interests.

T1  - Sensitivity to selected contaminants in a biological early warning system using Anodonta woodiana (Mollusca)
AN  - 1892114135
AB  - Several early warning systems for the monitoring of water quality are based on the assessment of valve opening/closing in bivalves. Tests were conducted to assess the sensitivity of the mussel Anodonta woodiana, installed on the Mosselmonitor, to seven contaminants and evaluate the usefulness of these sensors for detecting pollution events in the Po River (Italy). Mussels were exposed for 30 min to increasing concentrations of chromium (range 0.01-5 mg/L); arsenic (range 0.05-2.5 mg/L); sodium dodecyl sulphate SDS (range 0.25-50 mg/L); phenol (range 0.1-100 mg/L); oxadiazon (range 0.001-5 mg/L); trichloroethylene (range 0.01-100 mg/L); and crude oil (range 0.5-50 mg/L). Treatment with the highest concentration of SDS elicited two types of alarm response. In a second set of tests, the bivalves were exposed for 6 h to a selected concentration of each chemical. Only SDS led to a dramatic alteration of valve opening, resulting in alarms. This system would have limited applications for monitoring drinking water influent.

T1  - Size effect on the mineralogy and chemistry of Mytilus trossulus shells from the southern Baltic Sea: implications for environmental monitoring
AN  - 1882358162
AB  - Mussels have the ability to control biomineral production and chemical composition, producing shells with a range of functions. In addition to biological control, the environment also seems to influence the process of biomineralization; thus, shells can be used as archives of ambient water parameters during the calcium carbonate deposition. Past and present environmental conditions are recorded in the shells in the form of various proxies including Mg/Ca or Sr/Ca ratios. For such proxies to be accurate and robust, the influence of biological effects including the size of studied organism must be examined and eliminated or minimized, so that the environmental signal can be efficiently extracted. This study considers mineralogy and elemental composition of shells representing four size classes of Mytilus trossulus from the Baltic Sea. Obtained results suggest that mineralogy and chemical composition change throughout the shell development due to most likely a combination of environmental and biological factors. The content of aragonite increases with increasing shell size, while the bulk concentrations of Na, Cd, Cu, U, V, Zn and Pb were found to decrease with increasing height of the shells. Therefore, using mussels for environmental monitoring requires analysis of individuals in the same size range.

T1  - Pathways of macroinvertebrate invasions in the Ob River basin (West Siberia)
AN  - 1881958318
AB  - Water bodies of West Siberia mainly belong to the Ob River basin, which is not connected to other basins by shipping canals. The relative isolation of the basin predetermined the major role of industrial fisheries and aquarium trade in alien invertebrate transfer into the basin reservoirs. About 60% of the alien species were introduced into water bodies of West Siberia through industrial fisheries, and about 40% through aquarium fisheries. This paper is the first attempt to supplement a list of alien aquatic invertebrates from the Ob River basin. The data on the spread of 21 known non-indigenous species of invertebrates in this area are available. It should be noted that 7 species were deliberately introduced to enhance food reserves for fish, 8 were released by aquarists, 5 were inadvertently released during fish and forage organism introduction, and 1 (a crayfish) was imported for human consumption. For species with a known establishment period, there was a prolonged lag time in cases of both intentional and inadvertent introduction. The high invasion rate in the relatively isolated water bodies of the Ob River basin is comparable to that in Europe; hence, establishment of control over fishery-induced movement of alien invertebrates is required.

T1  - Variability of Mya arenaria growth along an environmental gradient in the Plum Island Sound estuary, Massachusetts, USA
AN  - 1876035457
AB  - An understanding of the environmental factors that determine how clam growth varies in space and time improves effective mariculture and shellfish management. We examined the importance of temperature, salinity and chlorophyll-a in controlling the spatial pattern of Mya arenaria growth, the commercially important soft-shell clam, in the Plum Island Sound estuary in northeastern Massachusetts, USA. We collected clams (>5.08 cm) monthly during the April to November growing season from which we determined growth rate, maximum size (L-infinity), and time to reach a harvestable size. We also surveyed selected sites along the estuary to estimate the relationship between clam size and weight. We collected environmental data along the estuary, and our data were complemented with data collected and maintained by the Plum Island ecosystems long-term ecological research project. Clams reached harvestable size fastest and had the greatest L-infinity at the most oceanic site (Yacht Club) in the estuary. Clams had the smallest L-infinity and were slowest to reach the harvestable size at the least oceanic site (Railroad Meander). The spatial patterns of clam growth were best explained by a positive distribution of salinity. Salinity significantly accounted for 95 % of the spatial variation of clam growth in the estuary. Snow melt in spring increases freshwater input to the estuary and results in the lowest spring salinity during a year, and this explained the upper estuary limit of clam distribution. IPCC-projected climate change will cause sea-level rise and increasing precipitation in the northeastern USA, which will modify the spatial pattern of salinity in the region's estuaries. Our research therefore suggests that future management of M. arenaria, an important economic resource for the local economy, should be concerned with the changes of salinity distribution under climate and land-use change.

T1  - Delineating the role of calcium in shell formation and elemental composition of Corbicula fluminea (Bivalvia)
AN  - 1868236750
AB  - Calcium is one of the major constituents of bivalve shells. Other element impurities potentially record physical and chemical changes of the ambient environment during growth. It is commonly assumed that Ca2+ and other divalent ions may share the same transport mechanisms because of similar ionic radii and electrochemical properties. However, little effort has been devoted to bolstering this hypothesis. Here, we investigated the effects of Ca2+ on shell formation and element composition of the freshwater bivalve, Corbicula fluminea. Our results showed that increasing aqueous Ca2+ levels from 3 to 6 mM did not facilitate shell production. However, the amounts of Mn, Cu, and Pb incorporated into the shells significantly decreased, indicating the potential competition with Ca2+ in the same transport pathways. Furthermore, blocking the Ca2+ channels by lanthanum and Verapamil significantly reduced Mn, Cu, Zn, and Pb incorporation into the shells, and Mn/Cashell and Cu/Cashell decreased simultaneously when inhibiting the Ca2+-ATPase by ruthenium red. However, the amounts of Mg, Sr, and Ba incorporated into the shells were virtually unaffected, implying that intracellular Ca2+ transport mechanisms are not responsible for their incorporation into the shells. These findings help decipher underlying mechanisms responsible for the element partitioning between the ambient water and the shells.

T1  - The effects of environment on Arctica islandica shell formation and architecture
AN  - 1881095247
AB  - Mollusks record valuable information in their hard parts that reflect ambient environmental conditions. For this reason, shells can serve as excellent archives to reconstruct past climate and environmental variability. However, animal physiology and biomineralization, which are often poorly understood, can make the decoding of environmental signals a challenging task. Many of the routinely used shell-based proxies are sensitive to multiple different environmental and physiological variables. Therefore, the identification and interpretation of individual environmental signals (e.g., water temperature) often is particularly difficult. Additional proxies not influenced by multiple environmental variables or animal physiology would be a great asset in the field of paleoclimatology. The aim of this study is to investigate the potential use of structural properties of Arctica islandica shells as an environmental proxy. A total of 11 specimens were analyzed to study if changes of the microstructural organization of this marine bivalve are related to environmental conditions. In order to limit the interference of multiple parameters, the samples were cultured under controlled conditions. Three specimens presented here were grown at two different water temperatures (10 and 15°C) for multiple weeks and exposed only to ambient food conditions. An additional eight specimens were reared under three different dietary regimes. Shell material was analyzed with two techniques; (1) confocal Raman microscopy (CRM) was used to quantify changes of the orientation of microstructural units and pigment distribution, and (2) scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to detect changes in microstructural organization. Our results indicate that A. islandica microstructure is not sensitive to changes in the food source and, likely, shell pigment are not altered by diet. However, seawater temperature had a statistically significant effect on the orientation of the biomineral. Although additional work is required, the results presented here suggest that the crystallographic orientation of biomineral units of A. islandica may serve as an alternative and independent proxy for seawater temperature.

T1  - Applications and perspectives on microfluidic technologies in ships and marine engineering: a review
AN  - 1870661945
AB  - More than 71% of the earth's surface area is occupied by ocean, and the shipping has become one of the most common forms of transportation. There are many applications for rapid on-site detection in ships and marine engineering in general. However, owing to the limited space and environmental conditions, large-scale laboratory equipment cannot be utilized on ships and offline examination methods cannot meet the needs for rapid detection and analysis of problems. Microfluidic technologies provide an excellent platform where various biological and chemical reactions can be completed on very small microfluidic chips. The combination of microfluidic technologies and ship and marine engineering will have important theoretical significance and practical value. These applications mainly include ballast water analysis, lubricating oil analysis, monitoring oil spill, ship exhaust gas detection and ship sewage detection. Therefore, in this paper, we have summarized the current applications of microfluidic technologies in ships and marine engineering and suggested prospects for the potential research directions in the future.

T1  - The Hydra regeneration assay reveals ecological risks in running waters: a new proposal to detect environmental teratogenic threats
AN  - 1870191320
AB  - The regenerative ability of Hydra vulgaris was tested as potential biomarker for the development of a new eco-toxicological index. The test is based on the regeneration rate and the aberration frequency of the columna (body and adhesive foot) after separation from head and tentacles by a bistoury. Particularly, 45 columnae were submerged in the rearing solution (that is Hydra medium) to have control, and 285 in potential contaminated waters to have treatments, collected from 19 sites along 10 rivers in central Italy. ANCOVA and chi-square tests were used to compare values from each site to a laboratory control. Subsequently the values on regeneration rate and aberration frequency were inserted in a double entry matrix, where the match of the two entries in the matrix provides the score of the proposed Teratogenic Risk Index (TRI). Each score corresponded to one of the 5 teratogenic risk classes, to which a risk level was associated: from 1 (no risk) to 5 (very high risk). On the whole, 32% of the studied sites were classified as no teratogenic risk while the remaining showed a variable risk level from low to very high. This study proposed for the first time an early warning system to detect the presence of teratogens in running waters, providing a rapid and cost-effective evaluation method. Therefore, TRI may contribute to initiate adequate measures to manage riverine habitats, and to monitor the running water teratogenic status. Specifically, this index may provide the opportunity to identify the disturbance sources and then to drive the decisions, together with competent authorities, on the catchment and landscape management and on the possible use of waters for urban, agricultural, and industrial activities, since they may show significant effects on the human health.

T1  - Microelectrophoretic study of environmentally induced DNA damage in fish and its use for early toxicity screening of freshwater bodies
AN  - 1869494488
AB  - This study investigates the potential of the comet and micronucleus assays of fish DNA as a means of screening the toxicity of aquatic environments. Catla catla and Cirrhinus mrigala collected from the River Chenab in Pakistan were used as a case study for the application of comet and micronucleus techniques. Comet and micronucleus assays were used to compare DNA damage in C. catla and C. mrigala collected from polluted areas of the River Chenab and farmed fish. Atomic absorption spectrophotometry showed an acute level of toxicity from Cd, Cu, Mn, Zn, Pb, Cr, Sn, and Hg in river water. Comet assay showed significant (p < 0.05) DNA damage in C. catla representing 17.33 ± 2.42, 11.53 ± 2.14, and 14.17% DNA in the comet tail, averaged from three sites of the polluted area of the river. Tail moment was observed as 10.06 ± 2.71, 3.11 ± 0.74, and 14.70 ± 1.89, while olive moment was 8.85 ± 1.84, 3.83 ± 0.76, and 7.11 ± 0.73, respectively. Highly significant (p < 0.01) damage was reported in C. mrigala as 37.29 ± 2.51, 34.96 ± 2.53, and 38.80 ± 2.42% DNA in comet tail, tail moment was 23.48 ± 3.90, 19.78 ± 4.26, and 14.30 ± 1.82, and olive moment was 16.22 ± 2.04, 13.83 ± 1.96, and10.99 ± 0.90. Significant (p < 0.05) differences were observed in genotoxicity between farmed and polluted area fish. Micronucleus assay showed a similar picture of significant difference in respect to single and double micronucleus induction: i.e., 23.20 ± 4.19 and 2.80 ± 1.07[per thousand] in C. catla and 44.80 ± 3.73 and 06.20 ± 0.97[per thousand], respectively, in C. mrigala. Nuclear abnormalities were found as 6.00 ± 0.84 and 09.60 ± 1.72/thousand cells, respectively, in both species. The results of this study suggest that these novel fish DNA damage assays can be used as an expedient toxicity screening for aquatic environments.

T1  - Rare but large bivalves alter benthic respiration and nutrient recycling in riverine sediments
AN  - 1869487107
AB  - (ProQuest: ... denotes formulae and/or non-USASCII text omitted; see image)

              
Bioturbation studies have generally analyzed small and abundant organisms while the contribution to the benthic metabolism by rare, large macrofauna has received little attention. We hypothesize that large, sporadic bivalves may represent a hot spot for benthic processes due to a combination of direct and indirect effects as their metabolic and bioturbation activities. Intact riverine sediments with and without individuals of the bivalve Sinanodonta woodiana were collected in a reach with transparent water, where the occurrence of the mollusk was clearly visible. The bivalve metabolism and its effects on sedimentary fluxes of dissolved gas and nutrients were measured via laboratory incubations of intact cores under controlled conditions. S. woodiana contributed significantly to O2 and TCO2 benthic fluxes through its respiration and to ......, SRP and SiO2 regeneration via its excretion. The bivalve significantly stimulated also microbial denitrification and determined a large efflux of CH4, likely due a combination of bioturbation and biodeposition activities or to anaerobic metabolism within the mollusk gut. This study demonstrates that a few, large individuals of this bivalve produce significant effects on aerobic and anaerobic benthic metabolism and nutrient mobilization. Random sediment sampling in turbid waters seldom catches these important effects due to low densities of large fauna.

T1  - Toxicology of arsenic in fish and aquatic systems
AN  - 1868242017
AB  - Arsenic (As) is found in waters such as seawater, warm springs, groundwater, rivers, and lakes. In aquatic environments, As occurs as a mixture of arsenate and arsenite, with arsenate usually predominating. The unrestricted application of As pesticides, industrial activities, and mining operations has led to the global occurrence of soluble As above permissible levels of 0.010 mg/L. Continuous exposure of freshwater organisms including fish to low concentrations of As results in bioaccumulation, notably in liver and kidney. As a consequence As induces hyperglycemia, depletion of enzymatic activities, various acute and chronic toxicity, and immune system dysfunction. Here we review arsenic chemistry, the occurrence of arsenic in aquatic system, the transformation and metabolism of arsenic; arsenic bioaccumulation and bioconcentration; behavioral changes; and acute and other effects such as biochemical, immunotoxic, and cytogenotoxic effects on fish.

T1  - Quantitative assessment of the reliability of chironomid remains in paleoecology: effects of count density and sample size
AN  - 1865255958
AB  - Random distributions for a wide range (1-100,000) of chironomid head capsules (HC) were simulated on a 1-m2 surface. The number of HC found in circular surfaces equivalent to standard core diameters (90 and 63 mm) was estimated 1000 times, over the range of tested densities. For each number of HC found in the samples, the range of simulated densities was estimated using a threshold probability (p > 0.95). This enabled us to develop equations to infer HC density from sample counts. Because of the threshold probability for comparable sample counts, the equations yield higher estimated densities under a random distribution than for a regular distribution. The probability of sampling at least one HC was >0.95 for densities of 900 HC m-2 for the 90-mm core and 1400 HC m-2 for the 63-mm core. For a specific sample count, the range of actual densities was ~10 times higher for the 63-mm core than the 90-mm core. Comparison with field larval densities revealed that most densities were too low to be suitable for annually resolved reconstruction of a quantitative signal, using current corer sizes, although a large number of populations can support sub-decadal analyses. Nonetheless, some lakes exhibit population sizes large enough to reconstruct robust quantitative estimates of past chironomid abundances. This work provides guidance to reconstruct species dynamics and fine-scale time series analyses in paleoecology.

T1  - Comparative analysis of biofilm community on different coloured substrata in relation to mussel settlement
AN  - 1858054267
AB  - Mussels are typical macrofouling organisms in the world. In this study, the interaction between the settlement of Mytilus coruscus plantigrades and bacterial community on coloured substrata was determined. Bacterial communities in biofilms developed on seven coloured substrata were analysed by Illumina Miseq sequencing. The mussel settlement response to coloured substrata with no biofilms was also examined. Flavobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria were the first, second and third most dominant groups in seven biofilm samples. The results suggest that the inducing activities of these biofilms on plantigrade settlement varied with coloured substrata and the lowest percentage of settlement was observed on biofilms on the green substratum. High-throughput sequencing showed that bacterial community in biofilms also changed with the substratum colour. No significant difference in the inducing activity on plantigrade settlement was observed between the coloured substrata with no biofilms. Thus, difference in plantigrade settlement response may be correlated to the changes in bacterial community on coloured substrata. This finding extends current knowledge of interaction among mussel settlement and bacterial community variability.

TT  - Estrutura e dinâmica da comunidade de ciliados planctónicos em um grande rio Neotropical: a relevância da pluviosidade e tributários na manutençao da biodiversidade
AN  - 2110264607
AB  - Aim: We investigated the spatial and temporal patterns of abundance and diversity of planktonic ciliate community, in the last undammed stretch of the Upper Paraná River, Brazil. Methods: In order to reach this result, seven field campaigns were performed over two years. Plankton samples were collected from 10 transects through this stretch of the river (230 Km), near the banks and on the center, as well on seven of its tributaries. Results: 118 ciliate species were identified, among which the peritrichs were the most abundant while the order Hymenostomatida was the most specious group. We recorded a remarkable increase in abundance and species richness along the river, especially in the rainy period. Moreover, in this period we found an increase in the beta-diversity along the river, which consists in a remarkable distinction among the low, middle and high stretch ofthe river. In this way, continuous changes in the community structure of planktonic ciliates were evidenced, highlighting the importance of the precipitation and tributaries in the maintenance of the highest regional diversity in the studied area. Conclusion: Our results strongly suggest the requirement for conservation actions with the purpose to maintain those tributaries undammed, in order to avoid biotic homogenization processes and the consequent reduction of aquatic biodiversity in this important neotropical ecosystem.Alternate abstract:Objetivo: Investigaram-se no presente estudo os padröes espaciáis e temporais da abundancia e diversidade de espécies da comunidade de ciliados planctónicos, no último trecho livre de barramentos da planicie de inundaçâo do alto rio Paraná, Brasil. Métodos: Sete amostragens foram realizadas no periodo de dois anos. Amostras de ciliados foram coletadas ao longo de 10 transectos deste rio (230 Km), nas margens e no centro, bem como em sete de seus tributários. Resultados: Cento e dezoito espécies foram identificadas, dentre as quais, a ordem Peritrichia foi a mais abundante e Hymenostomatida a mais especiosa. Foi evidenciado um aumento na abundancia e riqueza de espécies ao longo do rio, especialmente no periodo chuvoso. Além disso, neste periodo foi registrado um incremento da diversidade beta ao longo do rio, consistindo em uma grande diferença entre os trechos a montante, intermediário e jusante da área de estudo. Assim, a gradativa alteraçâo na estrutura da comunidade de ciliados evidenciou uma grande influencia das chuvas e dos tributários na manutençâo da alta diversidade regional no trecho estudado. Conclusao: Os resultados evidenciam a necessidade de açöes de conservaçâo com o intuito de preservar os tributários livres de barramentos, a fim de evitar processos de homogeneizaçâo biótica e a consequente reduçâo da biodiversidade aquática neste importante ecossistema neotropical.

TT  - Variáveis ambientais que direcionam a distribuiçâo larval de Limnoperna fortunei na planicie de inundaçao do alto rio Paraná, Brasil
AN  - 2110240952
AB  - Aim: To verify the temporal dynamics of Limnoperna fortunei larval stages and to identify the main environmental variables driving the larval density patterns in an area highly impacted by reservoirs. Methods: Samplings were performed quarterly, from February to December 2014, in 10 transects along to the Paraná River main channel. For each sample site, 100 L of water were filtered. The filtrated was fixed in alcohol 80%, and the larval stages were counted and classified under the optical microscope. Concomitant to biological collections we took some of the main water variables. We performed a Redundancy Analysis (RDA) in order to summarize the variations in densities of larval stages in relation to the main physical and chemical water variables. Results: We found a total of200,590 L. fortunei larvae, in which 83.6% were identified as the initial stages. The most abundant months in L. fortunei larvae were December and February. The first two axes of RDA sum up 96% of the total data variation, and the most significant environmental variables explaining variations in larval densities were: water temperature, total nitrogen, electrical conductivity, phosphate, dissolved oxygen, depth and ammoniac ion. The warmer months were influenced by the major values of water temperature and depth, besides the higher densities of all larval stages. Conclusions: Our results indicate that L. fortunei reproduction follows a general pattern throughout the upper Paraná River floodplain, what seems to occur mainly between February and December. Thus, we suggest that measures for the L. fortunei control should be done during low-density periods (i.e., April to August), when the water level is low, and consequently, the dispersion of this species might be limited.Alternate abstract:Objetivo: Verificar a dinámica temporal dos estágios larvais de Limnoperna fortunei, e identificar as variáveis ambientais direcionadoras desses padröes, em uma área altamente impactada pela construçâo de reservatórios. Métodos: As amostragens foram realizadas trimestralmente, de fevereiro a dezembro de 2014, em 10 transectos ao longo do canal principal do rio Paraná. Para cada local de amostragem, foram filtrados 100 L de água. O filtrado foi fixado em álcool 80%, e os estágios larvais foram contados e identificados sob microscopio óptico. Concomitantemente as coletas biológicas, avaliamos as principais variáveis limnológicas nos pontos de amostragem. Realizamos uma ordenaçâo pela Análise de Redundancia (RDA), para sumarizar a variaçâo das densidades dos estágios larvais em relaçâo as principais variáveis físicas e químicas da água. Resultados: Encontramos um total de 200.590 larvas de L. fortunei, do qual 83,6% foram identificados como estágios iniciais. As densidades mais elevadas de larvas de L. fotunei foram os meses de dezembro e fevereiro. Os dois primeiros eixos da RDA sumarizaram 96% da variaçâo total dos dados, e as variáveis ambientais significativas para explicar as variaçöes nas densidades larvais foram: temperatura da água, nitrogenio total, condutividade elétrica, fosfato, oxigenio dissolvido, profundidade, e íon amonio. Os meses quentes foram influenciados pela temperatura e profundidade, juntamente com as maiores densidades dos estágios larvais. Conclusoes: Nossos resultados indicam que a reproduçâo segue um padrâo geral ao longo de toda a planície, acontecendo principalmente nos meses de fevereiro e dezembro. Assim, sugerimos que medidas de controle de L. fortunei devem ser tomadas nos períodos de baixas densidades (junho e agosto), quando o nivel da água está baixo, e consequentemente, sua dispersâo está limitada.

T1  - Transparency, Geomorphology and Mixing Regime Explain Variability in Trends in Lake Temperature and Stratification across Northeastern North America (1975–2014)
AN  - 2108723815
AB  - Lake surface water temperatures are warming worldwide, raising concerns about the future integrity of valuable lake ecosystem services. In contrast to surface water temperatures, we know far less about what is happening to water temperature beneath the surface, where most organisms live. Moreover, we know little about which characteristics make lakes more or less sensitive to climate change and other environmental stressors. We examined changes in lake thermal structure for 231 lakes across northeastern North America (NENA), a region with an exceptionally high density of lakes. We determined how lake thermal structure has changed in recent decades (1975–2012) and assessed which lake characteristics are related to changes in lake thermal structure. In general, NENA lakes had increasing near-surface temperatures and thermal stratification strength. On average, changes in deepwater temperatures for the 231 lakes were not significantly different than zero, but individually, half of the lakes experienced warming and half cooling deepwater temperature through time. More transparent lakes (Secchi transparency >5 m) tended to have higher near-surface warming and greater increases in strength of thermal stratification than less transparent lakes. Whole-lake warming was greatest in polymictic lakes, where frequent summer mixing distributed heat throughout the water column. Lakes often function as important sentinels of climate change, but lake characteristics within and across regions modify the magnitude of the signal with important implications for lake biology, ecology and chemistry.

T1  - Microbial Diseases of Bivalve Mollusks: Infections, Immunology and Antimicrobial Defense
AN  - 2108554956
AB  - A variety of bivalve mollusks (phylum Mollusca, class Bivalvia) constitute a prominent commodity in fisheries and aquacultures, but are also crucial in order to preserve our ecosystem’s complexity and function. Bivalve mollusks, such as clams, mussels, oysters and scallops, are relevant bred species, and their global farming maintains a high incremental annual growth rate, representing a considerable proportion of the overall fishery activities. Bivalve mollusks are filter feeders; therefore by filtering a great quantity of water, they may bioaccumulate in their tissues a high number of microorganisms that can be considered infectious for humans and higher vertebrates. Moreover, since some pathogens are also able to infect bivalve mollusks, they are a threat for the entire mollusk farming industry. In consideration of the leading role in aquaculture and the growing financial importance of bivalve farming, much interest has been recently devoted to investigate the pathogenesis of infectious diseases of these mollusks in order to be prepared for public health emergencies and to avoid dreadful income losses. Several bacterial and viral pathogens will be described herein. Despite the minor complexity of the organization of the immune system of bivalves, compared to mammalian immune systems, a precise description of the different mechanisms that induce its activation and functioning is still missing. In the present review, a substantial consideration will be devoted in outlining the immune responses of bivalves and their repertoire of immune cells. Finally, we will focus on the description of antimicrobial peptides that have been identified and characterized in bivalve mollusks. Their structural and antimicrobial features are also of great interest for the biotechnology sector as antimicrobial templates to combat the increasing antibiotic-resistance of different pathogenic bacteria that plague the human population all over the world.

T1  - The experimental set for <i>in situ</i> research of benthic communities in marine and freshwater ecosystems
AN  - 2056756258
AB  - The presented system of experimental trays permits conducting field experiments at considerable depths, all year round, and with no application of diving techniques. The deployed set can be entirely hidden under water, which is an advantage in crowded areas. The set is composed of single units, each composed of a tray filled with a substrate, four-legged bridles, and a hanging rope with a removable marker float fixed on top by means of a carabiner clip. The float provides information on the location of deployed trays, and permits proper distribution of next trays to be deployed. After deployment from a boat, the units are connected with a rope, extended on one end by a sinking retrieval rope. The floats are removed immediately after deployment. Any number of units can be deployed to the bottom. It depends on the experimental design and the number of replicates. Retrieval of the set starts with locating the trays by means of GPS, and searching for the retrieval rope by means of a grappling hook dragged behind the boat. Based on our own experience and the literature, the possibilities of development of the described system are proposed depending on the local field conditions and research objectives.
Le dispositif de plate-forme expérimentale présenté permet de réaliser des expériences de terrain à des profondeurs considérables, toute l'année, et sans besoin de techniques de plongée. L'ensemble déployé peut être entièrement caché sous l'eau, ce qui est un avantage dans les zones fréquentées. L'ensemble est composé d'unités simples, chacune composée d'un plateau rempli d'un substrat, avec une corde à chaque coin avec boucle, et d'une corde de suspension avec un flotteur marqueur amovible fixé au moyen d'un mousqueton. Le flotteur fournit des informations sur l'emplacement des plateaux déployés et permet une distribution correcte des plateaux successifs à déployer. Après le déploiement depuis un bateau, les unités sont reliées par une corde, prolongée à une extrémité par une corde de récupération lestée. Les flotteurs sont retirés immédiatement après le déploiement. Un nombre quelconque d'unités peut être déployé sur le fond. Cela dépend de la conception expérimentale et du nombre de répétitions. La récupération de l'ensemble commence par la localisation des plateaux au moyen du GPS et la recherche de la corde de récupération au moyen d'un crochet traîné derrière le bateau. Sur la base de notre propre expérience et de la littérature, les possibilités de développement du système décrit sont proposées en fonction des conditions locales de terrain et des objectifs de recherche.

T1  - Escape Burrowing of Modern Freshwater Bivalves as a Paradigm for Escape Behavior in the Devonian Bivalve Archanodon catskillensis
AN  - 1988722759
AB  - Many freshwater bivalves restore themselves to the sediment water interface after burial by upward escape burrowing. We studied the escape burrowing capacity of two modern unionoids, Elliptio complanata and Pyganodon cataracta and the invasive freshwater venerid Corbicula fluminea, in a controlled laboratory setting varying sediment grain size and burial depth. We found that the relatively streamlined E. complanata is a better escape burrower than the more obese P. cataracta. E. complanata is more likely to escape burial in both fine and coarse sand, and at faster rates than P. cataracta. However, successful escape from 10 cm burial, especially in fine sand, is unlikely for both unionoids. The comparatively small and obese C. fluminea outperforms both unionoids in terms of escape probability and escape time, especially when body size is taken into consideration. C. fluminea can escape burial depths many times its own size, while the two unionoids rarely escape from burial equivalent to the length of their shells. E. complanata, and particularly P. cataracta, are morphological paradigms for the extinct Devonian unionoid bivalve Archanodon catskillensis, common in riverine facies of the Devonian Catskill Delta Complex of the eastern United States. Our observations suggest that the escape burrowing capability of A. catskillensis was no better than that of P. cataracta. Archanodon catskillensis was likely unable to escape burial of more than a few centimeters of anastrophically deposited sediment. The long (up to 1 meter), vertical burrows that are associated with A. catskillensis, and interpreted to be its escape burrows, represent a response to episodic, small-scale sedimentation events due to patterns of repetitive hydrologic or weather-related phenomena. They are not a response to a single anastrophic event involving the influx of massive volumes of sediment.

T1  - An Analysis of Ship-Source Marine Pollution in Nigeria Seaports
AN  - 1952222245
AB  - Existing studies indicate that marine pollution control in the ports of developing economies is marred by a lack of administrative control and inadequate provision of waste reception facilities. In Nigeria ports, ship generated waste control services and provision of waste reception facilities are outsourced to private companies with no requirement for an activity audit. Apart from the port authority, other government agencies are also involved in pollution monitoring and control. Hence, functions are duplicated and effective regulation is arguably weakened by conflicts of interest. A scientific based integrated model is therefore proposed to address the managerial problem posed in the control of marine pollution in Nigerian ports. In this paper, we conduct a physico-chemical and microbiological analysis of samples of ships’ wastewater to determine the status of marine pollution in the port environment. The samples were collected from randomly selected ships at berths in seaport locations. The outputs from the analysis are then integrated as inputs into an administrative framework model. The integrated model developed is proposed as an alternative administrative tool for monitoring and controlling pollution in seaports. The policy implications of the developed model are discussed.

T1  - Genetic characterization of the Asian clam species complex (Corbicula) invasion in the Iberian Peninsula
AN  - 1835917910
AB  - The Asian clam (Corbicula sp.) is an invasive freshwater bivalve native to Asia, the Middle East, Australia, and Africa. It is now widely distributed around the world producing large ecological and economic impacts. Three well-described invasive lineages form a cryptic species complex with asexual reproduction based on androgenesis. In this study, we collected 175 individuals from different Iberian, European, and North American locations to genetically study Corbicula invasion in the Iberian Peninsula using COI and 28S genes. The use of mitochondrial and nuclear markers allows us to characterize both maternal and paternal inheritance from androgenetic Corbicula locations and to deal with the incongruences caused by egg parasitism. We identified 7 COI and 10 28S haplotypes that grouped individuals within the three invasive Corbicula lineages. Haplotype distribution of mitochondrial and nuclear markers detected genetic divergence between the Ebro Delta location and the rest of Iberian sites, suggesting that at least two invasion episodes occurred in the Iberian Peninsula. Haplotype distribution also suggested secondary contacts between Iberian and other European invaded regions. Additionally, results revealed that nuclear hybridization, a feature more widespread than previously reported, contributes to retain gene diversity in the Corbicula invasion.

T1  - Changing agricultural practices: potential consequences to aquatic organisms
AN  - 1839590934
AB  - Agricultural practices pose threats to biotic diversity in freshwater systems with increasing use of glyphosate-based herbicides for weed control and animal waste for soil amendment becoming common in many regions. Over the past two decades, these particular agricultural trends have corresponded with marked declines in populations of fish and mussel species in the Upper Conasauga River watershed in Georgia/Tennessee, USA. To investigate the potential role of agriculture in the population declines, surface waters and sediments throughout the basin were tested for toxicity and analyzed for glyphosate, metals, nutrients, and steroid hormones. Assessments of chronic toxicity with Ceriodaphnia dubia and Hyalella azteca indicated that few water or sediment samples were harmful and metal concentrations were generally below impairment levels. Glyphosate was not observed in surface waters, although its primary degradation product, aminomethyl phosphonic acid (AMPA), was detected in 77% of the samples (mean = 509 [mu]g/L, n = 99) and one or both compounds were measured in most sediment samples. Waterborne AMPA concentrations supported an inference that surfactants associated with glyphosate may be present at levels sufficient to affect early life stages of mussels. Nutrient enrichment of surface waters was widespread with nitrate (mean = 0.7 mg NO3-N/L, n = 179) and phosphorus (mean = 275 [mu]g/L, n = 179) exceeding levels associated with eutrophication. Hormone concentrations in sediments were often above those shown to cause endocrine disruption in fish and appear to reflect the widespread application of poultry litter and manure. Observed species declines may be at least partially due to hormones, although excess nutrients and herbicide surfactants may also be implicated.

T1  - Ecology of nonnative Siberian prawn (Palaemon modestus) in the lower Snake River, Washington, USA
AN  - 1836369052
AB  - We assessed the abundance, distribution, and ecology of the nonnative Siberian prawn Palaemon modestus in the lower Snake River, Washington, USA. Analysis of prawn passage abundance at three Snake River dams showed that populations are growing at exponential rates, especially at Little Goose Dam where over 464,000 prawns were collected in 2015. Monthly beam trawling during 2011-2013 provided information on prawn abundance and distribution in Lower Granite and Little Goose Reservoirs. Zero-inflated regression predicted that the probability of prawn presence increased with decreasing water velocity and increasing depth. Negative binomial models predicted higher catch rates of prawns in deeper water and in closer proximity to dams. Temporally, prawn densities decreased slightly in the summer, likely due to the mortality of older individuals, and then increased in autumn and winter with the emergence and recruitment of young of the year. Seasonal length frequencies showed that distinct juvenile and adult size classes exist throughout the year, suggesting prawns live from 1 to 2 years and may be able to reproduce multiple times during their life. Most juvenile prawns become reproductive adults in 1 year, and peak reproduction occurs from late July through October. Mean fecundity (189 eggs) and reproductive output (11.9 %) are similar to that in their native range. The current use of deep habitats by prawns likely makes them unavailable to most predators in the reservoirs. The distribution and role of Siberian prawns in the lower Snake River food web will probably continue to change as the population grows and warrants continued monitoring and investigation.

T1  - Cardiac performance: a thermal tolerance indicator in scallops
AN  - 1834762874
AB  - Thermal tolerance has become an active research area in marine poikilotherms due to the influence of increased sea temperature caused by global warming. Previous indicators of thermal tolerance in bivalves are generally laborious and time-consuming and even require killing the specimens. In this study, we demonstrated that heart rate (HR) was a stable and reliable indicator for scallop physiological status by applying an infrared-based cardiac performance monitoring system. The feasibility of HR-based Arrhenius break temperatures (ABTs) as a scallop thermal tolerance indicator was evaluated by investigating ABTs of four species with different thermal limits, including the Yesso scallop (Patinopecten yessoensis), the Zhikong scallop (Chlamys farreri), the bay scallop (Argopecten irradians), and the Catarina scallop (Argopecten ventricosus). In accordance with the thermal limits, ABTs of the Yesso scallop, Zhikong scallop, bay scallop, and Catarina scallop were 22.03 ± 0.19, 29.10 ± 0.25, 32.20 ± 0.25, and 34.09 ± 0.19 °C, respectively, suggesting that the ABT could indicate thermal limits in interspecific scallops. Variations in the ABTs were observed among intraspecific scallops with different sizes, weights, and ages, suggesting that smaller and younger scallops tend to have higher thermal limits. Significant differences in ABT were also observed between pre- and post-spawning individuals, implying that spawning behavior could decrease scallop thermal limits. The above results suggest that HR-based ABT can detect not only interspecific but also intraspecific thermal tolerance in scallops. This study reports the feasibility of infrared-based cardiac performance as a rapid, efficient, and noninvasive indicator for bivalve thermal tolerance.

T1  - Symbiotic bacteria of helminths: what role may they play in ecosystems under anthropogenic stress?
AN  - 1837405719
AB  - Symbiotic bacteria are a common feature of many animals, particularly invertebrates, from both aquatic and terrestrial habitats. These bacteria have increasingly been recognized as performing an important role in maintaining invertebrate health. Both ecto- and endoparasitic helminths have also been found to harbour a range of bacterial species which provide a similar function. The part symbiotic bacteria play in sustaining homeostasis of free-living invertebrates exposed to anthropogenic pressure (climate change, pollution), and the consequences to invertebrate populations when their symbionts succumb to poor environmental conditions, are increasingly important areas of research. Helminths are also susceptible to environmental stress and their symbiotic bacteria may be a key aspect of their responses to deteriorating conditions. This article summarizes the ecophysiological relationship helminths have with symbiotic bacteria and the role they play in maintaining a healthy parasite and the relevance of specific changes that occur in free-living invertebrate-bacteria interactions under anthropogenic pressure to helminths and their bacterial communities. It also discusses the importance of understanding the mechanistic sensitivity of helminth-bacteria relationships to environmental stress for comprehending the responses of parasites to challenging conditions.

T1  - Simulation of the Contribution of Phosphorus-Containing Minerogenic Particles to Particulate Phosphorus Concentration in Cayuga Lake, New York
AN  - 1833027408
AB  - Phosphorus (P) associated with minerogenic particles delivered from watersheds can interfere with the common use of total P (TP) concentration as a trophic state metric in lacustrine systems, particularly proximate to tributary entries, because of its limited bioavailability. The concentration of unavailable minerogenic particulate P (PPm/u), where it is noteworthy, should be subtracted from TP in considering primary production potential and trophic state levels. A first mass balance model for PPm/u is developed and tested here for Cayuga Lake, New York. This is supported by a rare combination of detailed information for minerogenic particle level dynamics for the tributaries and lake, the bioavailability of tributary particulate P (PP), and previously tested hydrothermal/transport and minerogenic particle concentration submodels. The central roles of major runoff events and localized tributary loading at one end of the lake in driving patterns of PPm/u in time and space are well simulated, including (1) the higher PPm/u concentrations in a shallow area ("shelf") adjoining the inputs, relative to pelagic waters, following runoff events, and (2) the positive dependence of the shelf increases on the magnitude of the event. The PPm/u component of P was largely responsible for the higher summer average TP on the shelf vs. pelagic waters and the exceedance of a TP water quality limit on the shelf. The effective simulation of PPm/u allows an appropriate adjustment of TP values to avoid overrepresentation of potential primary production levels.

This feature has been mostly studied in mytilids inhabiting the intertidal of consolidated rocky substrates, whereas it has been less studied in sedimentary substrates. The aim of this study was to evaluate the attachment strength and the number of byssal threads of Brachidontes rodriguezii in two sites with mobile substrates in San Antonio Bay, Argentina [Punta Verde (PV) and Punta Delgado (PD)]. PV has relatively higher current velocities and coarser grain size than PD. Along coastal line transects at two different levels of the mid-intertidal of each site, the attachment strength was measured. The number of byssal threads in collected mytilids and the weight of the sediment adhered to them were recorded in the lab. The attachment strength, the number of byssal threads and the sediment adhered to the byssus differed significantly between levels and sites. Mytilids from the mid-level of both sites where the density was relatively lower, had a significantly greater number of byssal threads and higher weight of sediment adhered. This study reveals that a high amount of coarse sediment adhered to the byssus affects the attachment strength of B. rodriguezii in ecosystems relative to unstable substrates. We underline the importance of mobile substrates in understanding attachment features (attachment strength and byssal threads) of mytilids in this unstable ecosystem.

T1  - Acute Toxicity of Metaldehyde in the Invasive Rice Snail Pomacea canaliculata and Sublethal Effects on Tadpoles of a Non-target Species (Rhinella arenarum)
AN  - 1828127032
AB  - We investigated the effects of exposure to molluscicidal metaldehyde (MET) on golden apple snail (GAS) Pomacea canaliculata and Rhinella arenarum tadpoles by assessing mortality and/or other effects via: acute toxicity assays; B-esterase activities (acetilcholinesterase (AChE) and carboxilesterase (CbE)) and oxidative responses (glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and catalase (CAT)). The effect of sublethal concentrations of MET was also analysed by assessing biochemical changes and swimming parameters in tadpoles. The LC50 value in P. canaliculata was as 0.50 mg L-1 and in R. arenarun tadpoles, 229.7 mg L-1 at 48 h. The intestine of MET-exposed P. canaliculata exhibited a significant reduction in CbE and CAT activities, but not in AChE activity; hepatopancreas of GAS showed a decreased GST activity decreased with respect to control individuals. In addition, a significant reduction of CbE activities was detected in R. arenarum tadpoles exposed to MET, and AChE presented lower values than the control but without statistical differences. Antioxidant enzymes (GST and CAT) were significantly reduced in tadpoles exposed to MET compared with the control group. In addition, MET had a significant effect on the swimming behaviour of R. arenarum. Finally, since amphibian tadpoles and P. canaliculata often co-occur, other native amphibian species should be studied to elucidate the ecological risk of MET to amphibian populations.

T1  - Can increased structural complexity decrease the predation of an alien crayfish on a native fish?
AN  - 1823366363
AB  - Interactions between predators and their prey are influenced by the habitats they occupy. In freshwater ecosystems, submerged vegetation provides protection for prey compared to unvegetated substrata. Using submerged plants (Hydrilla verticillata) as a refuge for Chinese bitterling (Rhodeus sinensis), a native fish, we conducted a series of laboratory experiments to test the impact of structural complexity and prey density on predation rate. We found that the number of Chinese bitterling eaten by alien crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) decreased with the increasing structural complexity and increased with prey density. Similar reductions in predation rate with increased habitat complexity occurred at all three different prey densities. Our study indicates that structural complexity can decrease the crayfish predation on freshwater fishes.

T1  - The cycle of mussels: long-term dynamics of mussel beds on intertidal soft bottoms at the White Sea
AN  - 1823366338
AB  - Dense blue mussel assemblages are unstable, their structure changing from year to year. Three types of models can be used to describe this instability: (1) "exogenous" model based on regional temperature fluctuations, (2) "endogenous" deterministic model associated with negative impact of adult mussels on juveniles and (3) "density-linked stochasticity" model based on positive feedbacks resulting in overcrowding and destabilizing the settlement. We compared predictions deduced from these models with a time series based on the results of long-term (18 years) monitoring of abundance and demographic structure of three mussel beds at the White Sea. Most of our findings agreed well with the predictions deduced from the endogenous model. In particular, (1) long-term changes in mussel abundance and demographic structure were strictly cyclic, with non-matching periods (5-9 years) at different sites; (2) stages with the dominance of old mussels alternated with those where juveniles dominated and (3) some signals of delayed density dependence were revealed. However, the time series also contained elements of long-term trends, which may testify to the involvement of some exogenous factors (probably long-term climate changes).

T1  - Spawning and multiple end points of the embryo-larval bioassay of the blue mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis (Lmk)
AN  - 1830828915
AB  - Since the 1960s, little has been done to improve and simulate the use of short-duration chronic bioassays of bivalve embryos, particularly in mussels. However, these test organisms offer great advantages in relation to other groups, due to the ease of obtaining breeders in cultivation systems, in the environment and any time, and due to their high sensitivity to chemicals or contaminants. To contribute some methodological aspects, this study uses techniques to stimulate spawning or improve the obtaining of gametes for use in bioassays with the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. It also evaluates different criteria for determining the effect on the larvae, for estimation of EC
50 and NOEC values, based on morphological analysis of developmental delay and the biometrics of the larvae. KCl proved to be a reliable inducer of spawning, with positive responses in 10 of the 12 months of the year tested. Moreover, this chemical, in association with NH
4Cl, demonstrated the capacity to activate immature oocytes obtained from extirpated gonads, enabling an improvement in fertilization rates. The different criteria adopted to determine the effects on the larvae in the assays with reference toxicants (SDS and K
2Cr2O7) resulted in EC50 and NOEC values without significant differences, indicating reliability in the results and freedom in the choice of criteria of effect to be adopted in the trials.

T1  - Ichthyofauna on a Tropical Mudflat: Implications of Spatial and Temporal Variability in Assemblage Structure and Abundance
AN  - 1828173634
AB  - Often seen as nonvegetated unutilized wastelands, mudflats pose the least resistance to land claim for coastal development. Here, we studied the large Klang mudflat (Straits of Malacca) from September 2011 to September 2014 to determine the fish species that utilize it and the abiotic factors that influence species composition and abundance, to evaluate the ecological role of the mudflat in support of coastal fisheries. The spatial and temporal assemblage of fish species and their abundance was examined at two sites, during two monsoon seasons, and under the effect of period (wet/dry), moon phase (full/new moon), and diel cycle (day/night). Fish were sampled during ebb tide by a stationary large barrier net that enclosed a calculable area of sampling. A total of 119 species belonging to 46 families of mainly small-sized and juvenile fish made regular ingressions into the mudflat throughout the year. Fish abundance varied spatially and temporally, suggesting site preference and variability in juvenile recruitment. Higher fish abundance due to recruitment occurred during the northeast monsoon season (NEM), as compared to the southwest monsoon. Fish composition but not total fish abundance during the NEM differed between wet/dry periods and diel cycles. Ariidae and Sciaenidae were dominant families during the wet period, whereas Engraulidae dominated during the dry period. Predatory fish species (e.g., Lagocephalus lunaris, Otolithes ruber, and Hexanematichthys sagor) were recorded during the daytime, whereas planktivorous and detrivorous species (e.g., Ambassis gymnocephalus and Liza subviridis) were more abundant during the night.

T1  - CYANOCOST special issue on cyanobacterial blooms: synopsis--a critical review of the management options for their prevention, control and mitigation
AN  - 1816418914
AB  - Nuisance, toxic cyanobacterial blooms are a persistent and globally expanding problem. Prevention of blooms requires that external and internal sources of nutrients are managed to levels where development of cyanobacterial blooms is restricted. Control of blooms, in which their presence is reduced to a level where they no longer pose a risk through additional measures such as biomanipulation or artificial mixing, demands that three elements come together: (1) understanding of the key ecological traits of the dominant cyanobacteria taxa, (2) system analysis of the lake, in particular its morphometry, water and nutrient balance, (3) adequate design and execution of the management methods of choice. All three elements are important for choosing effective management interventions and predicting their outcome. Mitigation of blooms reduces the risks and harmful effects of blooms if they cannot be prevented or sufficiently controlled, methods such as harvesting of surface scums or application of cyanocides may be used in those cases where water quality improvement is urgent. Ultimately, managing cyanobacterial blooms is most effective in the context of developing a Water Safety Plan. This is a risk assessment and management approach developed by the World Health Organization and provides a platform for bringing together the stakeholders who have a say about activities in the catchment causing eutrophication. Together, they can develop and implement control measures in the chain from catchment to drinking-water offtake which effectively mitigate eutrophication and thus protect humans and the lake ecosystem services they rely on from effects of toxic cyanobacteria.

T1  - Biomanipulation as a nature-based solution to reduce cyanobacterial blooms
AN  - 1816418907
AB  - We considered the limnological literature for an overview of biomanipulation methods that were implemented to avoid or reduce cyanobacterial bloom development in ponds and lakes. For this purpose, we reviewed 48 publications representing 34 whole-lake and large-scale case studies of different biomanipulation approaches clearly mentioning the extent of a cyanobacteria bloom problem and the cyanobacteria taxa involved. This delivered complementary information to the suite of review papers already providing elaborated syntheses on biomanipulation and associated ecotechnological measures as a restoration tool for overall eutrophication reduction and control. We considered nature-based solutions such as fish removal and associated water drawdown, addition of piscivorous fish, filter-feeding planktivorous fish, Daphnia or bivalves, re-introduction of macrophytes and a combination of accompanying restoration methods. Reasons for success or failure to control cyanobacterial blooms of especially Anabaena, Pseudanabaena, Aphanizomenon, Aphanocapsa, Limnothrix, Microcystis, Oscillatoria or Spirulina spp. could be explained through bottlenecks encountered with fish removal, stocking densities, cascading effects, associated zooplankton grazing, diet shifts away from cyanobacteria, macrophyte recovery, nutrient or pH status. Threshold values to avoid failures are synthesized from experiments or monitoring studies and presented in a conceptual scheme about cyanobacteria reduction through (1) direct abatement of existing blooms and forcing/maximization of biotic key interactions (2) reducing risk of blooms and improving lake or pond multi-functionality and (3) avoiding blooms, balancing biotic communities and enhancing existing ecosystem services. More information will be required on temporal dynamics and abundances of cyanobacteria taxa in whole-lake pre- and post-biomanipulation conditions to better evaluate the applicability and effectiveness of such nature-based solutions.

T1  - Personality, foraging behavior and specialization: integrating behavioral and food web ecology at the individual level
AN  - 1811908186
AB  - Behavioral traits and diet were traditionally thought to be highly plastic within individuals. This view was espoused in the widespread use of optimality models, which broadly predict that individuals can modify behavioral traits and diet across ecological contexts to maximize fitness. Yet, research conducted over the past 15 years supports an alternative view; fundamental behavioral traits (e.g., activity level, exploration, sociability, boldness and aggressiveness) and diet often vary among individuals and this variation persists over time and across contexts. This phenomenon has been termed animal personality with regard to behavioral traits and individual specialization with regard to diet. While these aspects of individual-level phenotypic variation have been thus far studied in isolation, emerging evidence suggests that personality and individual specialization may covary, or even be causally related. Building on this work, we present the overarching hypothesis that animal personality can drive specialization through individual differences in various aspects of consumer foraging behavior. Specifically, we suggest pathways by which consumer personality traits influence foraging activity, risk-dependent foraging, roles in social foraging groups, spatial aspects of foraging and physiological drivers of foraging, which in turn can lead to consistent individual differences in food resource use. These pathways provide a basis for generating testable hypotheses directly linking animal personality to ecological dynamics, a major goal in contemporary behavioral ecology.

T1  - The allometry of oysters: spatial and temporal variation in the length-biomass relationships for Crassostrea virginica
AN  - 1800541111
AB  - We examine the relationship of biomass B and length L in the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica by focusing on the scaling exponent b in the allometric equation B = aLbusing four datasets: Delaware Bay, Chesapeake Bay, Galveston Bay and a regionally extensive compilation from the NOAA Mussel Watch Program. The average value of the scaling exponent in Delaware Bay and Chesapeake Bay is about 2. For Galveston Bay, the value is distinctly higher, near 2.6. Over all Mussel Watch sites, the value is again near 2. Within Delaware Bay, the salinity gradient exerts an important effect. Shells are longer for their meat weight at lower salinities. The range of scaling exponents revealed by Mussel Watch data is exceedingly large (b < 1 to >3). Scaling exponents below 2.5 are unusual in bivalves. Among bivalves, only other oyster taxa have comparably low scaling exponents averaging near 2. We propose that oyster biomass routinely scales nearer the square of the length rather than the cube and that this is a constraint imposed by the exigency of carbonate production for reef maintenance and accretion in the face of high rates of taphonomic degradation. The adaptation as a reef builder requires the formation of carbonate that rapidly breaks down, thus requiring that carbonate produced be maximized. A biomass-to-length scaling exponent of 2 provides a mechanism to maximize shell production relative to biomass, while at the same time providing maximum surface area for the all-important settling of oyster spat to maintain the population.

T1  - Vegetation of riprapped revetments along the freshwater tidal Hudson River, New York
AN  - 1794349344
AB  - Issue Title: Special Section: Carbon Cycling in Aquatic Ecosystems

              
Riprapped revetments are a common shore defense along lakes, rivers, estuaries, and the ocean, but little is known about the ecology of these structures. We studied the amount and composition of vascular vegetation on riprapped revetments along the freshwater tidal Hudson River, New York. Cover, species richness, and species composition of vegetation varied greatly across the 21 study sites, from nearly barren sites to densely vegetated sites. The flora was split about equally between native and nonnative species, and vines were especially well represented. Vegetation cover and composition were correlated with the age, slope, particle size, and roughness of revetments, as well as site exposure and local management practices. We suggest that the ecological functions provided by revetment vegetation vary enormously from site to site along the Hudson, and could be enhanced by deliberate design and management.

T1  - How Common is "Non-textbook" Migration in Hudson River Blueback Herring?
AN  - 1794089308
AB  - Anadromous fishes are commonly thought to use inland waters for spawning and for rearing in the first growing season. Thereafter, they emigrate seaward to feed, grow, and mature. However, yearling (age 1+) alosine herrings have been observed in the Hudson River estuary during the spawning season. We quantified the frequency of this behavior for Blueback Herring (Alosa aestivalis) in two contrasting time periods: the 1980s-1990s, a period of relatively high abundance, and 2012-2013, a period of low abundance. Using otolith chemistry, we (1) assayed whether yearlings captured during the spawning run had egressed to sea and then returned to fresh water, and (2) examined adult spawners and retrospectively estimated the frequency of yearling returns to fresh water in these recruited fish. At least 36 % and up to 90 % of yearlings showed evidence of overwintering at sea or very far down the estuary prior to returning to fresh water with the spawning adults. Of the adults, 67-75 % showed evidence of returns up to fresh water as yearlings, despite large changes in population size and demographic characteristics. We conclude that this cryptic, "non-textbook" migratory behavior is common, and suggest that the importance of estuarine and freshwater nurseries may extend beyond the young-of-year period.

T1  - Allometric size-scaling of biometric growth parameters and metabolic and excretion rates. A comparative study of intertidal and subtidal populations of mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis)
AN  - 1783659834
AB  - Allometric relationships between biometric parameters (i.e., soft body and shell weights and shell organic content vs. shell length) as well as for routine and standard metabolic and ammonia excretion rates related to flesh weight and shell length were estimated and compared for subtidal and intertidal populations of Mytilus galloprovincialis in Galicia (NW Spain). This is the first report on allometric size-scaling of excretion and metabolic (both routine and standard) rates in this species. No evidences of differences in size exponent were found between physiological rates or between both populations for any physiological rate. Intercepts of regression lines were significantly higher in subtidal than in intertidal mussels, indicating greater levels of energy expenditure in the former. However, metabolic scope for feeding and growth was about two-fold in intertidal mussels, pointing to a reduced growth efficiency compared with subtidal mussels. Evolution of biometric parameters of body components with size indicated that subtidal mussels allocated energy resources preferably into flesh growth, achieving higher condition indices, while intertidal mussels put more effort on shell calcification and thickening which resulted in heavier shells of reduced organic content. These differentiated growth "strategies" of both populations could be related to their differences in growth efficiencies.

T1  - Chemical Assessment of Ballast Water Exchange Compliance: Implementation in North America and New Zealand
AN  - 2307425395
AB  - Fluorescence by naturally occurring dissolved organic matter (FDOM) is a sensitive indicator of ballast water source, with high FDOM in coastal ballast water decreasing typically dramatically when replaced by oceanic seawater during ballast water exchange. In this study, FDOM was measured in 92 ships arriving at Pacific ports on the US west coast and in New Zealand, and used to assess their compliance with ballast water regulations that required 95% replacement of port water to minimize invasive species risks. Fluorescence in many ships that reported ballast water exchange was significantly higher than is usual for oceanic seawater, and in several cases, significantly higher than in other ships with similar provenance and ballast water management. Pre-exchange source port conditions represented the largest source of uncertainty in the analysis, because residual coastal FDOM when highly fluorescent can significantly influence the fluorescence signature of exchanged ballast water. A meta-analysis comparing the intensities of FDOM in un-exchanged ballast tanks with calculated pre-exchange intensities assuming that ships all correctly implemented and reported ballast water exchange revealed notable discrepancies. Thus, the incidence of high-FDOM port waters was seven times lower in reality than would be expected on the basis of these calculations. The results suggest that a significant rate of reporting errors occur due to a combination of factors that may include inadequate ballast water exchange and unintentional or deliberate misreporting of ballast water management.

T1  - The valve movement response of three freshwater mussels Corbicula fluminea Müller 1774, Hyriopsis cumingii Lea 1852, and Anodonta woodiana Lea 1834 exposed to copper
AN  - 1774125147
AB  - Biological early warning system (BEWS) is an innovative system for real-time water quality monitoring based on different behavioral responses of aquatic organisms. Mussels easily meet the requirement for optimal organisms in BEWS. However, little emphasis has been placed on freshwater mussels. In this study, the Hall element sensor system has been used to investigate exposure-response relationships of valve movement in freshwater Corbicula fluminea, Hyriopsis cumingii, and Anodonta woodiana exposed to a copper (Cu^sup 2+^) gradient of 0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 mg l^sup -1^. The measured behavioral parameters were compared to determine if a response could be elucidated, including the amplitude of valve opening (AVO) and frequency of valve adduction (FVA). The results suggest that the mean AVO was significantly decreased in C. fluminea exposed to 0.1 and 1 mg l^sup -1^, and decreased for H. cumingii and A. woodiana after exposure to 10 mg l^sup -1^. The mean FVA was significantly decreased in H. cumingii exposed to 1 and 10 mg l^sup -1^, while A. woodiana revealed lower frequencies only at 10 mg l^sup -1^. The three species showed inherent rhythms of valve movements and dose-dependent responses upon copper exposure, and H. cumingii showed the most obvious profile of a copper dose-valve movement response.

T1  - Diel variability in fish assemblages in coastal wetlands and tributaries of the St. Lawrence River: a cautionary tale for fisheries monitoring
AN  - 1774123670
AB  - Both coastal wetlands and tributaries of waterbodies provide important and distinct habitat for freshwater fishes. While diel migration into and out of these systems is known to occur for some species, the resulting changes in fish assemblage composition and dominance are less well understood. To evaluate diel changes in the fish assemblages of a coastal wetland and tributary, fish community surveys were completed at ten locations during the day (noon) and night (midnight) in Cooper's Marsh, a coastal wetland in the St. Lawrence River, and the Raisin River, a nearby tributary. Catch per unit effort (CPUE) and species richness were highest in the coastal wetland during the night sampling period. Species-specific differences were also apparent with high CPUE of Mimic Shiner in the marsh at night. Differences within the river were less pronounced, suggesting less diel variability in fish assemblage structure, possibly driven by the more constrained nature of fluvial systems. These results contribute to our understanding of diel movement patterns of fishes and the natural diel variability in species assemblages that can occur. These findings also emphasize that when engaged in environmental monitoring and assessment, it is important to consider how diel variation in fish assemblage structure will influence conclusions regarding the biotic components of a given aquatic ecosystem.

T1  - A novel approach for the development of tiered use biological criteria for rivers and streams in an ecologically diverse landscape
AN  - 1771232542
AB  - Water resource protection goals for aquatic life are often general and can result in under protection of some high quality water bodies and unattainable expectations for other water bodies. More refined aquatic life goals known as tiered aquatic life uses (TALUs) provide a framework to designate uses by setting protective goals for high quality water bodies and establishing attainable goals for water bodies altered by legally authorized legacy activities (e.g., channelization). Development of biological criteria or biocriteria typically requires identification of a set of least- or minimally-impacted reference sites that are used to establish a baseline from which goals are derived. Under a more refined system of stream types and aquatic life use goals, an adequate set of reference sites is needed to account for the natural variability of aquatic communities (e.g., landscape differences, thermal regime, and stream size). To develop sufficient datasets, Minnesota employed a reference condition approach in combination with an approach based on characterizing a stream's response to anthropogenic disturbance through development of a Biological Condition Gradient (BCG). These two approaches allowed for the creation of ecologically meaningful and consistent biocriteria within a more refined stream typology and solved issues related to small sample sizes and poor representation of minimally- or least-disturbed conditions for some stream types. Implementation of TALU biocriteria for Minnesota streams and rivers will result in consistent and protective goals that address fundamental differences among waters in terms of their potential for restoration.

T1  - Biodiversity of Spongosorites coralliophaga (Stephens, 1915) on coral rubble at two contrasting cold-water coral reef settings
AN  - 1771025000
AB  - Issue Title: THEME SECTION ON MESOPHOTIC REEFS              Cold-water coral reefs (CWRs) in the northeast Atlantic harbor diverse sponge communities. Knowledge of deep-sea sponge ecology is limited and this leaves us with a fragmented understanding of the ecological roles that sponges play in CWR ecosystems. We present the first study of faunal biodiversity associated with the massive demosponge Spongosorites coralliophaga (Stephens, 1915) that typically colonizes coral debris fields of CWRs. Our study focused on the sessile fauna inhabiting sponges mixed with coral rubble at two contrasting settings in the northeast Atlantic: the shallow inshore (120-190 m water depth) Mingulay Reef Complex (MRC) and the deep offshore (500-1200 m) Logachev Mound (LM) coral province. MRC is dominated by the scleractinian Lophelia pertusa, while LM is dominated by L. pertusa and Madrepora oculata. Nine sponge-coral rubble associations were collected from MRC and four from LM. Measurements of abundance, species richness, diversity, evenness, dry biomass, and composition of sessile fauna on sponge and coral rubble microhabitats were undertaken. Differences in community composition between the two regions were mainly a response to changes in fauna with depth. Fauna composition was also different between sponge and coral rubble within each region. Infauna constituted a minor component of the sponge-associated fauna in MRC but had a higher contribution in LM. Sponge and coral rubble sessile fauna in both regions was mainly composed of cnidarians and molluscs, similarly to some previous studies. Sponges' outer surfaces at MRC were colonized by a species-rich community with high abundance and biomass suggesting that S. coralliophaga at MRC acts as a settlement surface for various organisms but such a role is not the case at LM. This difference in the role of S. coralliophaga as a biological structure is probably related to differences in fauna composition with depth, bottom current speed, and the quantity/quality of food supplied to the benthos.

T1  - Relative benefit of the invasive Echinogammarus berilloni (Catta, 1878) over native gammarids under fish predation (Gasterosteus aculeatus Linnaeus, 1758)
AN  - 1762628188
AB  - Running waters of Central Europe are progressively invaded by the southwest European amphipod Echinogammarus berilloni--as currently observed in the karstic upper River Lippe catchment (Paderborn Plateau, northwest Germany). We tested experimentally whether the succession of the invader is favored by lower predation intensity of three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) compared to predation on the native gammarids Gammarus pulex and G. fossarum. Predation experiments were combined with two modifiers: species interaction (separate exposure of each species vs. joint exposure of each native species with the invader) and habitat structure (absence vs. availability of refuge structures as hideouts against predation). When the species were exposed separately to the predator and no refuges were offered, predation rates did not differ significantly. When refuges were present, predation success generally decreased, but was relatively lower on the invader E. berilloni than on the native species. When native and the invasive species were exposed jointly to predation, predation success decreased further in both species combinations. However, under both conditions, with and without refuge structures, survival of E. berilloni was significantly greater than in G. pulex. The findings corroborate our assumption that the invader E. berilloni profits from sympatric occurrence with native gammarid species, especially when hideout options are available. Whether this effect was caused by competition for refuges or simply by a relatively lower activity level of E. berilloni and smaller predator stimulus for the fish remains to be cleared. Without doubt, the difference in predation is a factor that contributes to the invader's success.

T1  - Length-mass relationships for lake macroinvertebrates corrected for back-transformation and preservation effects
AN  - 1761208056
AB  - Length-mass relationships are widely used to estimate body mass from body dimensions for freshwater macroinvertebrates. The relationships are influenced by environmental conditions and should be applied within ecosystems and geographic regions similar to those for which they were estimated. However, very few relationships exist for littoral macroinvertebrates, and thus we provide length-mass relationships for macroinvertebrates from lakes of the Central European lowlands. We compared log-linear and nonlinear methods for fitting length-mass relationships and tested the smearing factor for removing bias in mass predictions from log-linear models. We also estimated conversion factors to correct for mass changes during ethanol preservation and assessed the transferability of our results to different geographical regions. We showed that the log-linear approach gave better results in fitting length-mass relationships, while residuals showed that nonlinear models over-predict the mass of small individuals. The smearing correction factor successfully removed bias introduced by log transformation, and relationships transferred well between lakes in the same and different geographical regions. In total, 52 bias-corrected length-mass relationships are provided for littoral macroinvertebrates that are applicable also to lakes in geographic regions with similar environmental conditions, such as the Central European lowlands or the temperate lowland zone of America.

T1  - Exposure of bivalve shellfish to titania nanoparticles under an environmental-spill scenario: Encounter, ingestion and egestion
AN  - 1769590555
AB  - Nanoparticles have applications in a diverse range of products including medications, detergents, cosmetics, paint, sunscreen and electronics, with an economic worth projected to reach $2.5 trillion dollars in 2015. Research into the effects of manufactured nanomaterials on the environment, however, has failed to keep pace with the high volume of commercial production. Whereas a number of studies have examined the effects of nanoparticles on aquatic species, little work has focused on the way in which benthic marine species encounter, ingest and depurate these materials. The purpose of this study was to examine the ingestion and depuration of titania nanoparticles (anatase) by the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) and the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) during a spill scenario (an acute exposure to elevated concentrations). Bivalves were exposed to nanoparticles either incorporated into marine snow, an environmentally relevant medium for pollutants, or added directly to seawater at a concentration of 4.5 mg L-1 for 2 h. After feeding, the animals were transferred to filtered seawater and allowed to depurate. Faeces and tissues were collected at 0, 6, 24, 72 and 120 h, post-exposure, and analysed for concentrations of titanium by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Results indicated that the capture and ingestion of titania nanoparticles by both species was not dependent on the method of delivery (incorporated into marine snow or freely suspended). Additionally, greater than 90% of the titania nanoparticles, on average, were eliminated from the tissues after 6 h, and only trace amounts remained after 72 h. These data demonstrate that mussels and oysters readily ingest titania nanoparticles, but rapidly depurate the material within hours of an acute exposure suggesting that little would be transferred to secondary consumers including humans. Further research is required to determine if other species of suspension-feeders handle titania nanoparticles in a manner similar to bivalves.

T1  - In situ biomonitoring shows seasonal patterns and environmentally mediated gaping activity in the bivalve, Pinna nobilis
AN  - 1757874086
AB  - The rhythms and responses of animals to environmental factors are important issues for their adaptation to natural cycles. These rhythms assure an optimum synchrony between organisms and their environment. Bio-logging enables monitoring these activity cycles remotely. To characterize rhythms and responses of fan mussels (Pinna nobilis) to environmental factors, six individuals were monitored from April 2009 to October 2011. The study was conducted at a station in the western Mediterranean at 11 m depth in Tabarca Island Marine Reserve (Alicante, Spain). Sensors at the station monitored dissolved oxygen (mg l^sup -1^), turbidity (ntu), temperature (°C), chlorophyll a concentration (chl a) (mg m^sup -3^), current speed (cm s^sup -1^), and direction (°). One pattern of gaping activity (P1) occurred from mid-July-early August-early November, whereas another pattern (P2) occurred the rest of the time (i.e., from early November-mid-July-early August). The activity was synchronized among the fan mussels and showed autocorrelation peaks at a period of 21.9-24 h. In P1, the fan mussels opened their valves according to the position and illumination of the sun and moon. In P2, however, individuals did not track sun and moonlight, although their gaping activity was regular and synchronized. Likewise, individuals were unaffected by high-frequency (daily) variation in dissolved oxygen and (chl a). Gaping activity was directly influenced by current intensity and direction. The shift between the two patterns and the presence of similar periods of autocorrelation in the activity time series indicate that P. nobilis has an internal clock.

T1  - Sharing the load: a survey of parasitism in the invasive freshwater pulmonate, Physa acuta (Hygrophila: Physidae) and sympatric native snail populations
AN  - 1750700322
AB  - The highly invasive freshwater snail, Physa acuta, was examined for parasites over temporal and spatial scales. All populations studied had a high prevalence of the parasitic morph of the oligochaete worm, Chaetogaster limnaei. This worm was also found to infect two native snails, Glyptophysa gibbosa and Austropeplea tomentosa, at lower prevalences. Seasonality and collection sites did not significantly influence the worm's infection dynamics, but strong positive correlations were found between the sizes of P. acuta individuals and both the likelihood of infection and infection intensity. The ectocommensal morph of C. limnaei was found in all three pulmonate species. Physa acuta was infected with two digenean trematode species which were also found in two native snails, Posticobia brazieri and G. gibbosa. One digenean, found within the renal gland of P. acuta, did not significantly influence the presence or infection intensity of the renal gland-dwelling C. limnaei parasitic morph. All parasites infecting P. acuta were also found to be infecting sympatric native freshwater snails. The effects that such host sharing by parasites may have upon the establishment of P. acuta as a successful invader merit further study.

T1  - Biomonitoring Climate Change and Pollution in Marine Ecosystems: A Review on Aulacomya ater
AN  - 1816601691
AB  - The sedentarism and wide global distribution of the blue mussel Mytilus edulis have made it a useful bioindicator to assess changes in the health status of the marine ecosystem in response to pollution and other environmental stresses. Effective biomonitoring of an ecosystem requires, however, that multiple biomarkers be used to obtain an accurate measure of the cumulative effects of different sources of environmental stress. Here, we provide a first integrated review of the biological, economical, and geographical characteristics of another species of mussels, the ribbed mussel Aulacomya ater. We discuss the use of Aulacomya ater as a complementary biomonitor to the blue mussel to assess the impact of pollutants and climate change. Recent findings have indeed shown that Mytilus edulis and Aulacomya ater have distinctive anatomy and physiology and respond differently to environmental stress. Monitoring of mixed beds containing blue and ribbed mussels may thus represent a unique opportunity to study the effect of environmental stress on the biodiversity of marine ecosystems, most notably in the Southern hemisphere, which is particularly sensitive to climate change and where both species often cohabitate in the same intertidal zones.

T1  - Adaptive capabilities of hydrobionts to aqueous medium with different physicochemical parameters
AN  - 1776785933
AB  - The causes and physiological-biochemical mechanisms of migration of marine species of hydrobionts to fresh waters of the Dnieper River and the cascade of its reservoirs have been investigated. The possible adaptation of marine fish species and invertebrates is related to the economic human activity: regulation of river runoff, creation of a cascade of reservoirs with large water-surface area, anthropogenic pollution of natural water, and also changes of climate conditions on the Earth (global warming). It is presumed that these processes result in significant change of physicochemical indicators of aquatic medium. One can observe the rise of mineralization, increase of the number of biogenic compounds, variation of their ratio in fresh water that, in turn, allows the marine species of hydrobionts to adapt to new conditions and advance upstream.

T1  - Impact of multiple anthropogenic stressors on freshwater: how do glyphosate and the invasive mussel Limnoperna fortunei affect microbial communities and water quality?
AN  - 1758957673
AB  - The study of the joint effect of multiple anthropogenic stressors is important because the emerging consequences are often unpredictable on the basis of knowledge of single effects. We explored the joint impact of glyphosate and the invasive golden mussel Limnoperna fortunei on freshwater phytoplankton, bacterioplankton and periphyton, and on the physical and chemical properties of the water. We manipulated both stressors simultaneously in a 25-day experiment using outdoor mesocosms; we assayed technical-grade glyphosate acid at four concentrations: 0, 1, 3 and 6 mg gly L^sup -1^ under scenarios with and without mussels. The addition of the glyphosate significantly increased total phosphorus according to the concentration used; the high clearance rate of L. fortunei significantly decreased phytoplanktonic abundance leading to low values of turbidity. The mussel significantly stimulated the development of filamentous green algae (metaphyton). Interestingly, the combined effect revealed that L. fortunei accelerated the dissipation of glyphosate, which showed a 4-fold decrease in its half-life; this promoted the rapid bioavailability of glyphosate-derived phosphorus in the water. The interaction had a synergistic effect on soluble reactive phosphorus concentrations and was directly dependent on the concentration of glyphosate. A synergistic effect was also observed on bacterioplankton, water turbidity and metaphyton, thus inducing enhanced and rapid eutrophication. The ability of mussels to reduce glyphosate in water may be valued as positive, but our results allow us to predict that the invasion of Limnoperna fortunei in natural freshwater systems contaminated by glyphosate will accelerate the negative impact of the herbicide associated with eutrophication.

T1  - A question of origin: dioxin-like PCBs and their relevance in stock management of European eels
AN  - 1758956278
AB  - The stock of European Eel (Anguilla anguilla L.) has reached an all-time low in 2011. Spawner quality of mature eels in terms of health status and fitness is considered one of the key elements for successful migration and reproduction. Dioxin-like Polychlorinated Biphenyls (dl-PCBs) are known persistent organic pollutants potentially affecting the reproductive capability and health status of eels throughout their entire lifetime. In this study, muscle tissue samples of 192 European eels of all continental life stages from 6 different water bodies and 13 sampling sites were analyzed for contamination with lipophilic dl-PCBs to investigate the potential relevance of the respective habitat in light of eel stock management. Results of this study reveal habitat-dependent and life history stage-related accumulation of targeted PCBs. Sum concentrations of targeted PCBs differed significantly between life stages and inter-habitat variability in dl-PCB levels and -profiles was observed. Among all investigated life stages, migrant silver eels were found to be the most suitable life history stage to represent their particular water system due to habitat dwell-time and their terminal contamination status. With reference to a possible negative impact of dl-PCBs on health and the reproductive capability of eels, it was hypothesized that those growing up in less polluted habitats have a better chance to produce healthy offspring than those growing up in highly polluted habitats. We suggest that the contamination status of water systems is fundamental for the life cycle of eels and needs to be considered in stock management and restocking programs.

T1  - Early post-dredging recolonization of caddisflies (Insecta: Trichoptera) in a small lowland river (NW Poland)
AN  - 1748993289
AB  - An analysis was made of the effect of dredging on the caddisfly fauna (Trichoptera) of the river Krpiel (north-western Poland) a short time after the intervention. Pronounced changes were observed in the qualitative and quantitative structure and the biodiversity of Trichoptera. These changes should not, however, be characterized as unfavourable from an ecological perspective if we consider only the one group of insects analysed. Some species -- Brachycentrus subnubilus and Lepidostoma hirtum -- disappeared from the dredged parts of the river, but significantly more appeared, and these were typical river species. This replacement of species can be linked to habitat changes and the uncovering of larger patches of sandy bottom. The recolonizing species included accidental (eurytopic) species, which is typical in ecological succession for periods immediately following disturbances. On balance, despite the replacement of species, there was no decrease in species diversity, and typical river species appeared in larger numbers. In Trichoptera, recolonization following dredging first takes place as a result of drift of larvae, and then via dispersion of adults.

T1  - Feeding activity and diet composition of round goby (Neogobius melanostomus, Pallas 1814) in the coastal waters of SE Baltic Sea
AN  - 1861422411
AB  - Feeding activity and diet composition of round goby were investigated in the south-eastern Baltic Sea, the Lithuanian coastal waters during May-October 2012 in order to determine main feeding objects and seasonal periods when native fauna could be most affected by predation of this highly invasive species. In total, prey represented by 18 taxa was found in the gut contents of dissected fish. Feeding activity of round goby varied depending on the body size, sex and stage of the reproduction period. The gut contents of < 50 mm specimens were dominated by zooplanktonic and meiobenthic organisms, whereas larger individuals (50-99 mm) shifted to amphipods and mollusks. Individuals of the intermediate 100-200 mm length had a variable diet, changing depending on the season; in spring they mostly preyed on Macoma balthica, in summer - on polychaetes, while in autumn the contribution of Mytilus trossulus and fish considerably increased in their diet. Diet composition of individuals ≥ 200 mm was relatively constant in the course of the study with substantial preference to M. balthica. These findings imply that benthic fauna, particularly a newly settled generation of epibenthic mollusks in autumn is under strong predatory pressure of the round goby.

T1  - Dietary Reliance on Benthic Primary Production as a Predictor of Mercury Accumulation in Freshwater Fish and Turtles
AN  - 1712731847
AB  - The feeding ecology of a species can affect the transfer and accumulation of contaminants such as mercury (Hg). Modeling the accumulation of Hg through food webs can help identify which animals are likely to be burdened by elevated Hg concentrations. In lakes, most of the Hg is sequestered in the sediments. Therefore, species ultimately relying on benthic primary production may experience a greater trophic transfer of Hg relative to species that rely on pelagic primary production. This hypothesis was tested in a simple food web using muscle tissue collected from three species of fish (Lepomis gibbosus, Notropis heterodon, and Labidesthes sicculus) and blood from two species of turtles (Sternotherus odoratus and Chrysemys picta) that differ in reliance on benthic primary production. Averaged multiple linear regression models were used to predict Hg concentrations in the five consumers with respect to reliance on benthic primary production, while controlling for other factors known to influence Hg accumulation (sex, size, lake, species identity, and trophic level). A positive and significant relationship was found between Hg burden and dietary reliance on benthic primary production, animal length, trophic level, and species identity in fish. In turtles, the relationship between Hg burden and dietary reliance on benthic primary production was not significant, but trophic level, animal length, and species identity significantly influenced Hg burden. Overall, reliance on benthic primary production was an important predictor of Hg burden for fish, but not for turtles. Future attempts to model Hg accumulation in similar study systems and/or fish species should include dietary reliance on benthic primary production as a predictor variable.

T1  - Benthic cyanobacterial mats serve as a refuge and food for the amphipod Gammarus fasciatus
AN  - 1702196881
AB  - We investigated the ecological role of Lyngbya wollei (Farlow ex Gomont, comb. nov.) cyanobacterial mats in aquatic ecosystems, especially as a food source and shelter for the amphipod Gammarus fasciatus (Say). For this, we offered amphipods a choice between mats of L. wollei and either chlorophytes (Spirogyra, Rhizoclonium) or an artificial mat made of acrylic wool in laboratory experiment. Moreover, we reconstructed in situ amphipod diet using a dual isotope mixing model (δ^sup 13^C and δ^sup 15^N). G. fasciatus consistently selected the substratum offering the best light refuge (Acrylic > Lyngbya = Rhizoclonium > Spirogyra). Neither the presence/absence of saxitoxins, nor the tissue elemental composition and epiphyte abundance exerted any significant effect on substratum choice. L. wollei and its epiphytes constituted 36 and 24%, respectively, of the in situ diet of G. fasciatus, whereas chlorophytes, macrophytes, and associated epiphytes represented a less important fraction of its diet. Benthic cyanobacterial mats should be considered a good shelter and food source for small omnivorous invertebrates such as amphipods.

T1  - Evidence of the St. Clair-Detroit River System as a dispersal corridor and nursery habitat for transient larval burbot
AN  - 1699159831
AB  - Issue Title: THEMED SECTION: Ecology, Culture, and Management of Burbot

              
Burbot Lota lota are distributed across the Laurentian Great Lakes where they occupy a top piscivore role. The St. Clair-Detroit River System is known to provide a migration corridor as well as spawning and nursery habitat for many indigenous fishes of economic and ecological significance. However, knowledge is scant of the early life history of burbot and the importance of this system in their dispersal, survival, and recruitment. In order to assess the role of the St. Clair-Detroit River System to burbot ecology, we collected larval burbot during ichthyoplankton surveys in this system from 2010 to 2013 as part of a habitat restoration monitoring program. More and larger burbot larvae were found in the St. Clair River than in the lower Detroit River, although this may be due to differences in sampling methods between the two rivers. Consistent with existing studies, larval burbot exhibited ontogenesis with a distinct transition from a pelagic zooplankton-based diet to a benthic macroinvertebrate-based diet. Our results demonstrate that the St. Clair-Detroit Rivers provide food resources, required habitat, and a migration conduit between the upper and lower Great Lakes, but the contribution of these fish to the lower lakes requires further examination.

T1  - Bioaccumulation of metals in three freshwater mussel species exposed in situ during and after dredging at a coal ash spill site (Tennessee Valley Authority Kingston Fossil Plant)
AN  - 1686748476
AB  - On December 22, 2008, a dike containing coal fly ash at the Tennessee Valley Authority Kingston Fossil Plant (TN, USA) failed, and within months, dredging operations began to remove ash-contaminated sediments. The purpose of this study was to investigate differences in the bioaccumulation of metals in three mussel species during and after dredging operations. Mussels were caged for approximately 1 year during dredging and after, and then mussel condition index values and As, Cd, Cr, Pb, Ni, Se, Hg, U, Fe, Mg, Al, Sb, Ba, Be, Co, Cu, Mn, Mo, Ag, Sr, Tl, V, and Zn concentrations in soft tissue were determined via inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometery. Overall, the differences observed in metal bioaccumulation and mussel health suggest that mussels in the immediate downstream area of the dredging site may have been impacted, as evidenced by a significant decrease in mussel condition index values, but that this impact did not result in increased tissue concentrations of metals.

T1  - Modelling dynamic ecosystems: venturing beyond boundaries with the Ecopath approach
AN  - 1680118629
AB  - Thirty years of progress using the Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) approach in different fields such as ecosystem impacts of fishing and climate change, emergent ecosystem dynamics, ecosystem-based management, and marine conservation and spatial planning were showcased November 2014 at the conference "Ecopath 30 years-modelling dynamic ecosystems: beyond boundaries with EwE". Exciting new developments include temporal-spatial and end-to-end modelling, as well as novel applications to environmental impact analyses, in both aquatic and terrestrial domains. A wide range of plug-ins have been added to extend the diagnostic capabilities of EwE, and the scientific community is applying EwE to a diversified range of topics besides fishing impact assessments, such as the development of scientific advice for management, the analysis of conservation issues, and the evaluation of cumulative impacts of environmental and human activities in marine food webs (including habitat modification and the invasion of alien species). Especially promising is the new potential to include the EwE model in integrated assessments with other models such as those related to climate change research. However, there are still many challenges, including the communication of scientific results in management procedures. In addition, other important scientific issues are how to improve model result validation and perform model quality control. During the conference, the Ecopath International Research and Development Consortium was presented as a way for the EwE user community to become involved in the long-term sustainability of the EwE approach. Overall, exciting times are facing the ecosystem modelling scientific community, and as illustrated by the conference: synergistic cooperation is the future path for the EwE approach.

T1  - Ontogenetic changes in isotopic signatures of an omnivorous fish Cultrichthys erythropterus in East Lake Taihu, China
AN  - 1677307969
AB  - The relationship between body size and stable isotopic signatures of the omnivorous Redfin Culter (Cultrichthys erythropterus), commonly found in East Lake Taihu, was investigated. Previous analyses of C. erythropterus stomach contents have shown that this species undergoes a diet switch from being predominantly zooplanktivorous to piscivorous during its life history. This was confirmed by stable carbon isotopic signature (δ^sup 13^C) in this study, in which δ^sup 13^C was positively correlated with both standard length and weight. The importance of littoral-benthic resources in supporting C. erythropterus during its lifespan was also demonstrated using a two-source mixing model, the results of which showed a significant increasing trend in the contribution of littoral-benthic energy. However, the stable nitrogen isotopic signature (δ^sup 15^N) exhibited an unusual pattern compared with previous studies. The δ^sup 15^N of C. erythropterus showed no relationship with body size, even though dietary changes were observed. This indicated that δ^sup 15^N alone cannot fully reflect a diet shift in a species and possible variability in isotopic signatures over its life history. This should be considered when using stable isotopic signatures to investigate intra-specific variations and the timing of life-history events, such as estimating the trophic positions of fish species.

T1  - Temperature effects induced by climate change on the growth and consumption by salmonines in Lakes Michigan and Huron
AN  - 1658651007
AB  - We used bioenergetics models to investigate temperature effects induced by climate change on the growth and consumption by Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, lake trout Salvelinus namaycush, and steelhead O. mykiss in Lakes Michigan and Huron. We updated biological inputs to account for recent changes in the food webs and used temperature inputs in response to regional climate observed in the baseline period (1964-1993) and projected in the future period (2043-2070). Bioenergetics simulations were run across multiple age-classes and across all four seasons in different scenarios of prey availability. Due to the increased capacity of prey consumption, future growth and consumption by these salmonines were projected to increase substantially when prey availability was not limited. When prey consumption remained constant, future growth of these salmonines was projected to decrease in most cases but increase in some cases where the increase in metabolic cost can be compensated by the decrease in waste (egestion and excretion) loss. Consumption by these salmonines was projected to increase the most during spring and fall when prey energy densities are relatively high. Such seasonality benefits their future growth through increasing annual gross energy intake. Our results indicated that lake trout and steelhead would be better adapted to the warming climate than Chinook salmon. To maintain baseline growth into the future, an increase of 10 % in baseline prey consumption was required for Chinook salmon but considerably smaller increases, or no increases, in prey consumption were needed by lake trout and steelhead.

T1  - Length- and weight-dependent clearance rates of juvenile mussels (Mytilus edulis) on various planktonic prey items
AN  - 1655676224
AB  - Filtration capacity and feeding behaviour has been intensely studied for adult mussels (Mytilus edulis), but less information is available for juvenile mussels (1.5-25 mm, <1 year), especially in natural sea water. The recent introduction of mussel seed collectors in the Netherlands prompted the need for more detailed information on juvenile mussel behaviour. To estimate the impact of juvenile populations on ecosystem carrying capacity, information on clearance rate as well as usage of different prey items is essential. Clearance rates were measured in an experimental study, incubating juvenile mussels in natural sea water. Rates were related to isometrics as well as specified for the prey items bacteria, picophytoplankton (<3 [mu]m), nanophytoplankton (3-20 [mu]m), and ciliates. Results showed that the clearance rate of juvenile mussels depends on shell length^sup 2^, while the relationship between clearance rate and weight was more variable. Length is thus a better parameter for estimating clearance rate than weight. Ciliates and nanophytoplankton were cleared at comparable, but variable rates, while picoalgae were cleared from the water at the rate of 11-64 % compared to nanophytoplankton. For bacteria, the clearance rate was on average 9 %. This study showed different retention of particles of similar size (picoalgae and bacteria) as well as variability in particle retention for the different prey items. This variable retention efficiency could not be related to seston concentration nor to dominance in cell size. The results from this study can be used to estimate the effect of mussel seed collectors on the carrying capacity of the Dutch Wadden Sea.

T1  - Bioaccumulation of BDE-47 and effects on molecular biomarkers acetylcholinesterase, glutathione-S-transferase and glutathione peroxidase in Mytilus galloprovincialis mussels
AN  - 1655078892
AB  - Mussels, Mytilus galloprovincialis, showed a high bioaccumulation ability when exposed to waterborne tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47), with a bioconcentration factor of 10,900 L Kg^sup -1^ wet weight, and slow depuration rates in clean seawater. Kinetic and concentration-response experiments were performed measuring in the exposed mussel the activities of three molecular biomarkers: glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE). The long term (30 days) exposure of mussels to all concentrations (2-15 µg L^sup -1^) of BDE-47 significantly inhibited the AChE and GST activities, a result that supports the suitability of these biomarkers in marine pollution monitoring programs. However, GPx activity showed a less consistent pattern of response depending on the concentration and the duration of exposure.

T1  - From the laboratory to the wild: salinity-based genetic differentiation of the European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) using gene-associated and gene-independent microsatellite markers
AN  - 1654574137
AB  - Convincing evidence reporting adaptive variation for physiologically and/or ecologically important traits in marine taxa is often derived from studies comparing field and laboratory observations and based on candidate-gene markers, mainly allozymes, responding to habitat selection. Likewise, patterns of genetic differentiation between sea and lagoon populations of the euryhaline European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) were shown to correlate with changes in allele frequencies recorded during experimental salinity challenges, suggesting potential role for local adaptation. However, there has been criticism of these past approaches, causing a need for further investigation. We reinvestigated this correlation in European sea bass using a set of 20 micro- and one minisatellite markers, some of which are associated with candidate genes. We used rigorous experimental settings to demonstrate that only one single gene-associated marker consistently reported significant genetic differentiation between fish raised in seawater compared to fish acclimated to freshwater (locus EIF3E; F ^sub ST^ = 0.060; p = 0.007, n = 268). A few other loci were shown to be false positive and did not respond to selection. Furthermore, a field study of sea-lagoon differentiation in wild European sea bass (n = 144) using the same loci reported marginally significant genetic differentiation at locus EIF3E (F ^sub ST^ = 0.0114, p = 0.068). This locus was identified as putatively under selection. Two other microsatellite loci associated with genes (DLA0070 and DLA0060, respectively) were found to significantly participate to sea-lagoon differentiation and deviate from neutral expectation. The evidence for sea-lagoon local adaptation in sea bass remains faint if not highly elusive.

T1  - Macrobenthic assemblages, sediment characteristics and heavy metal concentrations in soft-bottom Ebre Delta bays (NW Mediterranean)
AN  - 1650392098
AB  - The spatial distribution of soft-bottom macrofaunal assemblages and their relationship with sediment characteristics were examined in two semi-enclosed shallow-water bays (Alfacs Bay and Fangar Bay) in the Ebre Delta (Catalonia, NW Mediterranean) during 2006 and 2011. Three assemblages were identified: group 1, present in sediments that contain a high percentage of silt-clay, small median particle size and high organic matter content and located at the most external areas of both bays and in the central basin of Alfacs Bay; group 2, present in the shallow northern platform in Alfacs Bay and in both platforms in Fangar Bay, the locations which feature highly variable sediment characteristics; and group 3, present in the shallow areas of both bays, which are characterised by low silt-clay and organic matter content. In Alfacs Bay, the differentiation of these assemblages has persisted since 1987, independently of the increase in organic matter content and heavy metal concentrations and of the shift in macrofaunal composition that have occurred over the past 20 years, most likely the result of increased agricultural activity.

T1  - De Novo Characterisation of the Greenlip Abalone Transcriptome (Haliotis laevigata) with a Focus on the Heat Shock Protein 70 (HSP70) Family
AN  - 1646271221
AB  - Abalone (Haliotis) are economically important molluscs for fisheries and aquaculture industries worldwide. Despite this, genomic resources for abalone and molluscs are still limited. Here we present a description and functional annotation of the greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata) transcriptome. We present a focused analysis on the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) family of genes with putative functions affecting temperature stress and immunity. A total of ~38 million paired end Illumina reads were obtained, resulting in a Trinity assembly of 222,172 contigs with minimum length of 200 base pairs and maximum length of 33 kilobases. The 20,702 contigs were annotated with gene descriptions by BLAST. We created a program to maximise the number of functionally annotated genes, and over 10,000 contigs were assigned Gene ontologies (GO terms). By using CateGOrizer, immunity related GO terms for stressors such as heat, hypoxia, oxidative stress and wounding received the highest counts. Twenty-six contigs with homology to the HSP70 family of genes were identified. Ninety-one putative single-nucleotide polymorphisms were observed in the abalone HSP70 contigs. Eleven of these were considered non-synonymous. The annotated transcriptome described in this study will be a useful basis for future work investigating the genetic response of abalone to stress.

T1  - Abundance and distribution of the rapid expansive coral Oculina patagonica in the Northern Alborán Sea (Western Mediterranean)
AN  - 1826100153
AB  - We describe for the first time the distribution and abundance of Oculina patagonica along the coasts of the Northern Alborán Sea (Andalusia Region, Southern Iberian Peninsula), which corresponds to the southernmost region of the known distribution range of the coral. After surveying 693 km of the Andalusia coastline, along three different depths, we showed that O. patagonica was restricted to the eastern shores of the Alborán Sea. It was only present in 7 out of 195 sampling stations in the eastern region along the studied coasts and at the depth range of 0-3 m. Moreover, we observed that the distribution of the species along the northern coasts of the Alborán Sea might be related to substrate availability and sea surface temperature. In the localities in which its presence was described, the annual mean sea water temperature was in the range of 18-21°C. In relation to substrate availability, it must be noted that the distribution of hard substrata - ideal for O. patagonica settlement and growth - along the sampling area, is not uniform in the study area; this might affect the continuity of the distribution of the species. Local studies such as this one are of importance as a starting point for delineating the species' relationship with its habitat, population boundaries and population ecology. Given the fast expansion of this species along the Mediterranean coasts, this study could serve as a basis for continuous monitoring of the spread of the species and its long-term effects on the ecosystem.

AB  - We assessed population parameters in two populations of mussels, Psoronaias crocodilorum, in the San Pedrito River and the Naranjos River in the Centla Wetlands Biosphere Reserve (CWBR), México. Samples were collected in May 2008, and we determined their density and conducted a morphometric study. For each sample, we measured water depth, temperature, salinity, pH, organic matter and sand, silt and clay percentage. The San Pedrito river bank had a surface of 1200.12m² vs. 562.00m² in Los Naranjos. Shell length in San Pedrito was 21.26-76.16mm vs. 22.20-83.30 in Los Naranjos; the most frequent length in both sites was 58.71-60.11mm. Shell weight averaged 87.43% of the mussels' total weight. MV in San Pedrito was 219.41 g/m² and 81.75 g/m² in Los Naranjos. Density in San Pedrito was 22.90 org/m² and 10.50 org/m² in Los Naranjos. Texture in sediment was loamy sand with 30.17% organic matter in San Pedrito, and 27.43% in Los Naranjos. Physicochemical parameters and the proportion of sand, silt and clay were similar in both sites. None of the mussel banks had biological, ecological or economic features for a fishery, especially due to their low abundance.

T1  - Allee effects and population regulation: a test for biotic resistance against an invasive leafroller by resident parasitoids
AN  - 1668240482
AB  - Issue Title: Including a Special Feature on Unravelling ecological networks: complexity-stability relations and  diversity of interaction types              Resident natural enemies can impact invasive species by causing Allee effects, leading to a reduction in establishment success of small founder populations, or by regulating or merely suppressing the abundance of established populations. Epiphyas postvittana, the Light Brown Apple Moth, an invasive leafroller in California, has been found to be attacked by a large assemblage of resident parasitoids that cause relatively high rates of parasitism. Over a 4-year period, we measured the abundance and per capita growth rates of four E. postvittana populations in California and determined parasitism rates. We found that at two of the sites, parasitism caused a component Allee effect, a reduction in individual survivorship at lower E. postvittana population densities, although it did not translate into a demographic Allee effect, an impact on per capita population growth rates at low densities. Instead, E. postvittana populations at all four sites exhibited strong compensatory density feedback throughout the entire range of densities observed at each site. As we found no evidence for a negative relationship between per capita population growth rates and parasitism rates, we concluded that resident parasitoids were unable to regulate E. postvittana populations in California. Despite a lack of evidence for regulation or a demographic Allee effect, the impact of resident parasitoids on E. postvittana populations is substantial and demonstrates significant biotic resistance against this new invader.

T1  - Effects of salinity on the survival of the Brackwater mussel, Brachidontes virgiliae, in the St Lucia estuarine system, South Africa
AN  - 1638905440
AB  - During drought periods, the razor clam Solen cylindraceus is the dominant bivalve in the St Lucia estuarine system, although restricted to its South Lake region. However, with the recent onset of a wet phase, the mussel Brachidontes virgiliae has become widespread and overwhelmingly dominant throughout the system. The salinity tolerance of B. virgiliae is here determined using both rapid and gradual changes in salinity. Mussels were collected at Esengeni in the Narrows (salinity [asymptotically =] 0) and Lister's Point in False Bay (salinity [asymptotically =] 20). Mortalities were recorded for animals exposed to a sudden change in salinity using 8 different treatments, ranging from 0 to 70. Additionally, animals were exposed to a gradual change in salinity, using treatments that exceeded the minimum and maximum salinities mussels were previously able to tolerate. In all four experiments, animals were able to tolerate salinity levels up to 20. However, a wider salinity tolerance, up to 50, was shown by animals collected from Lister's Point and those gradually acclimated to test conditions. With an increase in flood events predicted for this region, it is imperative to understand how key species may be affected. During wet phases B. virgiliae becomes ubiquitious throughout Lake St Lucia and it is unlikely that the species will disappear from the system, even if floods escalate in the future, as it has an ability to withstand near-freshwater conditions. During dry periods, however, the mussel will be concentrated in the Narrows (oligohaline to limnetic conditions), especially if an inverse salinity gradient with hypersaline conditions prevails within the system.

T1  - Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) filtration, biodeposition, and sediment nitrogen cycling at two oyster reefs with contrasting water quality in Great Bay Estuary (New Hampshire, USA)
AN  - 1634689041
AB  - Benthic deposition of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N)-rich oyster biodeposits may increase denitrification, or anaerobic respiration of nitrate (NO3 ^sup -^) to di-nitrogen gas (N2). However, environmental drivers of C and N dynamics in oyster biodeposits and reef-adjacent sediments require clarification. In July 2012, we collected intact sediment cores adjacent to and 15-20 m away from two oyster reefs (Crassostrea virginica) in Great Bay, New Hampshire, USA: one reference site and one site with cultural eutrophication. We also measured seston, chlorophyll a, and in situ oyster feeding and biodeposition. Cores were incubated in continuous-flow chambers where inflow water received ^sup 15^N-ammonium (NH^sub 4^ ^sup +^), ^sup 15^NO3 ^sup -^, or no isotopes (control). We quantified fluxes of dissolved nutrients and gasses (oxygen, ^sup 28^N2, ^sup 29^N2, ^sup 30^N2, and argon) after 24 h. Finally, we measured size-fractionated sediment organic matter. At the eutrophic site, abundant phytoplankton in the 5-28 µm size range was correlated with enhanced oyster feeding rates and biodeposit quality (lower C:N). This site had greater denitrification rates in reef-adjacent cores relative to distal cores. Low production of ^sup 29,30^N2 in ^sup 15^NH^sub 4^ ^sup +^ amended cores suggested water column or biodeposit NH^sub 4^ ^sup +^ were unlikely to be converted to N2. At both sites, reef-adjacent cores had more shell and higher ^sup 29,30^N2 production with ^sup 15^NO3 ^sup -^ addition relative to distal cores, suggesting direct denitrification enhancement near reefs. Oysters likely increased sediment N2 production via high quality biodeposits (eutrophic site), and NO3 ^sup -^ diffusion via structural complexity of reef-adjacent sediment (both sites). Overall, results suggest oyster-mediated ecosystems services may be expected to vary with environmental conditions.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Review of the leading challenges in maintaining reclaimed water quality during storage and distribution
AN  - 1942762967
AB  - Reclaimed water quality has largely focused on meeting standards in the treated effluent. While the focus is well placed, reclaimed water may change before it is used at dispersed locations. Reclaimed water is a perishable product with a shelf life requiring packaging (i.e., piping) and preserving (with a disinfectant) during storage to minimize deterioration in quality. It typically contains higher nutrient levels compared to potable water. Based on an online survey, the challenges were characterized into nine categories in order of importance: infrastructure, water quality, customer relations, operational, cost (pricing), capacity/supply, regulation, workforce, and miscellaneous. The first five categories accounted for 80% of the challenges raised by the industry. A review of the literature provided various remedies to these challenges which can be incorporated into best management practices for controlling potential health and aesthetic issues associated with storage and distribution of reclaimed water.

T1  - Resistance to desiccation in aquatic invasive snails and implications for their overland dispersal
AN  - 1612826365
AB  - Issue Title: Challenges in Aquatic Sciences              At least 30 species of nonindigenous freshwater snails have invaded North America. The risk of these snails invading new lakes depends upon their ability to survive overland transport. We first reviewed published laboratory experiments using freshwater snails, which show numerous species are able to tolerate days of air exposure. We then tested tolerance to drying of three species of invasive aquatic snails that are widespread in Wisconsin: Bithynia tentaculata, Cipangopaludina chinensis, and Viviparus georgianus. In a series of seven experiments, we simulated boater transport by placing snails individually in mesh bags, hung outdoors, and confined in a screen tent. The screen roof allowed exposure to both sun and rain, and an on-site weather station recorded temperature, precipitation, and humidity. All three species exhibited high survivorship, with some individuals alive at the end of most experiments: 42 days for B. tentaculata and V. georgianus and 63 days for C. chinensis. Viable young were released by C. chinensis after 54 days of exposure. Overall, our results indicate that these invasive snails should readily survive long periods of transport overland, indicating a need for continued vigilance of recreational boaters entering lakes.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - There are multiple stressors derived from urbanizations that result in frequent disturbances on streams and rivers reducing water quality and threatens aquatic biota. P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated multixenobiotic resistance (MXR) is a defence mechanism analogous to multidrug resistance (MDR), which has been demonstrated in several aquatic organisms. This system protects cells against the entry and the accumulation of xenobiotics and has been proposed as a biomarker for pollution assessment. We conducted a study in a post-urban reach of Esquel stream (Chubut Province) downstream a wastewater treatment plant, in order to assess the presence and activity of MXR in five freshwater macroinvertebrate species (Helobdella michaelseni, Helobdella simplex, Patagoniobdella variabilis, Hyalella curvispina and Chironomus riparius). We measured the accumulation of the model P-gp substrate rhodamine B (RB) in organisms previously exposed to pollution. Our results described the activity of the MXR system in the three species of leeches suggesting their suitability as the in vivo biomonitoring. We also identified a dependence of the transporter activity with the development stage in H. simplex, highlighting the importance of using organisms of similar size classes since it may affect observed results. Finally, we concluded that benthic freshwater macroinvertebrates possess different species-specific levels of MXR activity possibly influencing their natural distribution as well as their survival.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Denitrification in a Laurentian Great Lakes coastal wetland invaded by hybrid cattail (Typha × glauca)
AN  - 1562605081
AB  - Wetland ecosystems maintain and improve water quality through the process of denitrification, an increasingly important ecosystem service due to global N pollution. Invasive plants have the potential to disrupt denitrification by altering the environmental conditions that facilitate this process. Great Lakes coastal wetlands are experiencing widespread invasion by highly productive hybrid cattail with largely uncertain biogeochemical effects. Through field and controlled mesocosm studies, we sought to determine the effects of cattail invasion through time on denitrification rates and associated environmental factors in a Great Lakes coastal wetland. In the field, we found that cattail density correlated with increased denitrification and a suite of environmental and plant community characteristics and denitrification rates were positively correlated with NH^sub 4^ ^sup +^, sediment organic matter, reduced water levels, and cattail stand age. Through our controlled mesocosm study, we documented conditions 1- and 5-year following invasion and found that denitrification rates and soil organic matter increased in year 5, and cattail and year-since-invasion altered plant communities and soil NH^sub 4^ ^sup +^. Only a weak correlation between denitrification rates and cattail treatments was noted, however, owing to high replicate variability. Our results indicate that with increasing cattail residence time, one ecosystem service, biodiversity, was negatively impacted, while two other services, denitrification and sediment carbon accumulation, were enhanced. Thus, this highly invaded wetland still provides valuable services to aquatic ecosystems and to society. A holistic perspective is therefore critical when evaluating invasive species impacts in which negative impacts are weighed against other ecosystem services, which may be stimulated.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Voluntary Guidelines to Prevent the Spread of Aquatic Invasive Species Through Recreational Activities
AN  - 1621411685
AB  - In July 2011, the Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force (ANSTF) re-established the Recreational Guidelines Committee (Committee) composed of 55 Federal and State agency, non-profit and industry representatives. The Committee's mission is to update the 2000 ANSTF Recommended Voluntary Guidelines for Preventing the Spread of Aquatic Nuisance Species Associated with Recreational Activities (Federal Register/Vol. 65, No. 76/Thursday, Apr 13, 2000/Notices, Pg. 19,953). Those guidelines were revised taking into account new aquatic invasive species, and new recreational activities and equipment. Guidelines were revised for six recreational activities: anglers, motor boaters, non-motorized boaters, scuba divers and snorkelers, seaplane pilots, and waterfowl hunters.

T1  - Acute toxicity of tralopyril, capsaicin and triphenylborane pyridine to marine invertebrates
AN  - 1552793106; 24994544
AB  - A need for environmentally acceptable alternative antifouling (AF) biocides has arisen through restrictions in the use of many common biocides in the European Union through the Biocidal Product Regulation (Regulation EU No. 528/2012). Three such alternatives are triphenylborane pyridine (TPBP), tralopyril and capsaicin. This study aims at extending the available information on the toxicity of these three emerging AF biocides to key marine invertebrates. Here we investigate the toxicity of tralopyril and capsaicin to the early life stages of the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis and the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus and also of tralopyril, capsaicin and TPBP to the early life stages of the copepod Tisbe battagliai. The EC^sub 50^ that causes abnormal development of mussel's D-veliger larvae and impairs the growth of sea urchin pluteus larvae are respectively 3.1 and 3.0 [mu]g/L for tralopyril and 3,868 and 5,248 [mu]g/L for capsaicin. Regarding the copepod T. battagliai, the LC^sub 50^ was 0.9 [mu]g/L for tralopyril, 1,252 [mu]g/L for capsaicin and 14 [mu]g/L for TPBP. The results obtained for the three substances are compared to a reference AF biocide, tributyltin (TBT), and their ecological risk evaluated. These compounds pose a lower environmental risk than TBT but still, our results suggest that tralopyril and TPBP may represent a considerable threat to the ecosystems.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Bivalves in a bottleneck: taxonomy, phylogeography and conservation of freshwater mussels (Bivalvia: Unionoida) in Australasia
AN  - 1531588252
AB  - Issue Title: Biology and Conservation of Freshwater Bivalves

              
The conservation biology of Australasian freshwater mussels is hindered by lack of a taxonomic framework that employs molecular data as a complement to shell characters, larval forms and internal anatomy. The fauna includes more than 32 known species (30+ Hyriidae, 2 Unionidae), but has not been revised for 55 years, despite minor amendments. The hyriids are relics of Gondwana, represented in Australia and New Guinea by the ancestral Velesunioninae and in Australia and New Zealand by the Hyriinae (Tribe Hyridellini). Many taxonomic and phylogeographic issues await resolution, including the relationships between Australasian and South American species, and between Australian and New Zealand species, and the status of species in New Guinea (including uncertain reports of Unionidae) and the Solomon Islands. Once these are clarified, it will be easier to identify threatened species and evaluate the conservation status of the fauna. At present, only seven taxa are named in the IUCN Red List or under national/state legislation, and these are not representative. Threatening processes include altered flow regimes, catchment disturbances, salinisation, pollution and invasive species. While the need for a taxonomic revision is paramount, progress in conservation may depend also upon involving the wider community.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Multixenobiotic Resistance Mechanism in Gills of Reared vs Wild Mediterranean Mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis
AN  - 1552151177
AB  - Mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis (Lamarck, 1819)) is directly exposed to sea water contamination that elicits significant physiological and cellular response, although its extent mounted in aquaculture-reared in comparison to wild bivalve populations is scarcely known. Therefore, we have compared contamination biomarkers in mussels from reared (Marina farm) and wild, anthropogenically affected site (Vranjic Bay). While predictably, the levels of metals (Cu, Cd, Pb, Zn, Fe, and Hg) in whole bivalve tissues determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry resulted in significantly higher concentrations in wild mussels, accompanied by elevated number of apoptotic cells in gills, the activity of multixenobiotic resistance defense mechanism (MXR), measured as the accumulation rate of model substrate rhodamine B (RB) gave contrasting results. The functional RB assay evidenced a lower MXR efflux activity in the gill tissue of wild mussels, indicating two possible scenarios that will need further focus: 1. persisting sea water pollution increased cell damage of bivalve gill cells and consequently led to leakage of the RB into cytoplasm and dysfunctional MXR efflux in wild mussels, or/and 2. a mixture of different toxic compounds present in Vranjic Bay sea water induced oversaturation of MXR efflux, inducing elevated accumulation of the dye. Consequently, it seems that an efficient physiological functioning of MXR in wild mussels is strongly hampered by existence of an unknown quantity of sea water pollutants that may endanger intrinsic organismal defense system and lead toward the enhancement of toxicity.

T1  - Community structure of epiphytic algae on three different macrophytes at Acarlar floodplain forest (northern Turkey)
AN  - 1543940650
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the species composition, biodiversity and, relative abundance of epiphytic algae and their relationship with environmental variables on three different macrophytes (Nymphaea alba, Ceratophyllum demersum, Typha latifolia ) at Acarlar Floodplain Forest (AFF). Epiphytic algae were gathered monthly by collecting aquatic plants between November 2011 and October 2012, except in winter when there were no plants. In this study, 67 taxa on N. alba, 66 taxa on C. demersum and 66 taxa on T. latifolia were identified as epiphytic algae. The mean value of species richness was 17, that of diversity was 1.5 and that of evenness was 0.54 for epiphytic algae on N. alba, 17, 1.1, and 0.39 on C. demersum, and 18, 1.64, and 0.56 on T. latifolia, respectively. Oscillatoria sp. and Komvophoron crassum (Vozzen) Anagnostidis and Komárek were the most abundant and consistent epiphytic algal species, occurring in high abundance on all macrophytes. Results show that species composition of epiphytic algae was different, but diversity values were similar on all the macrophytes. The hydrological pulse is one of the most important factors determining the physical and chemical environment of the epiphytic algal community. However, substrate type also affected the colonization by F. capucina, O. sancta, P. catenata, and L. truncicola more than the epiphytic algal seasonality.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Predators influence the tidal distribution of oysters (Crassostrea virginica)
AN  - 1539395180
AB  - Biotic and abiotic conditions can separately and synergistically influence the abundance and distribution of species and create vertical zonation patterns in marine systems. In Corpus Christi Bay, TX, USA, eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) are limited to intertidal habitats, while in adjacent estuaries, oysters not only grow subtidally, but thrive in these areas to the extent they are a viable commercial fishery. The purpose of this study was to assess how predators and abiotic conditions affect oyster mortality and growth at different tidal elevations. Anecdotal evidence suggests that abiotic conditions, primarily hypoxia and salinity, as well as oyster disease, limits oysters to intertidal areas. Yet, in Corpus Christi Bay, oysters are absent from subtidal areas where hypoxia is not known to occur. Infection by Perkinsus marinus (Dermo) is common in the study area, but previous work suggests that infection rates do not increase when oysters are transplanted subtidally. We investigated oyster tidal distributions by transplanting newly settled oysters into intertidal and subtidal areas. Predation on oysters was significantly greater in subtidal as compared to intertidal habitats. When protected from predators using cages, oyster survival significantly increased. Further, oysters in subtidal areas allocated significantly more resources to shell growth than did those in intertidal areas, and oysters are known to grow heavier shells in response to predators. Oyster settlement was not statistically different between inter and subtidal areas, and abiotic conditions measured during the study did not exceed known tolerance limits for oysters. Previous studies have shown that abiotic conditions influence oyster mortality and the success of restored oyster reefs. Our findings indicate that predators can also affect oyster distribution, and their effects should be evaluated when developing plans for oyster management and restoration.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Multiscale patterns of genetic structure in a marine snail (Solenosteira macrospira) without pelagic dispersal
AN  - 1539394592
AB  - The northern Gulf of California (NGC) is one of the most dynamic and productive marine ecosystems in the world, yet knowledge about population connectivity and dispersal patterns is lacking for many of its resident species. Using nuclear and mitochondrial markers, we investigated the effects of open water, geographical distance and suitable habitat on patterns of genetic structure of Solenosteira macrospira, a benthic buccinid whelk with direct development. We collected samples in April 2004, 2005 and May 2007 from the upper NGC (31°34.39''N, 114°44.45''W). Phylogenetic analyses, hierarchical analyses of variance and Bayesian assignment tests substantiated a break between the east and west coasts. Genetic distance between population pairs increased with geographical distance, but only when assuming a U-shaped dispersal pathway over the open water of the NGC. Given S. macrospira's association with rocky intertidal habitats, and its limited dispersal potential, we assumed that the geographical distribution of rocky habitat would play a significant role in genetic differentiation of S. macrospira. Nevertheless, populations separated by sand were more similar than populations separated by rocks. The influence of open water, geographical distance and suitable habitat (rocks vs. sand) also varied significantly across different genetic markers that presumably evolve at different rates. Specifically, the more rapidly evolving nuclear microsatellites suggested that physical transport processes strongly influence genetic differentiation on contemporary time scales, even in a species with direct benthic development. This underscores the strong, and potentially homogenizing, effect of present-day ocean circulation patterns in the NGC.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Toxicity of differently sized and coated silver nanoparticles to the bacterium Pseudomonas putida: risks for the aquatic environment?
AN  - 1534711173; 24659347
AB  - Aim of this study was to describe the toxicity of a set of different commercially available silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) to the gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas putida (growth inhibition assay, ISO 10712) in order to contribute to their environmental hazard and risk assessment. Different AgNP sizes and coatings were selected in order to analyze whether those characteristics are determinants of nanoparticle toxicity. Silver nitrate was tested for comparison. In general Pseudomonas putida reacted very sensitive towards the exposure to silver, with an EC^sub 05^ value of 0.043 [mu]g L^sup -1^ for AgNO3 and between 0.13 and 3.41 [mu]g L^sup -1^ for the different AgNPs (EC^sub 50^ values 0.16 [mu]g L^sup -1^ for AgNO3, resp. between 0.25 and 13.4 [mu]g L^sup -1^ for AgNPs). As the ionic form of silver is clearly the most toxic, an environmental hazard assessment for microorganisms based on total silver concentration and the assumption that AgNPs dissolve is sufficiently protective. Neither specific coatings nor certain sizes could be linked to increasing or decreasing toxicity. The characterization of particle behavior as well as the total and dissolved silver content in the medium during the exposures was not possible due to the high sensitivity of Pseudomonas (test concentrations were below detection limits), indicating the need for further development in the analytical domain. Monitored silver concentrations in the aquatic environment span six orders of magnitude (0.1-120,000 ng L^sup -1^), which falls into the span of observed EC^sub 05^ values and might hence indicate a risk to environmental bacteria.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Role of Invasive Green Crabs in the Food Web of an Intertidal Sand Flat Determined from Field Observations and a Dynamic Simulation Model
AN  - 1533625464
AB  - A benthic focussed food web model of intermediate complexity was developed for the intertidal sand flat in the Kejimkujik National Park Seaside, NS, Canada. The goal was to understand the role of invasive green crabs and to investigate potential effects of its removal on the ecosystem. Inputs of biomass, production, consumption and diet composition for each model compartment were obtained through targeted field collections in summers 2008-2010. Simulation (via Ecosim) was used to develop a data-driven baseline steady-state food web of summer conditions and to evaluate effects of ecosystem perturbations that included moderate and extreme removal of crab biomass, in the presence and absence of migrating shorebirds. In the baseline model, green crabs were important benthic predators and also prey for fishes and birds. Ecosystem properties (e.g. size, energetics, organisation) suggested a stable ecosystem. Scenario analyses predicted that crab removal caused only slight perturbations to overall ecosystem properties, but affected some trophic components. Predators that consumed mainly crabs (e.g. gulls) decreased in biomass with crab removal because diet changes could not compensate for lost crab prey. Predators that consumed crabs and also other prey (e.g. plovers) increased in biomass with crab removal because shared benthic prey increased. Migrating shorebirds had a greater impact on the food web than crab removal. Our study suggests that removal of invasive green crabs will likely not drastically change food web biomass and productivity. This study illustrates how field data can be synthesised with food web models for effective management of coastal ecosystems.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Topical advances and recent studies in paleolimnological research
AN  - 2417706887
AB  - Paleolimnology combines the disciplines of limnology, geology and ecology, but because of challenges that separate investigators from direct knowledge about past lake conditions, the field is multidisciplinary by necessity. As a result, paleolimnology is influenced continuously by advances in many disciplines. As with limnological studies in recent decades, paleolimnology has diverged largely from the ecological and theoretical focuses of early investigators, but recent studies demonstrate the need for more integration of ecological and paleolimnological research. This paper provides a brief overview of recent paleolimnological investigations that have addressed questions related to theoretical ecology, as well as applied lake-management and climate research issues. We examine the use of transfer function models for estimating past water-quality conditions, and important caveats expressed by investigators about limitations in the development and use of such models. Paleolimnological research has contributed new insights about biological, physical and chemical processes in lakes that have been subject to change because of climate drivers and anthropogenic influences. These findings are relevant to predicting how lakes will respond to climate change, and will require new management approaches in the future. As the range of paleolimnological studies expands, there will be greater need for basic limnological research in order for paleolimnological investigators to better understand how sediments reflect lake processes of those regions.

T1  - Effect of prey richness on a consumer's intrinsic growth rate
AN  - 1517744145; 24453006
AB  - The intrinsic growth rate of non-selective microbivores increases asymptotically with increasing prey biomass, but we do not know how intrinsic growth rate is affected by prey richness. The objective of this experiment was to determine the effect of prey richness on the growth kinetics of nematode predators while grazing on mixed bacterial lawns. We found that the intrinsic growth rate of Caenorhabditis elegans in laboratory culture increased asymptotically with prey richness. The mechanism of this pattern was primarily due to the best available prey species in the mixture: the intrinsic growth rate of the consumer feeding on a mixture of prey was approximately equal to the intrinsic growth rate of the predator when feeding on the single best prey in monoculture. This was analogous to the selection effect observed in biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships. Generation time, and not reproductive output, was the life history trait component that was most consistent with the pattern of intrinsic growth rate. Our results suggest that in order to link invertebrate consumers' growth rates to their microbial species composition in the field, it will be necessary to determine the ability of microbivorous invertebrates to selectively forage in natural environments and to better understand the micro-scale distribution of microbial communities in their natural environments.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Contrasting energy pathways at the community level as a consequence of regime shifts
AN  - 1517744061; 24414311
AB  - Ecological regime shifts typically result in abrupt changes in ecosystem structure through several trophic levels, which leads to rapid ecosystem reconfiguration between regimes. An interesting aspect of the impact of regime shift is that alternative regimes may induce distinct shifts in energy pathways; these have been less tested than structural changes. This paper addresses this by using stable isotopes to establish the energy pathways in fish communities. We specifically focus on the impact of regime shift on changes of the energy pathways, and how the magnitude and direction of these changes affect the local community. We found that energy pathways significantly varied among the planktivorous, benthivorous, and piscivorous trophic guilds as a result of the alternative regimes. The regime shift from a clear to a turbid state altered the food web towards planktonic energy pathways and truncated food chain length, which is indicative of less ecological efficiency. This was confirmed by the adaptive foraging strategies of prevalent omnivores in the current communities. These structural and functional characteristics of trophic interactions might not facilitate classic trophic cascading effects in such a turbid regime and suppress the system's response to environmental changes, e.g., nutrient loading, and restoration efforts in turbid to clear water regime shifts.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Trophic Links in the Plankton in the Low Salinity Zone of a Large Temperate Estuary: Top-down Effects of Introduced Copepods
AN  - 1516363612
AB  - We investigated trophic relationships involving microzooplankton in the low salinity zone of the San Francisco Estuary (SFE) as part of a larger effort aimed at understanding the dynamics of the food web supporting the endangered delta smelt, Hypomesus transpacificus. We performed 14 cascade experiments in which we manipulated the biomass of a copepod (Limnoithona tetraspina, Pseudodiaptomus forbesi, or Acartiella sinensis) and quantified responses of lower trophic levels including bacterioplankton, phytoplankton, and microzooplankton. Microzooplankton comprised a major food source for copepods; 9 out of 14 experiments showed removal of at least one group of microzooplankton by copepods. In contrast, the impact of copepods on phytoplankton was indirect; increased copepod biomass led to greater growth of phytoplankton in 3 of 14 experiments. Estimated clearance rates on microzooplankton were 4 mL day^sup -1^ for L. tetraspina and 2-6 mL day^sup -1^ for P. forbesi, whereas A. sinensis consumed mainly copepod nauplii. Complex trophic interactions, including omnivory, among copepods, microzooplankton, and different components of the phytoplankton likely obscured clear trends. The food web of the SFE is probably less efficient than previously thought, providing poor support to higher trophic levels; this inefficient food web is almost certainly implicated in the continuing low abundance of fishes, including the delta smelt that use the low salinity zone of the San Francisco Estuary.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Bioaccumulation of selected metals in bivalves (Unionidae) and Phragmites australis inhabiting a municipal water reservoir
AN  - 1511169607; 24407963
AB  - Urbanization can considerably affect water reservoirs by, inter alia, input, and accumulation of contaminants including metals. Located in the course of River Cybina, Maltaski Reservoir (Western Poland) is an artificial shallow water body built for recreation and sport purposes which undergoes restoration treatment (drainage) every 4 years. In the present study, we demonstrate an accumulation of nine metals (Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn) in water, sediment, three bivalve species (Anodonta anatina, Anodonta cygnea, Unio tumidus), and macrophyte Phragmites australis collected before complete drainage in November 2012. The mean concentrations of metals in the sediment, bivalves, and P. australis (roots and leaves) decreased in the following order: Fe > Mn > Zn > Cu > Cr > Ni > Pb > Co > Cd. A considerably higher bioconcentration of metals was observed in samples collected from the western and southern sites which undergo a higher degree of human impact. Sediments were found to be a better indicator of metal contamination than water samples. Interspecific differences in levels of metal accumulation were found between investigated unionids. U. tumidus accumulated higher levels of Cr, positively correlated with ambient concentrations, predisposing this species as a potential bioindicator of this metal in aquatic environments. On the other hand, species of Anodonta genus demonstrated higher accumulation of Cu and Cd. Positive correlations were found between Pb content in the sediments and tissues of all three bivalve species. In P. australis, metals were largely retained in roots except for Cd and Pb for which higher concentrations were found in leaves suggesting additional absorption of these metals from aerial sources. P. australis and bivalve from the Maltaski Reservoir may be a potential source of toxic metals for animals feeding upon them and contribute to further contamination in the food chain.

T1  - Viewing Marine Bacteria, Their Activity and Response to Environmental Drivers from Orbit: Satellite Remote Sensing of Bacteria
AN  - 1509394347; 24477922
AB  - Satellite-based remote sensing of marine microorganisms has become a useful tool in predicting human health risks associated with these microscopic targets. Early applications were focused on harmful algal blooms, but more recently methods have been developed to interrogate the ocean for bacteria. As satellite-based sensors have become more sophisticated and our ability to interpret information derived from these sensors has advanced, we have progressed from merely making fascinating pictures from space to developing process models with predictive capability. Our understanding of the role of marine microorganisms in primary production and global elemental cycles has been vastly improved as has our ability to use the combination of remote sensing data and models to provide early warning systems for disease outbreaks. This manuscript will discuss current approaches to monitoring cyanobacteria and vibrios, their activity and response to environmental drivers, and will also suggest future directions.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Differences in dispersal- and colonization-related traits between taxa from the freshwater and the terrestrial realm
AN  - 1499455155
AB  - The aquatic and terrestrial realms differ in many physical properties that not only require specific physiological adaptations but also cause differences in dispersal options. We thus expect that life-history traits related to dispersal and colonization are under selection pressure because freshwater habitats are more isolated and thus more difficult to reach. We compared traits from European databases of three taxonomic groups along the passive-active dispersal gradient: plants (Plantes), snails (Mollusca: Gastropoda: Prosobranchia et Pulmonata) and hoverflies (Diptera: Syrphidae), all of which have both terrestrial and freshwater species (plants and snails) or early life stages (hoverflies). Aquatic taxa seem to be more successful long-distance dispersers than are terrestrial taxa. Our analysis also revealed lower numbers of seeds or eggs produced in the aquatic habitats. However, aquatic taxa often allocate resources to offspring guarding (vegetative propagules in plants, egg capsules in snails) and breeding-site selection (syrphids). Colonization of the aquatic realm is reinforced by increases in life span (plants), clonal spread (plants), shorter generation times (snails), selfing ability (marginal effect in pulmonate snails) or paedogenesis (two incidences in hoverflies, needs further studies). Probably, the variety of strategies reflects the different evolutionary backgrounds that elicit different combinations of trade-offs, but all traits also might increase invasibility of species.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Biota as toxic metal indicators
AN  - 1497149591
AB  - Metal in the environment arises from both natural sources and human activities. Toxic metals in air, soil, and water have become a global problem. They are potential hazards to aquatic, animal, and human life because of their toxicity, bioaccumulative, and non-biodegradable nature. The major impacts of metal pollutants can be stated as ecosystem contamination and health problems of exposed human populations. Those problems have been a cause of increasing public concern throughout the world. Some trace metals are used by living organisms to stabilize protein structures, facilitate electron transfer reactions, and catalyze enzymatic reactions. But even metals that are biologically essential can be harmful to living organisms at high levels of exposure. An increasing concentration of heavy metals in the environment can modify mineral and enzyme functions of human beings. During the last two decades, the interest in using bioindicators as monitoring tools to assess environmental pollution with toxic metals has increased. Bioindicators are flora and fauna members, which are collected and analyzed to measure the levels of metal contaminants. Bioindicators therefore identify health hazards. Various living organisms, such as microbes, fungi, plants, animals, and humans, are used to monitor toxic metals from air, water, sediment, soil, and food chain. Here, we review recent bioindicators, toxicity assessment, and ecological effects.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Water pollutant monitoring with aquatic bryophytes: a review
AN  - 1497149104
AB  - Bryophytes are non-vascular plants with large biomass and high production level in freshwaters. Aquatic bryophytes are used to assess the ecological status. They are a stress-tolerant group, and many species have a wide trophic range. Aquatic bryophytes are used as indicators by the presence or absence of a pollutant, or as monitors to measure pollutant concentrations. Here, we review major advances in bryomonitoring from a range of countries, mainly in Europe. Monitored elements include Ba, Cd, Cr, Cu, Co, Ni, Pb, Zn, Fe, Mn, V, ^sup 137^Cs, ^sup 134^Cs, ^sup 235^U, ^sup 236^Ra, ^sup 232^Th and ^sup 40^K. We illustrate the advantages of low-cost methods for monitoring water quality. Biomonitoring includes (1) passive observation and analysis of native bryophytes and (2) active biomonitoring based on species transplantation for a fixed exposure period. Two widespread northern hemisphere aquatic mosses, Fontinalis antipyretica and Platyhypnidium riparioides, are the most common biomonitors.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Biomonitoring toxicity of natural sediments using juvenile Hyalella curvispina (Amphipoda) as test species: evaluation of early effect endpoints
AN  - 1496874210; 24414854
AB  - The utility of early effect endpoints as biomarkers of ecotoxicity of natural sediments in water-sediment static system was investigated. The particular goal was to evaluate the ecotoxicity of the sediment samples from La Choza stream, located in upper basin of the Reconquista river, the second most polluted river of Argentina. Native juveniles Hyalella curvispina were used as test organisms evaluating survival, growth, oxidative stress parameters (SOD; CAT, TBARS) and the electron transport system (ETS) activity as early toxic effect. This study used methodologies and techniques that allow the assessment of sediment pollution with a native species as test organism and provided data to discuss the viability of sublethal endpoints as tools for freshwater sediment assessment. In spring and in summer two ten-day series of whole-sediment assays were conducted simultaneously: (a) standard assays and (b) biomarkers assays. A control sediment was ran simultaneously in which no--effect on survival was measured. In summer there was a significant increase in length and biomass in both exposed and control groups. In spring an inhibitory effect on growth and an increase in oxidative damage with a concomitant rise in antioxidant defenses, was observed in animals exposed to La Choza sediment. ETS measurement indicated a significant depression of metabolic activity of amphipods exposed to contaminated sediments. The measured biomarkers represent the first record for juvenile H. curvispina exposed to polluted natural sediments under standardized laboratory conditions. The used bioanalytical tools demonstrated higher sensitivity and a more accurate assessment of the effects than those obtained by the standard tests of survival and growth. We propose their adoption in biomonitoring of freshwater sediment toxicity.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Effect of land use on pollution status and risk of fish endocrine disruption in small farmland ponds
AN  - 1462483988
AB  - Issue Title: Understanding the role of ponds in a changing world

              
To study whether the intensity of agricultural activities affects pesticides loads in pond environment, a large number of Belgian farmland ponds were surveyed in spring 2004. Temporal distribution of pollutants was also investigated over restricted survey ponds sampled three times round year 2007. Sedentary pond Prussian carp juveniles were also captured to determine their brain aromatase activity (AA) and plasma vitellogenin (VTG) levels. Heavy metal distribution was also examined in various pond matrices. Amongst the pesticides analysed, only herbicides were detected. Contamination of pond water by atrazine was frequently observed during spring 2004, while isoproturon and glyphosate were detected round year 2007. Levels of herbicides were inversely related to the distance of ponds to crop field, and values peaked in April or October. Absence of endocrine disruptors in pond water was confirmed by lack of modulation in VTG and AA in male fish. Heavy metals were present in all the pond matrices, but overall contamination levels were low. The results demonstrated that Belgian ponds were mainly contaminated by herbicides and that pond sedentary fish were not affected by endocrine disruptors. They also demonstrated a marked effect of land-use intensity on herbicide pollution which can be mitigated by an adjustment of the buffer zones.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT] Erratum DOI: 10.1007/s10750-013-1689-0

T1  - Community structure and decadal changes in macrozoobenthic assemblages in Lake Poyang, the largest freshwater lake in China
AN  - 1762722416
AB  - Lake Poyang is the largest freshwater lake in China and contains unique and diverse biota within the Yangtze floodplain ecosystem. However, knowledge of its macrozoobenthic assemblages remains inadequate. To characterize the current community structure of these assemblages and to portray their decadal changes, quarterly investigations were conducted at 15 sites from February to November 2012. A total of 42 taxa were recorded, and Corbicula fluminea, Limnoperna fortunei, Gammaridae sp., Nephtys polybranchia, Polypedilum scalaenum and Branchiura sowerbyi were found to dominate the community in terms of abundance. The bivalves Corbicula fluminea, Lamprotula rochechouarti, Arconaia lanceolata and Lamprotula caveata dominated the community in biomass due to their large body size. The mean abundance of the total macrozoobenthos varied from 48 to 920 ind·m-2, the mean biomass ranged from 28 to 428 g·m-2. The substrate type affected strongly the abundance, biomass, and diversity of the macrozoobenthos, with muddy sand substrates showing the highest values. Compared with historical data, remarkable changes were observed in the abundance of macrozoobenthos and the identity of the dominant species. The mean total abundance decreased from 724 ind·m-2 in 1992 to 228 ind·m-2 in 2012. The dominant species have shifted dramatically. Large unionids were dominant before 1998, whereas pollution-tolerant species (e.g., Branchiura sowerbyi) increased in dominance after 2008. Our findings should have implications for the conservation of the benthic biodiversity of this large Yangtze-connected lake.
Le lac Poyang est le plus grand lac d’eau douce en Chine et contient des biotes uniques et diversifiés de l’écosystème de la plaine inondable du Yangtzé. Cependant, la connaissance de ses assemblages macrozoobenthiques reste insuffisante. Pour caractériser la structure de la communauté actuelle de ces assemblages et présenter leurs changements décennaux, des inventaires trimestriels ont été menés dans 15 sites de février à novembre 2012. Un total de 42 taxons ont été enregistrés, et Corbicula fluminea, Limnoperna fortunei, Gammaridae sp., Nephtys polybranchia, Polypedilum scalaenum, et Branchiura sowerbyi ont été trouvés dominant la communauté en termes d’abondance. Les bivalves Corbicula fluminea, Lamprotula rochechouarti, Arconaia lanceolata et Lamprotula caveata dominent la communauté en biomasse en raison de leur grande taille. L’abondance moyenne du total du macrozoobenthos varie de 48 à 920 ind·m-2, la biomasse moyenne varie de 28 à 428 g·m-2. Le type de substrat affecte fortement l’abondance, la biomasse et la diversité du macrozoobenthos, avec des substrats de sable boueux montrant les valeurs les plus élevées. En comparaison avec les données historiques, des changements remarquables ont été observés dans l’abondance du macrozoobenthos et l’identité des espèces dominantes. L’abondance totale moyenne a diminué de 724 ind·m-2 en 1992 à 228 ind·m-2 en 2012. Les espèces dominantes ont changé de façon spectaculaire. Les grands unionidés étaient dominants avant 1998, alors que les espèces tolérantes à la pollution (par exemple, Branchiura sowerbyi) ont augmenté en importance après 2008. Nos résultats devraient avoir des implications pour la conservation de la biodiversité benthique de ce grand lac connecté au Yangtzé.

T1  - Nuisance species: beyond the ecological perspective
AN  - 1652857132
AB  - 'Nuisance species' (or 'invasive' species) are often proposed to be the second most important concern in the context of the current biodiversity crisis. Despite increasing evidence that exotic species do not always become invasive, this perception is still common in the scientific community. This suggests that other issues are at stake in the concept of nuisance species rather than just the problems they raise, grounded mostly in ecological or economic arguments.

              
We retraced the evolution of pigeon representation in France through an extensive review of ancient texts related to pigeons and reviewed more than 240 source texts, dating from the seventh century to the 1990s. We completed these data with literature on human-animal relationships and animal conceptions in religious, philosophical, scientific, and political currents of thought that were representative of Western and, specifically, French tradition.

              
We used the heated debate over pigeons (Columba livia) as pests as a case study by analyzing the ecological, social, economic, and political relations regarding pigeons. Through a historical perspective of the debate about and understanding of pigeons, we propose a new and complementary explanation for the modern thinking of pigeons as a nuisance species, based on what we termed their socio-nature characteristics. In particular, we used social representations theory to highlight the issues of human identity construction at stake in the construction of pigeons as a nuisance species.

              
We invite the reader to consider the impact of such human self-definition on environmental stances, as it could constrain further developments or improvements of conservation perspectives.

T1  - Covarying Shell Growth Parameters and the Regulation of Shell Shape in Marine Bivalves: A Case Study on Tellinoidea
AN  - 1547921472
AB  - Specific parameters characterising shell shape may arguably have a significant role in the adaptation of bivalve molluscs to their particular environments. Yet, such functionally relevant shape parameters (shell outline elongation, dissymmetry, and ventral convexity) are not those parameters that the animal may directly control. Rather than shell shape, the animal regulates shell growth. Accordingly, an alternative, growth-based description of shell-shape is best fitted to understand how the animal may control the achieved shell shape. The key point is, in practice, to bring out the link between those two alternative modes of shell-shape descriptions, that is, to derive the set of equations which connects the growth-based shell-shape parameters to the functionally relevant shell-shape parameters. Thus, a preliminary object of this note is to derive this set of equations as a tool for further investigations. A second object of this work is to provide an illustrative example of implementation of this tool. I report on an unexpected negative covariance between growth-based parameters and show how this covariance results in a severe limitation of the range of interspecific variability of the degree of ventral convexity of the shell outline within the superfamily Tellinoidea. Hypotheses are proposed regarding the constraints possibly at the origin of this limitation of interspecific variability.

T1  - Vulnerability and diet breadth predict larval and adult parasite diversity in fish of the Bothnian Bay
AN  - 1475028541; 24026499
AB  - Recent studies of aquatic food webs show that parasite diversity is concentrated in nodes that likely favour transmission. Various aspects of parasite diversity have been observed to be correlated with the trophic level, size, diet breadth, and vulnerability to predation of hosts. However, no study has attempted to distinguish among all four correlates, which may have differential importance for trophically transmitted parasites occurring as larvae or adults. We searched for factors that best predict the diversity of larval and adult endoparasites in 4105 fish in 25 species studied over a three-year period in the Bothnian Bay, Finland. Local predator-prey relationships were determined from stomach contents, parasites, and published data in 8,229 fish in 31 species and in seals and piscivorous birds. Fish that consumed more species of prey had more diverse trophically transmitted adult parasites. Larval parasite diversity increased with the diversity of both prey and predators, but increases in predator diversity had a greater effect. Prey diversity was more strongly associated with the diversity of adult parasites than with that of larvae. The proportion of parasite species present as larvae in a host species was correlated with the diversity of its predators. There was a notable lack of association with the diversity of any parasite guild and fish length, trophic level, or trophic category. Thus, diversity is associated with different nodal properties in larval and adult parasites, and association strengths also differ, strongly reflecting the life cycles of parasites and the food chains they follow to complete transmission.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - The aim of the present study was to estimate critical body residues (CBRs) of three metals [cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), chromium (Cr)] in the aquatic oligochaete Tubifex tubifex based on lethal (LBR) and sublethal effects (CBR), and to discuss the relevance of the exposure to sediment for deriving CBR. Toxicity parameters (LC^sub 50^, EC^sub 50^, LBR^sub 50^ and CBR^sub 50^) were estimated for each metal by means of data on survival and on several sublethal variables measured in short-term (4 days), water-only exposures and in long-term, chronic (14 and 28 days) exposures using metal-spiked sediment. Sublethal endpoints included autotomy in short-term exposure, as well as reproduction and growth in chronic bioassays. LBR^sub 50^ and CBR^sub 50^ were 3-6 times higher in sediment than in water-only exposure to Cd and about 2-11 times higher for Cu, depending on the measured endpoint; however, for Cr these parameters varied only by a factor of 1.2. Cu and Cr LBR^sub 50^ and CBR^sub 50^ values in 96 h water-only exposure were very similar (survival 2.39 [mu]mol Cu g^sup -1^ dw, 2.73 [mu]mol Cr g^sup -1^ dw; autotomy 0.53 [mu]mol Cu g^sup -1^ dw, 0.78 [mu]mol Cr g^sup -1^ dw). However, in metal-spiked sediments, 28 d CBR^sub 50^ values for autotomy, reproduction and growth ranged 6.76-29.54 [mu]mol g^sup -1^ dw for Cd, 3.88-6.23 [mu]mol g^sup -1^ dw for Cu, 0.65 [mu]mol g^sup -1^ dw for Cr (calculated only on total number of young). Exposure conditions (time and presence/absence of sediment) seem to be influential in deriving metal CBR values of Cd and Cu, while appear to be irrelevant for Cr. Thus, CBR approach for metals is complex and tissue residue-toxicity relationship is not directly applicable so far.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Biodiversity in Mediterranean-climate streams of California
AN  - 1439196916
AB  - Issue Title: Streams in mediterranean climate regions: lessons learned from the last decade              Although the California mediterranean climate region is widely considered a biodiversity hotspot for terrestrial plants and vertebrates, freshwater biodiversity in this region is generally not well known. Using information from museum specimen databases, published literature, biological assessment surveys, and specialist's knowledge, we review freshwater biodiversity for several groups of stream organisms in the med-climate region of California, which includes 2,220 species in 292 families. The groups with the highest diversity of lotic species are aquatic insects and diatoms, which comprise 39 and 36 % of species in our lists, respectively. Sequential floods and drying periods limit the overall biodiversity of many stream organisms in California mediterranean rivers, and continued climate and land-use change may cause disproportionate biodiversity declines in the region. However, only 4 % of lotic species have been evaluated in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, and many assessments are outdated. Future development of online databases for botanical and zoological collections will significantly enhance biodiversity and distribution knowledge. This information will enable us to more accurately and efficiently assess the effects of global change on biodiversity of freshwater organisms, to evaluate conservation status of individual taxa, and to set conservation priorities for stream ecosystems.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Water management in mediterranean river basins: a comparison of management frameworks, physical impacts, and ecological responses
AN  - 1439196876
AB  - Issue Title: Streams in mediterranean climate regions: lessons learned from the last decade

              
Rivers in mediterranean climates have been extensively modified by water management infrastructure and practices, yet patterns of development and consequent effects on freshwater ecosystems have not been compared across multiple regions. To evaluate the influence of water management on mediterranean-climate rivers, we compare the historic progression of management policies, institutions, and ecosystem impacts in the Sacramento River (California, USA), Ebro River (Spain), and Biobío River (Chile) basins. There are broad similarities in patterns of ecosystem alterations related to the extensive development of dams and water management infrastructure in the three study basins. Flow regimes have been altered by the reduction of winter peak flows and increased summer baseflows. There are also common patterns of disturbance from sediment transport alteration, water quality degradation, and declines in freshwater biodiversity. Current approaches are inadequate for addressing the formidable water management challenges in California, Spain, and Chile, yet the dramatic evolution of water policies and institutions over the past 150 years suggests that further adaptation is possible. Advances toward integrated and sustainable water management models are likely to occur through incremental change, driven by growing awareness of climate change effects and public demands for water-use efficiency and improved environmental quality.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Freshwater biodiversity in the rivers of the Mediterranean Basin
AN  - 1439196820
AB  - Issue Title: Streams in mediterranean climate regions: lessons learned from the last decade              We review the diversity of freshwater organisms in the Mediterranean Basin (hereafter Med), particularly from streams and rivers. We present available information on the richness, endemicity, and distribution of each freshwater organism group within the Med, and make a comparison with Palearctic diversity. Approximately 35% of known Palearctic freshwater species and more than 6% of the World's freshwater species are present in the Med. A high degree of endemicity is found in the Med freshwater biota. These data, together with the degree to which many freshwater species are threatened, support the inclusion of the Med among World biodiversity hotspots. Nevertheless, knowledge of Med biodiversity is still incomplete, particularly for some taxa. Regarding to the spatial distribution of species within the Med, the richest area is the North, although patterns differ among groups. A comparison of the ecological and biological traits of endemic and non-endemic species of three riverine groups (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera) revealed that endemic species have several strategies and mechanisms to face typical mediterranean-climate conditions, such as drought, when compared to non-endemic species. We briefly analyse the conservation status of the region's biodiversity. Finally, we present some future challenges regarding the knowledge and protection of Med freshwater biodiversity.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The effect of glyphosate-based herbicide on aquatic organisms - a case study
AN  - 1493423949
AB  - The non-selective, post-emergence herbicides based on glyphosate [N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine] are one of the most widely used pesticides in agriculture, urban areas and forestry. Although there has been documentation on the physical, chemical and toxicological properties of glyphosate, the aquatic toxicity of such formulations still requires assessment and evaluation. In the present study, we describe deliberate use of glyphosate-based herbicide in a bathing area of Lake Lednica (Wielkopolska, Poland) by unknown perpetrators in April, 2011. Glyphosate was detected using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in the water samples collected from the bathing area at a mean concentration of 0.09 mg dm-3. Aboveground parts of emerged macrophytes (Phragmites australis and Typha latifolia) covering the investigated area were completely withered. Studies of benthic macroinvertebrates revealed no significant differences in taxa number between event (13 taxa) and control (14 taxa) sites although differences in abundance of particular taxa were observed. Significantly lower numbers of Chironomidae (by 41%), Oligochaeta (by 43%), Vivipariae (by 75%), Hirudinae (by 75%), Asellus aquaticus (by 77%), Gammarus pulex (by 38%) and Dreissena polymorpha (by 42%) were found at the glyphosate-treated site. Furthermore, compared to the control, chironomids (Chironomidae) exposed to glyphosate were represented by specimens smaller in length while A. aquaticus only showed large adults. The ranges of glyphosate concentration in the tissues of sampled macroinvertebrates and Phragmites australis organs were 7.3-10.2 μg kg-1 and 16.2-24.7 μg kg-1, respectively. Our study indicates that glyphosate-based herbicides may have adverse effects on aquatic organisms including macroinvertebrates, thus their use in (or nearby) surface waters should be subject to strict limitation.

T1  - Carbamazepine-mediated pro-oxidant effects on the unicellular marine algal species Dunaliella tertiolecta and the hemocytes of mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis
AN  - 1437144850; 23912321
AB  - This study investigates the pro-oxidant behavior of the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine (CBZ) on the marine algal species Dunaliella tertiolecta and the immune defense-related hemocytes of mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. A phytotoxicity test, performed in a first step, showed a significant inhibition of the growth rate and the chlorophyll alpha (Chl-[alpha]) content in algae after exposure for 24 h to different concentrations of CBZ (1-200 mg L^sup -1^). On the other hand, the increased levels of lipid peroxidation products, such as MDA, measured in 24 h CBZ-treated cells were attenuated with time (48-96 h), followed by a significant recovery of both the algal growth rate and the Chl-[alpha] content in all cases. The latter could be related to the concomitant enhancement of total carotenoids in CBZ-treated algae with time, which in turn could protect algal growth and survival against CBZ-induced oxidative stress. On the other hand, the increased levels of cell death, superoxide anions (^sup ·^O2 ^sup -^), nitric oxides (NO, in terms of nitrites, NO2 ^sup -^) and MDA content observed in mussel hemocytes exposed to environmentally relevant (0.01-1 [mu]g L^sup -1^) and/or higher (10 and 100 [mu]g L^sup -1^) concentrations of the drug, clearly indicate the ability of CBZ to induce oxidative effects on cells of non-target species, such as mussels, affecting thus their overall health status. The significant relationships occurred among the tested biological parameters in both bioassays, further reinforce CBZ-mediated pro-oxidant effects on species, widely used in ecotoxicological and toxicological studies and provide a more comprehensive view on its environmental fate and ecotoxicological risk evaluation.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Cascading effects of flow reduction on the benthic invertebrate community in a lowland river
AN  - 1434120254
AB  - Reduction of flow constitutes one of the most severe human alterations to rivers, as it affects the key abiotic feature of these ecosystems. While there has been considerable progress in understanding the effects of reduced flow on benthic macroinvertebrates, cascading effects of flow reduction on dissolved oxygen concentrations (DO) have not yet received much attention. We compared the macroinvertebrate composition between reference conditions and a situation after several years of discharge reduction in the Spree River (Brandenburg, Germany). Community composition shifted from rheophilic species to species indifferent to flow conditions. Filter feeders were partially replaced by collector/gatherers, which likely reduces the retention of organic matter, and thus the self-purification capacity of the river section. These shifts were associated with low discharge during summer, cascading into daily DO concentration minima of less than 5 mg l^sup -1^ which prevailed 74% of the days in summer. This depletion of DO after flow reduction presumably caused the observed species turnover. Hence, flow reduction in lowland rivers may not only directly impair the ecological functions provided by benthic macroinvertebrates but may also act indirectly by depleting DO concentrations.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Which are, what is their status and what can we expect from ecosystem services provided by Spanish rivers and riparian areas?
AN  - 1433222083
AB  - By applying the framework proposed by Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, we analysed the current state and trends of 20 ecosystem services provided by Spanish rivers and riparian areas using 139 indicators. We compared the obtained results with the Europe and UK assessment. It is the first document that attempts to analyse the importance of services provided by Spanish rivers and riparian areas, and it forms part of the evaluation carried out for the Spanish Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. Among the provisioning services, freshwater, hydropower energy and genetic resources were classified as high importance, and water regulation and self-purification capacity, and natural hazard mitigation are among the regulating services, with landscape-aesthetic values and recreation and ecotourism featuring among the cultural services. About 61 % of the assessed ecosystem services are currently declining or degrading, but are higher than the percentage calculated for Europe (45 %) or for the UK (53 %). All regulating services are degrading, especially water regulation, natural hazard mitigation, soil formation and fertility and biological control, and the cultural services related to rural populations. Likewise, the biodiversity of Spanish aquatic ecosystems is decreasing rapidly. Land use changes and overexploitation of biological and mineral raw materials have been the main direct drivers of change in Spanish rivers and riparian zones, and relate directly to increase urbanised areas and irrigated agriculture. Finally, we draw some considerations on alternative models for aquatic ecosystems management which maintain aquatic ecosystem services and their biodiversity.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Cephalopods as Vectors of Harmful Algal Bloom Toxins in Marine Food Webs
AN  - 1536901455
AB  - Here we summarize the current knowledge on the transfer and accumulation of harmful algal bloom (HAB)-related toxins in cephalopods (octopods, cuttlefishes and squids). These mollusks have been reported to accumulate several HAB-toxins, namely domoic acid (DA, and its isomers), saxitoxin (and its derivatives) and palytoxin (and palytoxin-like compounds) and, therefore, act as HAB-toxin vectors in marine food webs. Coastal octopods and cuttlefishes store considerably high levels of DA (amnesic shellfish toxin) in several tissues, but mainly in the digestive gland (DG)-the primary site of digestive absorption and intracellular digestion. Studies on the sub-cellular partitioning of DA in the soluble and insoluble fractions showed that nearly all DA (92.6%) is found in the cytosol. This favors the trophic transfer of the toxins since cytosolic substances can be absorbed by predators with greater efficiency. The available information on the accumulation and tissue distribution of DA in squids (e.g., in stranded Humboldt squids, Dosidicus gigas) is scarcer than in other cephalopod groups. Regarding paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs), these organisms accumulate them at the greatest extent in DG >> kidneys > stomach > branchial hearts > posterior salivary glands > gills. Palytoxins are among the most toxic molecules identified and stranded octopods revealed high contamination levels, with ovatoxin (a palytoxin analogue) reaching 971 μg kg-1 and palytoxin reaching 115 μg kg-1 (the regulatory limit for PlTXs is 30 μg kg-1 in shellfish). Although the impacts of HAB-toxins in cephalopod physiology are not as well understood as in fish species, similar effects are expected since they possess a complex nervous system and highly developed brain comparable to that of the vertebrates. Compared to bivalves, cephalopods represent a lower risk of shellfish poisoning in humans, since they are usually consumed eviscerated, with exception of traditional dishes from the Mediterranean area.

AB  - The schooners were part of an American squadron waiting out the night to do battle with a nearby British Royal Navy squadron.  Since the outbreak of the War of 1812 a year earlier, both squadrons had vied for control of the strategically important Lake Ontario.  In April 2007, the UAS completed a side scan sonar survey of the study area from its survey boat Red Bay using an L-3 Klein (Salem, New Hampshire) 3000 dual-frequency (132 and 445 kilohertz) system with an armored tow cable, a 3PS Inc. (Cedar Park, Texas) metering sheave block for layback control, NovAtel Inc. (Calgary, Canada) ProPak mapping-grade Canada-wide differential GPS service (CDGPS) receiver for positioning, and HYPACK Inc. (Middletown, Connecticut) Max for navigation control.

T1  - Long-term dynamics of phosphorus in the Narochanskie Lakes and factors determining it
AN  - 1434119244
AB  - The Narochanskie Lakes (Batorino, Myastro, and Naroch) (Belarus) are a focus of many-year hydroecological studies. The modern evolution of the ecosystem of the lakes includes four stages: anthropogenic eutrophication in the 1970s, de-eutrophication because of nature protection measures in their drainage area in the 1980s, benthification because of invasion of mollusk-filterer Dreissena polymorpha Pallas in the 1990s, and the present-day state. Retrospective analysis of many-year dynamics of total phosphorus (1978-2010) in water of the Narochanskie Lakes is given for different stages of their ecosystems restructuring. The complex response of water bodies comprising a single ecosystem to external impacts is described and its causes are discussed.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Controlling factors of phytoplankton seasonal succession in oligotrophic Mali Ston Bay (south-eastern Adriatic)
AN  - 1413403891; 23417779
AB  - Fine spatial and temporal phytoplankton variability in Mali Ston Bay has been observed for the first time based on physicochemical properties and small herbivorous zooplankton. Extensive year-through research was conducted during 2002 at Usko station which is traditionally an area of intensive shellfish farming. The Neretva River inflow, submarine springs (vruljas) and precipitation are additional sources of nutrients in the bay. Temperature and salinity, combined with total inorganic nitrogen (TIN) were observed to be the most important environmental factors driving the succession of phytoplankton communities. Orthophosphate was a potential limiting factor for phytoplankton development. The nanophytoplankton abundances, as well as the microphytoplankton diatoms are controlled by herbivorous zooplankton grazing ('top-down' control) more than other groups of microphytoplankton. Nanophytoplankton dominated phytoplankton abundance and its most intensive development was recorded in winter and spring, while increase in microphytoplankton abundance occurred in spring and autumn. Diatoms dominated microphytoplankton abundance mostly in winter and autumn, while dinoflagellates dominated in spring and summer. Considering the number of taxa and abundance, dinoflagellates were the dominant microphytoplankton group during the year and were the main component of the spring blooms. At that time, in conditions of elevated temperature (>16 °C), decreased salinity (34-36) and increased concentrations of TIN, blooms of harmful dinoflagellate Prorocentrum minimum were recorded for the first time in the bay. The results showed a significant difference in environmental conditions, as well as in the annual phytoplankton succession and community structure, as compared with studies carried out more than 20 years ago in this area.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Vegetation dynamics in side-channels reconnected to the Rhine River: what are the main factors controlling communities trajectories after restoration?
AN  - 1370211333
AB  - The hydraulic management of large rivers led to a disconnection of side-channels. Restoration works were to reconnect these side-channels to the main course in order to recover hydrological and ecological functions. The aim of the study was to analyze the vegetation dynamics after restoration and to link it to the change in chemical and hydro-geomorphological characteristics. Changes in species richness, cover and composition of the macrophytes communities were studied in nine side-channels of the Rhine river (France) after reconnection which occurred between 1998 and 2006. Vegetation dynamics was surveyed between 2007 and 2011 and compared to the ones of three target side-channels (never disconnected). Three vegetation communities were identified: one characterized by rheophilic species, a second one by mesotrophic species, and a third one by eutrophic species. Distribution of communities depended mainly on the flow velocity and the sediment texture of the side-channels. The floristic composition of communities evolved rapidly and remained stable a few years after restoration. Changes in species richness and cover remained relatively low in all side-channels over the study period. Time after restoration did not affect the dynamics of colonization. Reconnection allowed the restored side-channels to exhibit vegetation dynamics similar to those of the target side-channels.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Flow cytometry, microscopy, and DNA analysis as complementary phytoplankton screening methods in ballast water treatment studies
AN  - 1670315458
AB  - Ballast water is the main vector for marine invasions. To minimize the spread of invasive species, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has adopted the Ballast Water Management Convention which requires the installation of shipboard ballast water treatment systems (BWTS). During BWTS tests, the phytoplankton abundance and species composition were followed after treatment with both filtration and ultraviolet radiation. Although the installation fulfilled the IMO criteria after a 5-day holding time in a model ballast tank, the ultimate effectiveness of the treatment was further tested in long-term (20 days) incubation experiments under optimal phytoplankton growth conditions. Application of flow cytometry, microscopy, and DNA sequencing to these incubation samples gave an indication of the phytoplankton species that might be introduced by ballast water discharge--despite treatment. Phytoplankton was reliably quantified using flow cytometry, while fast identification was best done using microscopy. Some groups that contained potentially toxic species could not be identified at species level using microscopy; for these species, identification using genetic techniques was necessary. It is concluded that if long-term incubation experiments are used as an additional tool in testing BWTS effectiveness, a combination of phytoplankton screening methods can be applied depending on the detail of information that is required.

T1  - Impacts of ocean acidification on marine shelled molluscs
AN  - 1418351856
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Acidification

              
Over the next century, elevated quantities of atmospheric CO2 are expected to penetrate into the oceans, causing a reduction in pH (-0.3/-0.4 pH unit in the surface ocean) and in the concentration of carbonate ions (so-called ocean acidification). Of growing concern are the impacts that this will have on marine and estuarine organisms and ecosystems. Marine shelled molluscs, which colonized a large latitudinal gradient and can be found from intertidal to deep-sea habitats, are economically and ecologically important species providing essential ecosystem services including habitat structure for benthic organisms, water purification and a food source for other organisms. The effects of ocean acidification on the growth and shell production by juvenile and adult shelled molluscs are variable among species and even within the same species, precluding the drawing of a general picture. This is, however, not the case for pteropods, with all species tested so far, being negatively impacted by ocean acidification. The blood of shelled molluscs may exhibit lower pH with consequences for several physiological processes (e.g. respiration, excretion, etc.) and, in some cases, increased mortality in the long term. While fertilization may remain unaffected by elevated pCO2, embryonic and larval development will be highly sensitive with important reductions in size and decreased survival of larvae, increases in the number of abnormal larvae and an increase in the developmental time. There are big gaps in the current understanding of the biological consequences of an acidifying ocean on shelled molluscs. For instance, the natural variability of pH and the interactions of changes in the carbonate chemistry with changes in other environmental stressors such as increased temperature and changing salinity, the effects of species interactions, as well as the capacity of the organisms to acclimate and/or adapt to changing environmental conditions are poorly described.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Principles of Biofouling Protection in Marine Sponges: A Model for the Design of Novel Biomimetic and Bio-inspired Coatings in the Marine Environment?
AN  - 1372021763; 23525893
AB  - The process of biofouling of marine structures and substrates, such as platforms or ship hulls, proceeds in multiple steps. Soon after the formation of an initial conditioning film, formed via the adsorption of organic particles to natural or man-made substrates, a population of different bacterial taxa associates under the formation of a biofilm. These microorganisms communicate through a complex quorum sensing network. Macro-foulers, e.g., barnacles, then settle and form a fouling layer on the marine surfaces, a process that globally has severe impacts both on the economy and on the environment. Since the ban of tributyltin, an efficient replacement of this antifouling compound by next-generation antifouling coatings that are environmentally more acceptable and also showing longer half-lives has not yet been developed. The sponges, as sessile filter-feeder animals, have evolved antifouling strategies to protect themselves against micro- and subsequent macro-biofouling processes. Experimental data are summarized and suggest that coating of the sponge surface with bio-silica contributes to the inhibition of the formation of a conditioning film. A direct adsorption of the surfaces by microorganisms can be impaired through poisoning the organisms with direct-acting secondary metabolites or toxic peptides. In addition, first, compounds from sponges have been identified that interfere with the anti-quorum sensing network. Sponge secondary metabolites acting selectively on diatom colonization have not yet been identified. Finally, it is outlined that direct-acting secondary metabolites inhibiting the growth of macro-fouling animals and those that poison the multidrug resistance pump are available. It is concluded that rational screening programs for inhibitors of the complex and dynamic problem of biofilm production, based on multidisciplinary studies and using sponges as a model, are required in the future.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Spatially variable effects of a marine pest on ecosystem function
AN  - 1354391054; 23104271
AB  - The broad spectrum of anthropogenic pressures on many of the world's coastal bays and estuaries rarely act in isolation, yet few studies have directly addressed the interactive effects of multiple pressures. Port Phillip Bay in southeastern Australia is a semi-enclosed bay in which nutrient management is a major concern. In recent years it has been heavily invaded by marine pests. We manipulated the density of one such invader, the European fanworm Sabella spallanzanii, and showed that it causes changes in the composition of macrofauna in the surrounding sediments, provides habitat for epibiota (both fauna and flora) on Sabella tubes, and reduces the biomass of microphytobenthos on the surrounding sediments. Of greatest concern, however, was the indirect impact on nutrient cycling. We suggest that the impacts on nutrient cycling are largely due to the feeding of Sabella and the epifauna on its tubes, capturing organic N before it reaches the sediment, excreting it back up into the water column as NH^sub 4^, thereby bypassing sedimentary processes such as denitrification. Most notably, the efficiency of denitrification, the key ecosystem process that permanently removes N from the system, fell by 37-53 % in the presence of Sabella. Importantly though, this study also demonstrated significant spatial variability in fauna, geochemistry and the magnitude of Sabella effects. Given that the effect of Sabella is also likely to vary in time and with changes in density, all of these sources of variability need to be considered when incorporating the effects of Sabella in nutrient management strategies.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Biogeochemical transformation of a nutrient subsidy: salmon, streams, and nitrification
AN  - 1356661245
AB  - Issue Title: Special Section: Marine Ecosystem Connections:  essential indicators of healthy, productive and biologically diverse seas

              
Migratory animals can alter ecosystem function via the provision of nutrient subsidies. These subsidies are heterogeneous in space and time, which may create hot spots or hot moments in biogeochemical transformations, in turn altering the ecosystem effect of the subsidy by changing the form of the nutrients. Annual migrations of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) transport nutrients from the marine environment to their natal freshwater ecosystems. Salmon subsidies provide high quality nutrients (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus, carbon) that may also be large in quantity where salmon migrations are near historic levels. We hypothesized that the nutrient subsidy provided via the excretion of ammonium (NH^sub 4^ ^sup +^) by live salmon would stimulate microbially mediated nitrification rates in stream sediments and increase streamwater nitrate (NO3 ^sup â '^) concentrations. We quantified sediment nitrification in seven streams in Southeast Alaska before and during the salmon run in 2007 and 2008. Nitrification rates increased 3-fold from before to during the salmon run (meanÂ ±Â SEÂ =Â 0.07Â ±Â 0.01 to 0.24Â ±Â 0.02Â mgNÂ gAFDM^sup â '1^Â d^sup â '1^, respectively). The variation in nitrification was explained by both streamwater and exchangeable NH^sub 4^ ^sup +^ concentrations (R ^sup 2^Â =Â 0.50 and 0.71, respectively), which were low before salmon and increased relative to the size of the salmon run. To experimentally test the effect of salmon subsidies on nitrification rates, we staked senesced salmon carcasses on stream sediments for 3Â weeks during the salmon run and then measured nitrification rates directly under the carcasses. Sediment nitrification was 2â[euro]"5 times higher under the carcasses compared to nearby sediments without the direct carcass influence. Our results confirm that biogeochemical transformations alter the form of salmon-derived nitrogen, representing an overlooked aspect in the dynamics of this subsidy. Therefore, animal-derived nutrient subsidies are not passively retained or exported in recipient ecosystems, but also transformed, thereby influencing the form and incorporation of these nutrient subsidies.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Fitness Factors in Vibrios: a Mini-review
AN  - 1346496751; 23306394
AB  - Vibrios are Gram-negative curved bacilli that occur naturally in marine, estuarine, and freshwater systems. Some species include human and animal pathogens, and some vibrios are necessary for natural systems, including the carbon cycle and osmoregulation. Countless in vivo and in vitro studies have examined the interactions between vibrios and their environment, including molecules, cells, whole animals, and abiotic substrates. Many studies have characterized virulence factors, attachment factors, regulatory factors, and antimicrobial resistance factors, and most of these factors impact the organism's fitness regardless of its external environment. This review aims to identify common attributes among factors that increase fitness in various environments, regardless of whether the environment is an oyster, a rabbit, a flask of immortalized mammalian cells, or a planktonic chitin particle. This review aims to summarize findings published thus far to encapsulate some of the basic similarities among the many vibrio fitness factors and how they frame our understanding of vibrio ecology. Factors representing these similarities include hemolysins, capsular polysaccharides, flagella, proteases, attachment factors, type III secretion systems, chitin binding proteins, iron acquisition systems, and colonization factors.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Twenty-two Mya arenaria samples spanning seven marine ecoregions mostly situated in the Cold Temperate Northwest Atlantic (CTNA) biogeographic province were collected between 2001 and 2010 and genotyped at seven highly polymorphic microsatellite loci to test for population differentiation. Results showed strong regional differentiation with six genetic clusters: (1) Northern Gulf of St. Lawrence (GSL), (2) Magdalen Archipelago, (3) Southern GSL, (4) Lower Atlantic Canada, (5) US Coasts and (6) Northern Europe. Population structure was supported no matter the statistical approach and generally does not reflect the geographical limits of marine ecoregions. A latitudinal cline in allelic richness provides evidence for a northward post-glacial expansion range for this species. While geographical distance explains the genetic variation detected in southern CTNA, increased heterogeneity observed in northern CTNA can be explained by isolation by distance, marine landscaping and presumable selective processes acting at the Mar5 locus. Exclusion of Mar5 from analyses resulted in the detection of three genetic clusters instead of six.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Stability of lysosomal membrane in Carcinus maenas acts as a biomarker of exposure to pharmaceuticals
AN  - 1322479181; 23132752
AB  - The presence of pharmaceuticals in the environment is now a major concern given their potential adverse effects on organisms, particularly human beings. Because the feeding style and habitat of the crab Carcinus maenas make this species vulnerable to organic contaminants, it has been used previously in ecotoxicological studies. Lysosomal membrane stability (LMS) in crabs is a general indicator of cellular well-being and can be visualized by the neutral red retention (NRR) assay. LMS in crab hemolymph has been evaluated as a cellular biomarker of adverse effects produced by exposure to pharmaceutical compounds. Crabs were exposed in the laboratory to four different pharmaceuticals for 28 days in a semistatic 24-h renewal assay. Filtered seawater was spiked every 2 days with various concentrations (from 0.1 to 50 gL1) of caffeine, ibuprofen, carbamazepine, and novobiocin. Results showed that NRR time, measured at day 28, was significantly reduced (p<0.05) after exposure to environmental concentrations of each pharmaceutical (caffeine015 gL1; carbamazepine0 1 gL1; ibuprofen05 gL1; and novobiocin00.1 gL1) when compared with control organisms. The predicted no environmental effect concentration/ measured environmental concentration results showed that the selected pharmaceuticals are toxic at environmental concentrations and need further assessment. LMS monitoring in crabs is a sensitive tool for evaluating exposure to concentrations of selected drugs under laboratory conditions and provides a robust tier 1 testing approach (screening biomarker) for rapid assessment of marine pollution and environmental impact assessments for analyzing pharmaceutical contamination in aquatic environments.

T1  - Can the freshwater snail Bellamya aeruginosa (Mollusca) affect phytoplankton community and water quality?
AN  - 1317144467
AB  - The purpose of this microcosm experiment was to determine whether the freshwater snail Bellamya aeruginosa affected phytoplankton community and water quality. Three treatments of different snail densities (low, medium, and high) and a control (no snails) were set up in twelve enclosures. Chlorophyll a (chl a), transparency (SD), water temperature (WT), dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, nutrients, and abundance of phytoplankton were determined on days 0, 3, 7, 11, 15, 23, 31, 46, and 61. The total chl a concentration decreased and SD increased in the treatments, whereas the proportion of cyanobacteria chl a increased. Bellamya seemed to result indirectly in a decrease of DO, by reducing the algal biomass rather than by respiration. A significant decrease in nitrogenâ[euro]"phosphorus ratios was observed in the treatments. In the enclosed system the abundance of colonial green algae decreased over time whereas that of cyanobacteria and flagellates increased. Principal response curves showed that both phytoplankton community and water quality in the medium and high-density treatments were consistently different from in the control. These results indicate that the presence of snails resulted in a significant change of water physicochemical properties and phytoplankton community.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS AND TOXINS' IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT
AN  - 1622355041
AB  - The most common type of harmful algal blooms (HAB) is referred to as a "Red Tide" because the bloom discolors the water, making it appear red. However, HABs may also be yellow, orange, brown, green, white, or pink, depending on which one of the three primary types of phytoplankton are responsible for the problem; dinoflagellate, diatoms, or blue-green algae. Of the more than 4,400 marine phytoplankton species, only 50 to 60 are believed to be toxic. Many HABs, produce vividly colored blooms of cells that accumulate on surface water. This paper aims to increase the awareness of the scientific community as well as the general public of the aspects and effects of such a phenomenon, seeking the search for novel techniques and tools for limiting its influences on various water bodies. The harmful effect of the Red Tide phenomenon on the health of man, methods for its detection and means to overcome it will be intensely discussed.

T1  - In situ exposure history modulates the molecular responses to carbamate fungicide Tattoo in bivalve mollusk
AN  - 1317137292; 23306937
AB  - The aim of the present study was the investigation of the effect of in situ exposure history on the responses of freshwater mussels to thiocarbamate fungicide. Male bivalve mollusks Anodonta anatina (Unionidae) from polluted (A) and unpolluted (F) sites were subjected to 14Â days of exposure to fungicide Tattoo (mixture of propamocarb and mancozeb, 91Â [mu]gÂ L^sup â '1^). When unexposed mussels were compared, chronic effect of toxic environment in site A was confirmed by oxidative stress indices (high levels of superoxide dismutase and catalase activities, lipid peroxidation, protein carbonyls and oxyradical production, low level of total glutathione (GSH)), genotoxicity (high levels of DNA-strand breaks and caspase-3 activity in digestive gland), and cytotoxicity (low lysosomal membrane stability in hemocytes), elevated vitellogenin-like proteins (Vtg-LP) concentration in gonads, high levels of Cu, Zn, Cd, metallothionein (MT)-bound metals (MT-Me) and MT-related thiol (MT-SH), and low ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity in digestive gland. The major differences in the responses of the two exposed groups were related to antioxidant defense and MT: in the group A, prominent oxidative stress response with the participation of MT-SH and GSH in the gills, EROD activation, but decrease of MT-Me level was shown, whereas in group F exposure provoked the elevation of MT-Me, caspase-3 and Vtg-LP values. Carbamate did not cause cholinesterase depletion and cytotoxicity. However, genotoxic and pro-oxidant effects (increased levels of hemocytes with micronuclei and nuclear abnormalities, DNA-strand breaks and oxyradical in digestive gland), were common responses for both the exposed groups.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Life in an unstable house: community dynamics in changing mussel beds
AN  - 1314064931
AB  - Issue Title: Long-term research on marine ecosystems in the White Sea, Russia

              
Mussels are ecosystem engineers, and fluctuations in their abundance and population structure could be important to the associated community. There is, however, little understanding of this connection. In the present study, based on quantitative monitoring (1997-2011) of three mussel beds in a fjord-like White Sea bay, two hypotheses were tested: (1) mussel assemblages are temporally unstable and local population fluctuates cyclically as a result of negative adult-juvenile interactions; and (2) oscillations in mussel size-structure are correlated with changes in the associated community structure. A negative correlation found between the abundance of small (length < 21 mm) and large (length > 20 mm) mussels suggests that adult mussels indeed suppress recruitment. Such interaction implies an auto-oscillatory pattern of population dynamics, with Large- and Small-dominated stages temporally replacing each other. This cyclic pattern was clearly revealed for one mussel bed only, but long-term replacement of the Large-dominated stage by the Small-dominated stage was revealed for the other two assemblages also. In general, temporal variations of mussel populations were significantly correlated with the dynamics of the associated community, although several abundant taxa (Tubificoides benedii, Littorina saxatilis, Macoma balthica, and Gammaridae) were insensitive to mussel changes. In contrast, filamentous algae and mud snails Hydrobia ulvae tended to be more abundant during the Large-dominated stage, whereas polychaetes Dipolydora quadrilobata were most abundant during the Small-dominated stage. Several other abundant "sensitive" taxa were obviously dependent on algal bloom. Thus, mussel beds are unstable systems, whose dynamics are shaped not only by the ecosystem engineer but also by the associated community.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - STATUS OF THE OFFSHORE DEMERSAL FISH COMMUNITY
AN  - 1431403228
AB  - The native deepwater demersal-prey-fish community in Lake Huron was dominated historically by deepwater ciscoes, sculpins, and cisco, with ninespine sticklebacks and trout-perch also present. By the 1950s, the native community was disrupted by introductions of alewife and rainbow smelt and came to be dominated by these invasive species. The US Geological Survey (USGS), in cooperation with the US Fish and Wildlife Service and the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, also has produced pelagic-fish abundance estimates derived from acoustic surveys in most years since 2004, but, due to the short time series and missing data, these estimates are less useful in assessing long-term trends in abundance but are included here for comparisons with the trawl estimates. The estimated abundance of young-of-the-year alewife, rainbow smelt, and bloater has spiked erratically since 2003 in the USGS bottom-trawl time series.

T1  - STATUS OF NEARSHORE FISH COMMUNITIES
AN  - 1431403200
AB  - A recent review found that 96 of the 104 species native to Lake Huron were still extant, while 21 species have been introduced from elsewhere in the Great Lakes, the Mississippi River drainage, or from outside eastern North America. People know of no new additions or extirpations to the fish fauna of Lake Huron during this reporting period, 2005-2010. Prospects for maintaining native biodiversity in Lake Huron have improved during this reporting period. First, the alewife population has not rebounded after its collapse during 2002-2004. Monitoring of nearshore fish communities at selected locations in Ontario waters of the main basin, Georgian Bay, and the North Channel recorded over 60 species, indicating a considerable diversity of fishes. Species thought to be absent from the lake, such as banded killifish were captured in substantial numbers at several locations.

T1  - Comparisons of zooplankton and phytoplankton in created shallow water habitats of the lower Missouri River: implications for native fish
AN  - 1323545656
AB  - Shallow water habitat (SWH) is important for riverine fish and their invertebrate prey, yet the availability of SWH has declined in many systems due to human impacts. We evaluated the potential ecological benefits of restoring SWH by comparing zooplankton and phytoplankton from created backwaters (a floodplain feature connected to the river on the downstream end but disconnected at the upstream end) and chutes (a side channel of the river that diverts flow from the main channel through the chute and back into the main channel) on the lower Missouri River. We tested the hypothesis that backwaters support higher abundances of zooplankton and phytoplankton than chutes using data that were collected during the summer of 2010. As predicted, backwaters had more diverse cladoceran communities and greater abundances of rotifers, copepod nauplii, adult copepods, and cladocerans than chutes. Total algal biovolume was the same in chutes and backwaters; however, phytoplankton taxa richness was higher in backwaters, and there was a greater biovolume of green algae (Chlorophyta), Crypotophyta, cyanobacteria, and Euglenophyta in backwaters than in chutes. Differences in zooplankton and phytoplankton between backwaters and chutes appeared to be related to slower current velocities, longer retention times, and lower levels of turbidity and total suspended solids in backwaters. While chutes have the potential to provide greater habitat diversity than the mainstem, there were no differences in water quality or phytoplankton abundance, community structure, or diversity between these two habitats. Combined, our results suggest that created backwaters initially provide a greater potential food resource for native fishes. However, additional research is needed to determine whether chutes can also develop beneficial shallow water features over a longer period of time.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Genetic diversity and population differentiation in the cockle Cerastoderma edule estimated by microsatellite markers
AN  - 1303427577
AB  - The edible cockle Cerastoderma edule is a marine bivalve commercially fished in several European countries that have lately suffered a significant decrease in production. Despite its commercial importance, genetic studies in this species are scarce. In this work, genetic diversity and population differentiation of C. edule has been assessed using 11 microsatellite markers in eight locations from the European Atlantic coast. All localities showed similar observed and expected heterozygosity values, but displayed differences in allelic richness, with lowest values obtained for localities situated farther north. Global Fst value revealed the existence of significant genetic structure; all but one locality from the Iberian Peninsula were genetically homogeneous, while more remote localities from France, The Netherlands, and Scotland were significantly different from all other localities. A combined effect of isolation by distance and the existence of barriers that limit gene flow may explain the differentiation observed.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Size-selective predation of the catfish Pimelodus pintado (Siluriformes: Pimelodidae) on the golden mussel Limnoperna fortunei (Bivalvia: Mytilidae)
AN  - 1323569578
AB  - This paper describes the size-selective predation on Limnoperna fortunei (Dunker, 1857) by Pimelodus pintado (Azpelicueta, Lundberg & Loureiro, 2008) from the time it arrived at the Mirim Lagoon basin (2005). Sampling was carried out using bottom trawl in depths of 3-6 m, from January to November 2005, and from October to November 2008. Pimelodus pintado began to prey upon L. fortunei soon after its arrival (austral spring of 2005). On the spring of 2008, L. fortunei was found to be the most important food item of P. pintado. The variation in length of the mussels (0.7-3.2 cm, with a mode of 1.3 cm) indicates that the species is now fully established in the system. Our data indicates that large individuals of P. pintado incorporate more mussels in their diets than small individuals. However, regardless of their size, P. pintado individuals predate only on small (<1.4 cm) representatives of L. fortunei. This prey size corresponds to a phase when the mussel is more mobile and readily available for fish. Larger, more aggregated prey groups that are attached to hard substrates are avoided by fish predators.  [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Genetic structure of wild European populations of the invasive Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas due to aquaculture practices
AN  - 1270350190
AB  - As a result of aquaculture activities, Pacific oysters Crassostrea gigas (Thunberg, 1793) have invaded European coasts. Using seven microsatellites, we found virtually no genetic differentiation between natural populations throughout the European range (from the south of the Wadden Sea (the Netherlands) to the south of France) and French cultivated oysters. The genetic homogeneity of Pacific oyster samples appears to be the result of repeated transfers from same seed stocks made for aquaculture and, to a lesser extent, widespread dispersal due to specific biological traits of this species. The only genetic differentiation of Sylt population in the north of the Wadden Sea (Germany) suggests a stronger, persistent impact of ongoing supply of new genetic material from hatchery production, corresponding to seeds selection made by breeders. All of our genetic data highlighted the importance of aquaculture practices on the genetic structure of the keystone invader C. gigas in Europe.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Variation in oxygen consumption among 'living fossils' (Mollusca: Polyplacophora)
AN  - 1239755211
AB  - Polyplacophoran molluscs (chitons) are phylogenetically ancient and morphologically constrained, yet multiple living species are often found co-occurring within widely overlapping ecological niches. This study used two sets of experiments to compare interspecific variation among co-occurring species in the North Atlantic (Ireland) and separately in the North Pacific (British Columbia, Canada) chiton faunas. A complementary review of historical literature on polyplacophoran physiology provides an overview of the high level of metabolic variability in this group of 'living fossils'. Species examined in de novo experiments showed significant variation in oxygen consumption both under air-saturated water conditions (normoxia), and in response to decreasing oxygen availability (hypoxia). Some species demonstrate an ability to maintain constant oxygen uptake rates despite hypoxia (oxyregulators), while others oxyconform, with uptake rate dependent on ambient oxygen tension. These organisms are often amalgamated in studies of benthic communities, yet show obvious physiological difference that may impact their response or tolerance to environmental change.

T1  - Comparing community structure on shells of the abalone Haliotis midae and adjacent rock: implications for biodiversity
AN  - 1411846985
AB  - This paper concerns the effects on biodiversity of depletion of the South African abalone Haliotis midae, which is a long-lived species with a large corrugated shell that provides a habitat for diverse benthic organisms. We compared community structure on H. midae shells with that on adjacent rock at three sites (Cape Point and Danger Point sites A and B) and at two different times of the year at one of these sites. Shells of H. midae consistently supported communities that were distinctly different from those on rock. In particular, three species of non-geniculate (encrusting) corallines, Titanoderma polycephalum, Mesophyllum engelhartii and Spongites discoideus, were all found either exclusively or predominantly on shells, whereas another non-geniculate coralline, Heydrichia woelkerlingii, occurred almost exclusively on adjacent rock. The primary rocky substratum, however, supported a higher number of species than abalone shells. Possible reasons for the differences between the two substrata include the relative age, microtopography and hardness of the substrata; the abundance of grazers on them; and the relative age of different zones of the abalone shell, which support communities at different stages of succession. Diversity on shells was lowest in zones that were either very young or very old, in keeping with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. The distinctiveness of shell epibiota will increase [beta] diversity despite having a lower [alpha] diversity than that of adjacent rock. Decimation of H. midae by overfishing therefore has implications for biodiversity conservation.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - The nesting success of Coots (Fulica atra) breeding at lakes and small inland water bodies in the Mazurian Lakeland, Poland, was estimated in 2008 and 2009. Mean nesting success, indicated by hatching, was 75%; it was highest at lakes in the vicinity of built-up areas (86%), moderate at small inland water bodies (69%) and lowest at lakes far from human settlements (44%). Nesting success improved with decreasing distance to open water. Our results suggest that small inland water bodies and built-up areas along lake banks may serve as Coot refuges, acting as safeguards against predation, especially by the American Mink.

T1  - Acute and Behavioral Sensitivity of Mesocyclops longisetus to Atrazine and Endosulfan Formulations under Predation Pressure
AN  - 1268870966
AB  - The present study analyzes the acute and behavioral toxicity of two commercial formulations of endosulfan and atrazine (Gesaprim 90 WDG and Zebra Ciagro, respectively) on the cyclopoid copepod Mesocyclops longisetus. The studied behavior was the "escape ability" because of its ecological importance in natural predator-prey interactions. This was investigated using two experimental designs: (1) a simulated predator (applying a hydraulic device) and (2) a real one (the zooplanktophagous fish Cnesterodon decemmaculatus). Both pesticides resulted highly toxic to adults and nauplii at even relatively low concentrations and similar to those found in field studies. Copepods' survival was not only directly affected but also indirectly through altering their escape behavior, which may have increased their vulnerability to predation. The escape ability, measured with the simulated predator was stimulated early (up to 6 h of exposition) but inhibited later (after 24 h of exposition). The predation experiments with the real predator were in accordance with these results. The comparison of both experimental designs corroborates the effectiveness of the hydraulic mechanism as a testing method.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Generic ecological impact assessments of alien species in Norway: a semi-quantitative set of criteria
AN  - 1266636603
AB  - The ecological impact assessment scheme that has been developed to classify alien species in Norway is presented. The underlying set of criteria enables a generic and semi-quantitative impact assessment of alien species. The criteria produce a classification of alien species that is testable, transparent and easily adjustable to novel evidence or environmental change. This gives a high scientific and political legitimacy to the end product and enables an effective prioritization of management efforts, while at the same time paying attention to the precautionary principle. The criteria chosen are applicable to all species regardless of taxonomic position. This makes the assessment scheme comparable to the Red List criteria used to classify threatened species. The impact of alien species is expressed along two independent axes, one measuring invasion potential, the other ecological effects. Using this two-dimensional approach, the categorization captures the ecological impact of alien species, which is the product rather than the sum of spread and effect. Invasion potential is assessed using three criteria, including expected population lifetime and expansion rate. Ecological effects are evaluated using six criteria, including interactions with native species, changes in landscape types, and the potential to transmit genes or parasites. Effects on threatened species or landscape types receive greater weightings.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Assessing Nitrogen Dynamics Throughout the Estuarine Landscape
AN  - 1266624207
AB  - Assessing nitrogen dynamics in the estuarine landscape is challenging given the unique effects of individual habitats on nitrogen dynamics. We measured net N2 fluxes, sediment oxygen demand, and fluxes of ammonium and nitrate seasonally from five major estuarine habitats: salt marshes, seagrass beds (SAV), oyster reefs, and intertidal and subtidal flats. Net N2 fluxes ranged from 332±116 μmolN-N2m^sup -2^h^sup -1^ from oyster reef sediments in the summer to -67±4 μmolN-N2m^sup -2^h^sup -1^ from SAV in the winter. Oyster reef sediments had the highest rate of N2 production of all habitats. Dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) was measured during the summer and winter. DNRA was low during the winter and ranged from 4.5±3.0 in subtidal flats to 104±34 μmol^sup 15^NH^sub 4^^sup +^m^sup -2^h^sup -1^ in oyster reefs during the summer. Annual denitrification, accounting for seasonal differences in inundation and light, ranged from 161.1±19.2 mmolN-N2m^sup -2^year^sup -1^ for marsh sediments to 509.9±122.7 mmolN-N2m^sup -2^year^sup -1^ for SAV sediments. Given the current habitat distribution in our study system, an estimated 28.3×10^sup 6^mol of N are removed per year or 76 % of estimated watershed nitrogen load. These results indicate that changes in the area and distribution of habitats in the estuarine landscape will impact ecosystem function and services.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Contamination by metals and pharmaceuticals in northern Taihu Lake (China) and its relation to integrated biomarker response in fish
AN  - 1266619092; 23053787
AB  - Taihu Lake is the largest shallow freshwater lake in eastern China and is suffering not only from an increasingly serious threat of eutrophication but also potential ecological risk due to the input of emerging contaminants. Active biomonitoring was conducted in Taihu Lake using transplanted goldfish (Carassius auratus) to determine the contamination by pharmaceuticals and metals and to assess the potential ecological risk. A suite of biomarkers including acetylcholinesterase, ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase, glutathione S-transferase, glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase activities in fish after 7, 14, 21 and 28 days of exposure in situ, as well as pharmaceuticals and metals in water, were determined during the field exposure period. The results indicate that pharmaceuticals exist mainly in Zhushan Bay and Meiliang Bay, while metals are present mainly in Gong Bay. An integrated biomarker response (IBR) was calculated and used to evaluate the ecological risk of the polluted area of Taihu Lake. It was found that Zhushan Bay might present higher risk to fish, followed by Meiliang Bay. IBR values were in good agreement with copper and caffeine concentrations.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Effects of salinity on the immune response of an 'osmotic generalist' bird
AN  - 1266574726; 22782496
AB  - Salt stress can suppress the immune function of fish and other aquatic animals, but such an effect has not yet been examined in air-breathing vertebrates that frequently cope with waters (and prey) of contrasting salinities. We investigated the effects of seawater salinity on the strength and cost of mounting an immune response in the dunlin Calidris alpina, a long-distance migratory shorebird that shifts seasonally from freshwater environments during the breeding season to marine environments during migration and the winter period. Phytohaemagglutinin (PHA)-induced skin swelling, basal metabolic rate (BMR), body mass, fat stores, and plasma ions were measured in dunlins acclimated to either freshwater or seawater (salinity: 0.3 and 35.0 [per thousand], respectively). Seawater-acclimated dunlins mounted a PHA-induced swelling response that was up to 56 % weaker than those held under freshwater conditions, despite ad libitum access to food. Freshwater-acclimated dunlins significantly increased their relative BMR 48 h after PHA injection, whereas seawater-acclimated dunlins did not. However, this differential immune and metabolic response between freshwater- and seawater-acclimated dunlins was not associated with significant changes in body mass, fat stores or plasma ions. Our results indicate that the strength of the immune response of this small-sized migratory shorebird was negatively influenced by the salinity of marine habitats. Further, these findings suggest that the reduced immune response observed under saline conditions might not be caused by an energy or nutrient limitation, and raise questions about the role of osmoregulatory hormones in the modulation of the immune system.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Managing wetlands as off-river storages: impacts on zooplankton communities
AN  - 1266473235
AB  - The competing demands of the environment and agriculture has challenged managers of waterways and prompted the development of new and novel ways of providing water for consumptive use without compromising the aquatic ecosystem. One partial remedy that has been proposed involves using wetlands as intermediary off-river storages to achieve consumptive benefits whilst maintaining ecological values. This study assessed the suitability of such a strategy by examining the impact of artificial drawdown on wetland zooplankton communities. An experiment was undertaken in outdoor mesocosms in which two treatments were compared over a 109-day duration: (1) partial artificial drawdown--where approximately half of the water was siphoned out after 42 days; and (2) natural drawdown--where the water was left to drawdown naturally via evaporation. Artificial drawdown only caused a small acceleration (<4 weeks) in the decline of abundance and density associated with natural population fluctuations, and temporarily changed the community structure. Furthermore, it had no effect on taxon richness, community composition and the initiation of dormancy. This suggests that wetlands could potentially be used for supporting consumptive demands whilst still maintaining abundant and diverse zooplankton communities, and hence a suitable food supply for higher order consumers such as fish and waterfowl.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AN  - 1312307674
AB  - Fishery managers are utilizing appropriate tools to manage the offshore fish community for the greatest public good given the variability in the ecosystem. The approach of maintaining Pacific salmonine (e.g., Chinook and coho salmon, steelhead) populations at levels that provide recreational opportunities and that control non-indigenous forage fishes, while making a major commitment to rehabilitate native species, is a challenging but appropriate management approach given the biological and institutional realities, social concerns, and priorities. Given this challenge, we recommend the following priority research actions to increase the likelihood of achieving the FCOs in the coming years: 1. reassess the Level II triggers in the red-flag analysis and fuse this analysis with DA to provide for more strategic management actions, 2. ensure interagency lake trout sampling is sufficient to allow measurement of the benchmarks identified in the new implementation strategy, and 3. promote rehabilitation of native prey fishes, such as bloater and cisco.

T1  - Windows of change: temporal scale of analysis is decisive to detect ecosystem responses to climate change
AN  - 1125249814
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: AQUASHIFT: The Impact of Climate Variability on Aquatic Ecosystems

              
Long-term ecological research has become a cornerstone of the scientific endeavour to better understand ecosystem responses to environmental change. This paper provides a perspective on how such research could be advanced. It emphasizes that a profound understanding of the mechanisms underlying these responses requires that records of ecologic processes be not only sufficiently long, but also collected at an appropriate temporal resolution. We base our argument on an overview of studies of climate impacts in limnic and marine ecosystems, suggesting that lakes and oceans respond to (short-term) weather conditions during critical time windows in the year. The observed response patterns are often time-lagged or driven by the crossing of thresholds in weather-related variables (such as water temperature and thermal stratification intensity). It becomes clear from the previous studies that average annual, seasonal or monthly climate data often fall short of characterizing the thermal dynamics that most organisms respond to. To illustrate such literature-based evidence using a concrete example, we compare 2 years of water temperature data from Müggelsee (Berlin, Germany) at multiple temporal scales (from hours to years). This comparison underlines the pitfalls of analysing data at resolutions not high enough to detect critical differences in environmental forcing. Current science initiatives that aim at improving the temporal resolution of long-term observatory data in aquatic systems will help to identify adequate timescales of analysis necessary for the understanding of ecosystem responses to climate change.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Temporal patterns of populations in a warming world: a modelling framework
AN  - 1125242493
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: AQUASHIFT: The Impact of Climate Variability on Aquatic Ecosystems

              
In this paper, we present an approach for describing the environmentally induced temporal pattern of structured populations by partial integro-differential equations. Populations are structured according to size or stage. Growth, energy allocation and stage transitions are affected by environmental conditions of which temperature, photoperiod, water depth and food supply were taken into account. The resulting modelling framework was applied to describe, analyse and predict alterations in populations with continuous development, populations with distinct state structures and interacting populations. Our exemplary applications consider populations of freshwater Amphipoda, Isopoda and Odonata. The model was capable of simulating life cycle alterations in dependence on temperature in interaction with other environmental factors: (1) population dynamics, (2) seasonal regulation, (3) water depth-dependent dispersal, (4) intraguild predation and (5) consumer-resource dynamics.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Exclosure study on the exploitation of macrophytes by summering and moulting waterbirds at Lower Lake Constance
AN  - 1037269339
AB  - Issue Title: Limnology and Aquatic Birds: Monitoring, Modelling and Management

              
Owing to synchronous moult, most waterbird species are constrained by flightlessness and limited mobility for several weeks. As new feather production is energy demanding, these birds need to choose a safe moulting site with appropriate food supply. Up to 20,000 waterbirds carry out moult at Lake Constance, gathering at sites where they find food close to safe hiding places from predators and human-caused disturbance. In this study, we focused on the food supply at one prominent moulting site, Mettnau Südbucht, at Lower Lake Constance. We aimed to determine the food items and quantity as well as their utilization by summering and moulting waterbirds. We conducted experiments with exclosure cages which protected macrophytes from bird grazing and compared these sites with unprotected grazed sites. In these experiments, we found that the summering and moulting waterbird community, dominated by Eurasian Coots (Fulica atra Linnaeus), caused a significant decline of the macrophyte biomass at 1.5-m depth (MWL), where they were responsible for a loss of over 40% of the total charophyte biomass. No grazing effect was found at a greater depth (2-m MWL). The available food consisted mostly of Chara spp. with a biomass density of about 350 g m^sup -2^. Animal food items were negligible: Macroinvertebrates, mainly Asellus aquaticus Linnaeus, that were associated with the macrophytes, made up only 2% of total biomass, and were very unevenly distributed.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Influence of a Marine Diatom on the Embryonic Toxicity of 17[alpha]-Ethynylestradiol to the Abalone Haliotis diversicolor supertexta
AN  - 1030337563
AB  - The embryos of a marine abalone, Haliotis diversicolor supertexta, were exposed to a typical environmental estrogen, 17α-ethynylestradiol (EE2), for 96 h, to examine the acute toxicity of EE2 to the embryogenesis of the abalone. A marine diatom, Navicula incerta, was used in the test media as settlement substrate and food for the abalone larvae. During the embryo culture, more than 30 % of EE2 could be removed from the test media by the diatom, mainly via biodegradation, leading to a decrease of water-borne exposure dose. Further, the exposure concentrations of EE2 around the living microenvironment of the abalone larvae could be magnified 350-468 times after the larvae settled on the diatom, as indicated by the bioconcentration factors of EE2 in the diatom. Increased bioaccumulation of EE2 in the diatom caused greater inhibition on the metamorphosis of the abalone larvae by enhancing the uptake of EE2 in the larvae via dietary exposure, while declined water-borne exposure dose did not affect the embryonic toxicity of EE2 and its uptake in the abalone larvae. The 96-h median effective concentration of EE2 to the metamorphosis of the abalone larvae was 10.01 μg L^sup -1^, when the exposure doses in both the test media and the diatom were controlled stable. The 96-h hazard concentration for 5 % of the species was 1.20 μg L^sup -1^, which was still higher than but close to the reported upper contamination level of EE2 and could be employed as the safety threshold for the metamorphosis of the abalone embryos.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Waterbird-mediated passive dispersal of river shrimp Athyaephyra desmaresti
AN  - 1024199395
AB  - The river shrimp Athyaephyra desmaresti is a Mediterranean species which in recent years expanded its distribution, colonizing rivers of central Europe. The purpose of this study was to investigate the possibility of passive external dispersal of the river shrimp Athyaephyra desmaresti by waterfowl. We performed experiments testing shrimp desiccation survival, probability of attachment to waterfowl, and probability of successful transport. We found that in the laboratory 10% of the river shrimps can survive out of water for up to 90.1 min, but this period was reduced to 18.5 min under simulated bird flight conditions. Two different outdoor experiments simulating bird flight conditions indicated a 50% probability of successful transport on flight distances over 15 km. Our results using dead ducks show evidence that small, large or ovigerous river shrimps can attach to and be transported by ducks and that this capacity is affected by water depth. This study demonstrated that waterbird-mediated passive dispersal of river shrimps can occur and may be important for genetic flows between populations and for the colonization of new sites.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Sperm polymorphism and genetic divergence in the mussel Perumytilus purpuratus
AN  - 1027261196
AB  - For the first time in a marine bivalve species, geographic intraspecific variation in sperm morphology in the Chilean mussel, Perumytilus purpuratus, is reported. Samples were obtained in December 2010 from the rocky intertidal at three locations: Antofagasta (23º44'01.08''S, 70º26'26.11''W), Valparaíso (32º57'23.07''S, 71º33'01.86''W), and Valdivia (39°50'44.26''S, 73°25'51.99''W). Scanning electron microscopy was used to describe sperm traits, and genetic data were obtained by sequencing a 16S mtDNA 427-bp fragment. The results showed geographic intraspecific variation with two statistically significant patterns of genetically differentiated sperm morphologies. One genetic clade was found for Antofagasta and Valparaíso, displaying a unique sperm morphotype with a short acrosome accounting for 26 % of the head length, and the other from Valdivia, with a larger acrosome occupying 47 % of the head length. These results will lead to new research to distinguish among alternative hypotheses: the presence of cryptic species, incipient speciation, or a polymorphism in sperm traits of P. purpuratus.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Environmental conditions in a lagoon and their possible effects on shellfish contamination by Giardia and Cryptosporidium
AN  - 1024415731
AB  - Over a 1-year period, we carried out an analysis for the presence of Giardia and Cryptosporidium (oo)cysts in 934 specimens taken from four species of shellfish farmed in the Varano Lagoon. We also studied the chemical, physical and meteo-climatic parameters in the same environment, to evaluate the possible effects of environmental conditions on protozoan contamination in farmed shellfish. Using both IF and molecular tests, all 38 pools of shellfish gave negative values for Giardia and Cryptosporidium oo/cysts, thus confirming previous investigations. The environmental factors considered having a negative influence on the survival of Giardia and Cryptosporidium are high water temperatures (8-29°C) and high salinity levels (23-32 ppt). However, the small amount of freshwater discharged into the lagoon (up to 0.0091 m^sup 3^ s^sup -1^), the long-lasting solar irradiation (mean of 896 W m^sup -2^) and the shallowness of the lagoon (mean 2.5 m) may also have a synergic effect in limiting the presence of Giardia and Cryptosporidium in the lagoon.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Are the toxic sediments deposited at Flix reservoir affecting the Ebro river biota? Purple heron eggs and nestlings as indicators
AN  - 1021031459; 22526922
AB  - The Flix reservoir, in the low course of the Ebro River, contains thousands of tons of polluted sediments, accumulated from the activities of a chemical factory. An ongoing project is working toward removing these pollutants. Piscivore birds like the purple heron (Ardea purpurea) may be useful bioindicators, so eggs and nestling feathers were sampled during the 2006-2008 breeding seasons at three localities: a reference site situated upstream and two potentially affected by the toxic muds; one at the focal area and one at a distal area, the Ebro Delta. The samples were analyzed for isotopic signatures of ^sup 15^N and ^sup 13^C and concentrations of heavy metals and selenium. Baseline nitrogen signatures were higher in riverine sites than in the delta. Nitrogen together with carbon signatures adequately discriminated riverine and deltaic ecosystems. Mercury levels are highly influenced by the polluted sediments at Flix and pose potential risks for the birds, as they are among the highest ever recorded in heron species. Selenium and copper concentrations probably derive from other sources. Except for mercury, heavy metals and selenium levels were below toxic levels. Purple heron eggs and nestling feathers have demonstrated their usefulness as bioindicators for pollution in the river biota; feathers in particular show pollutant impacts on a strict local basis. A long series of study years is necessary in dynamic ecosystems such as this, so continued monitoring of the heron population at Flix is advisable to trace the effects of the toxic muds, particularly during their removal, because of the high levels of mercury detected.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Indicators of environmental stress: cellular biomarkers and reproductive responses in the Sydney rock oyster (Saccostrea glomerata)
AN  - 1021031447; 22526923
AB  - We measured a suite of common biomarker responses for the first time in the Sydney rock oyster Saccostrea glomerata to evaluate their utility as biological effects measures for pollution monitoring. To examine the relationship between biomarker responses and population level effects, fertilisation and embryo development assays were also conducted. Adult oysters were deployed in two contaminated estuaries and a reference estuary in Sydney, Australia. The concentrations of various contaminants (metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, PAHs) were quantified in oyster's tissue from each site and both metals and total PAHs were significantly elevated in contaminated estuaries relative to the reference estuary. Lysosomal membrane destabilisation, lipid peroxidation levels and glutathione (GSH) concentrations were measured in the digestive gland of oysters. Of all biomarkers measured, lysosomal membrane destabilisation proved to be the most useful indicator of oysters facing anthropogenic stress and we suggest this may be an especially useful biomarker for incorporation into local environmental monitoring programs. Moreover, lysosomal membrane destabilisation showed good correlations with fertilisation, normal embryo development and estuary status. GSH and lipid peroxidation were not as valuable for distinguishing between estuaries exposed to differing levels of anthropogenic stress, but did provide additional valuable information regarding overall health status of the oysters.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Hot and salty: the temperature and salinity preferences of a temperate estuarine shrimp larva, Upogebia pusilla (Decapoda: Thalassinidea)
AN  - 1016441419
AB  - At a time when global climate changes are forcing life to adapt to a warming and salinity-changing environment, it is essential to understand how future changes in ocean chemistry will affect species. This study evaluates the combined effects of temperature and salinity on survival and development of Upogebia pusilla larvae. Combinations were made from three temperatures (18, 23, and 28°C) and three salinities (15, 25, and 35). Survival, larval duration and megalopa size were compared between treatments. U. pusilla larvae developed optimally in the highest salinity (35) and higher temperatures (23-28°C). Low salinities and temperatures did not support larval survival and development, with salinity being the main restricting factor for survival, while temperature affected mainly the duration of the larval stages. Larvae at higher temperatures (23-28°C) presented a higher development rate but no differences were found in megalopa size.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - First report on the importance of alien gobiids in the diet of native piscivorous fishes in the lower Vistula River (Poland)
AN  - 1366365732
AB  - We conducted a snapshot study to check the importance of non-native Ponto-Caspian gobies (monkey and racer goby) in the diet of native obligate (northern pike, pikeperch) and facultative (Eurasian perch) predators in the Vistula River 3-4 years after the appearance of aliens. In total 71 fish with non-empty stomachs, taken randomly from net catches from various parts of the river were analyzed, including 32 pike, 20 pikeperch and 19 perch specimens. We found that gobiids prevailed in the diet of smaller (<30 cm standard length, SL) individuals of pike and pikeperch, as well as larger (>15 cm SL) specimens of perch, although the effect of predator size on the presence of gobiids in the diet was not significant in the case of perch. Our results indicate that gobiids as a prey fish can stimulate considerable changes in local food webs, which require further studies.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Trophic ecology of reef sharks determined using stable isotopes and telemetry
AN  - 1013445600
AB  - Establishing the ecological role of predators within an ecosystem is central to understanding community dynamics and is useful in designing effective management and conservation strategies. We analysed differences in the trophic ecology of four species of reef sharks (Carcharhinus melanopterus, Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos, Triaenodon obesus and Negaprion acutidens) at Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia, by analysing tissue stable isotopes (δ^sup 15^N and δ^sup 13^C). We also monitored animals using acoustic telemetry to determine long-term residency patterns in a bay at the southern end of the reef, Coral Bay. Overall, mean δ^sup 13^C was similar among species, ranging between -10.9 and -11.8[per thousand], suggesting a food-web dependency on coastal producers. Classification and regression tree analysis identified an effect of species on δ^sup 15^N that separated C. amblyrhynchos and C. melanopterus from N. acutidens and T. obesus. For C. amblyrhynchos and C. melanopterus, animals were also divided by size classes, with smaller sharks having lower average δ^sup 15^N than larger animals; this suggests that δ^sup 15^N increases with size for these two species. Juvenile C. melanopterus, juvenile N. acutidens and adult T. obesus had trophic levels of 3.7, for juvenile C. amblyrhynchos and adult C. melanopterus it was 4, and adult C. amblyrhynchos had a value of 4.3. Trophic-level estimates for C. melanopterus and C. amblyrhynchos corroborate previous conclusions based on diet studies. We found no evidence for a difference in isotopic composition between resident and non-resident sharks. The lack of variation in isotopic composition was consistent with high mean residency of these species recorded using acoustic telemetry, which was 79% (±0.09 SE) of days monitored for T. obesus, followed by N. acutidens (57 ± 19.55%), C. amblyrhynchos (54 ± 13%) and C. melanopterus (33 ± 8.28%). High δ^sup 13^C composition in reef sharks and long-term residency behaviour suggest that coastal marine reserves might provide effective conservation refuges for some species.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Shell morphology and relative growth variability of the invasive pearl oyster Pinctada radiata in coastal Tunisia
AN  - 962213618
AB  - The variability of shell morphology and relative growth of the invasive pearl oyster Pinctada radiata was studied within and among ten populations from coastal Tunisia using discriminant tests. Therefore, 12 morphological characters were examined and 34 metric and weight ratios were defined. In addition to the classic morphological characters, populations were compared by the thickness of the nacreous layer. Results of Duncan's multiple comparison test showed that the most discriminative ratios were the width of nacreous layer of right valve to the inflation of shell, the hinge line length to the maximum width of shell and the nacre thickness to the maximum width of shell. The analysis of variance revealed an important inter-population morphological variability. Both multidimensional scaling analysis and the squared Mahalanobis distances (D
2) of metric ratios divided Tunisian P. radiata populations into four biogeographical groupings: the north coast (La Marsa); harbours (Hammamet, Monastir and Zarzis); the Gulf of Gabès (Sfax, Kerkennah Island, Maharès, Skhira and Djerba) and the intertidal area (Ajim). However, the Kerkennah Island population was discriminated by the squared Mahalanobis distances (D
2) of weight ratios in an isolated group suggesting particular trophic conditions in this area. The allometric study revealed high linear correlation between shell morphological characters and differences in allometric growth among P. radiata populations. Unlike the morphological discrimination, allometric differentiation shows no clear geographical distinction. This study revealed that the pearl oyster P. radiata exhibited considerable phenotypic plasticity related to differences of environmental and/or ecological conditions along Tunisian coasts and highlighted the discriminative character of the nacreous layer thickness parameter.

T1  - Mercury in the pelagic food web of Lake Champlain
AN  - 929917432; 22193540
AB  - Lake Champlain continues to experience mercury contamination resulting in public advisories to limit human consumption of top trophic level fish such as walleye. Prior research suggested that mercury levels in biota could be modified by differences in ecosystem productivity as well as mercury loadings. We investigated relationships between mercury in different trophic levels in Lake Champlain. We measured inorganic and methyl mercury in water, seston, and two size fractions of zooplankton from 13 sites representing a range of nutrient loading conditions and productivity. Biomass varied significantly across lake segments in all measured ecosystem compartments in response to significant differences in nutrient levels. Local environmental factors such as alkalinity influenced the partitioning of mercury between water and seston. Mercury incorporation into biota was influenced by the biomass and mercury content of different ecosystem strata. Pelagic fish tissue mercury was a function of fish length and the size of the mercury pool associated with large zooplankton. We used these observations to parameterize a model of mercury transfers in the Lake Champlain food web that accounts for ecosystem productivity effects. Simulations using the mercury trophic transfer model suggest that reductions of 25-75% in summertime dissolved eplimnetic total mercury will likely allow fish tissue mercury concentrations to drop to the target level of 0.3 μg g^sup -1^ in a 40-cm fish in all lake segments. Changes in nutrient loading and ecosystem productivity in eutrophic segments may delay any response to reduced dissolved mercury and may result in increases in fish tissue mercury.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Integrated assessment of biomarker responses in caged shrimps (Litopenaeus vannamei) exposed to complex contaminants from the Maluan Bay of China
AN  - 929915154; 22234581
AB  - The marine shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei were used as an active biomonitoring organism to assess the bioavailability and impact of metal contaminants in seven study sites along the Maluan Bay of China. Metal concentrations in the hepatopancreas of shrimps were determined in conjunction with four biomarkers responses after a 7 day in situ cage exposures. The results showed that contaminant tissue burdens at the deployment sites were greater than those of the reference site, and antioxidant enzyme activities were strongly inhibited compared to those of reference organisms. Variations in these biomarker responses were correlated significantly (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01) with the specific metal pollutants at the study sites, but no significant correlations existed between catalase activity responses and the metal contaminants. This suggests the presence of undetermined contaminants or other exposure routes that may be responsible for the decreased catalase activity. Multivariate analysis revealed a causal relationship between contaminants at each deployment site and the biochemical "response" of the caged shrimps at these sites and demonstrated the presence of two contaminant "hot" spots. This investigation suggested that the incorporation of chemical data on trace metal concentrations with the analysis of antioxidant enzymatic activities in caged shrimps can be a useful tool for the identification of causal toxic contaminants in complex mixtures.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Differential ingestion of zooplankton by four species of bivalves (Mollusca) in the Mali Ston Bay, Croatia
AN  - 929148155
AB  - This study provides information about differences in composition of ingested zooplankton amongst bivalve species coexisting in the same area in a period from May 2009 to December 2010. The study was conducted at the Mali Ston Bay (42°51' N, 17°40' E)--the most important bivalve aquaculture area in the eastern Adriatic Sea. Stomach content analysis was performed on cultured species--Ostrea edulis and Mytilus galloprovincialis, and commercially important bivalve species from their natural environment--Modiolus barbatus and Arca noae. Results confirmed carnivory in bivalves, both from natural and cultured populations, but cultured species had higher numbers of zooplankters than those living on the seabed. The most abundant taxa were bivalve larvae, followed by tintinnids, copepods, unidentified eggs and gastropod larvae. Recorded numbers of bivalve larvae in M. galloprovincialis stomach were the highest so far reported and show that mussels impact the availability of natural spat.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Environmental genotoxicity and cytotoxicity studies in mussels before and after an oil spill at the marine oil terminal in the Baltic Sea
AN  - 923723702; 21660553
AB  - Environmental genotoxicity and cytotoxicity effects in the gills of mussels Mytilus edulis, from the Baltic Sea areas close to the Buting oil terminal (Lithuania) before and after accidental oil spill in 31 January 2008 were studied. Mussels from the oil spillage zones were collected in 12 days, in 3 and 6 months after the spill to determine the effects of the spill. Mussels sampled in 2006-2007 were used for the assessment of the background levels of genotoxicity and cytotoxicity in the Buting oil terminal area. Comparison of the responses in M. edulis before and after the oil spill revealed significant elevation of frequencies of micronuclei (MN), nuclear buds (NB) and fragmented-apoptotic (FA) cells. Environmental genotoxicity and cytotoxicity levels in mussels from the Palanga site before the accident (in June 2007) served as a reference. Six months after the accident, in July 2008, 5.6-fold increase of MN, 2.9-fold elevation of NB, and 8.8-fold elevation of FA cells were observed in mussels from the same site. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Organotin contamination in South American coastal areas
AN  - 917863480; 21544497
AB  - Organotin compounds (OT) were used in antifouling paints for more than four decades. However, due to their widespread intensive use and high toxicity, undesirable effects in non-target marine organisms have been detected since the early 1980s. Consequently, the International Maritime Organization banned new maritime applications of these products on January 1, 2003 and their presence on ship hulls from January 1, 2008. Although extensively studied in Europe, North America, Oceania, and Asia, environmental levels and effects of organotin contamination are still poorly known for South America. Thus, the current review aimed to present the actual status of this problem in South America by summarizing and comparing the available data in the literature. An overview of the OTs concentrations in sediment and biota and their effects, mainly imposex in marine gastropods, are presented. This work showed that in Atlantic coastal areas of South America there are "hot spots" of OTs contamination, similar to that observed in industrialized countries of Northern Hemisphere. On the other hand, the number of accomplished studies in the Pacific coast is extremely low. Despite the limitation on studies about OTs environmental levels and their related effects, the available data pointed out for a widespread TBT contamination along the South American coastal areas. Therefore, the establishment of baselines of organotin contamination in the Pacific coast and the implementation of temporal trend studies in the South American coastal areas is crucial to verify the effectiveness of local regulations and OTs global ban, and to map the most sensitive areas related to present and future antifouling impacts.

T1  - Stable isotope composition of the Miocene Dinaride Lake System deduced from its endemic mollusc fauna
AN  - 917322298
AB  - Issue Title: Evolution and Biodiversity in Ancient Lakes - Proceedings of the 5th Symposium on Speciation in Ancient Lakes, Ohrid, Macedonia, September 7-11, 2009

              
The aragonite shells of 55 mollusc specimens from the late Early and early Middle Miocene of two palaeolakes of the Dinaride Lake System (DLS) are analysed for their δ^sup 18^O and δ^sup 13^C signatures. The data set has a bimodal distribution with a prominent peak between -3 and -4[per thousand] for both isotopes and a second much weaker peak at more depleted values of c. -9 to -7[per thousand]. Taxa with 'heavy' values are interpreted to represent the inhabitants of the shores or shallow areas of the lake. Depleted values are attributed to species preferring freshwater habitats of springs or small rivulets, thus representing the freshwater end-member. The overall rather high values in both stable isotopes result from a combination of evaporation effects and the influx of already isotopically heavy freshwater from the karstic catchment area. Thus, the DLS is interpreted as a closed freshwater system without marine influence but with enough contribution of freshwater to keep the oxygen values close to -5[per thousand]. Mean lake surface water temperatures, based on the δ^sup 18^O^sub shell^ values, excluding the freshwater end-member taxa, range around roughly 19-21°C. Despite the problems in calculating these temperatures, the values are in agreement with mean annual air temperatures deduced from the palaeobotanic record by applying the Coexistence Approach method. The seasonal range was around 10-11°C and is mainly recorded in shells from lake settings. Taxa with freshwater end-member signatures lack this range due to the more stable temperature regime and less fluctuating dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) pool. Congeneric species from the same stratigraphic horizon often display discrete but different isotope signatures. This fact suggests habitat segregation and might be a major factor for sympatric speciation and the endemic radiation within the mollusc fauna of the DLS.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Seasonal variation in the effects of food availability on gametogenesis in the purple urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus)
AN  - 916310525
AB  - The amount of food and when it is available affect both the timing of reproduction and the number of gametes produced by purple sea urchins, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. To investigate this further, the effects of food availability on feeding rates, gonad growth, and gamete development were examined in S. purpuratus collected from the Point Loma kelp forest near San Diego, California, USA (32.69° N, 117.26° W) in September (Fall) 2007, and February (Spring) and July (Summer) 2008, using laboratory mesocosms. Each seasonal laboratory feeding experiment lasted 3 months, and different levels of food availability were established with different feeding frequencies (from 1 to 7 days week^sup -1^). Gonad tissues of male and female urchins were staged at the end of each experiment using histological analyses. Reduced food availability resulted in increased daily consumption rates, especially in the Fall when gamete development began. Food limitation at this time resulted in failure to produce viable gametes, suggesting there is a critical period early in gonad development when food limitation affects reproductive competency. Food limitation later in gonad development did not stop viable gamete production, although it did reduce gamete output.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Molecular Response of the Bloom-Forming Cyanobacterium, Microcystis aeruginosa, to Phosphorus Limitation
AN  - 914796643; 21720829
AB  - Cyanobacteria blooms caused by species such as Microcystis have become commonplace in many freshwater ecosystems. Although phosphorus (P) typically limits the growth of freshwater phytoplankton populations, little is known regarding the molecular response of Microcystis to variation in P concentrations and sources. For this study, we examined genes involved in P acquisition in Microcystis including two high-affinity phosphate-binding proteins (pstS and sphX) and a putative alkaline phosphatase (phoX). Sequence analyses among ten clones of Microcystis aeruginosa and one clone of Microcystis wesenbergii indicates that these genes are present and conserved within the species, but perhaps not the genus, as phoX was not identified in M. wesenbergii. Experiments with clones of M. aeruginosa indicated that expression of these three genes was strongly upregulated (50- to 400-fold) under low inorganic P conditions and that the expression of phoX was correlated with alkaline phosphatase activity (p<0.005). In contrast, cultures grown exclusively on high levels of organic phosphorus sources (adenosine 5'-monophosphate, β-glycerol phosphate, and d-glucose-6-phosphate) or under nitrogen-limited conditions displayed neither high levels of gene expression nor alkaline phosphatase activity. Since Microcystis dominates phytoplankton assemblages in summer when levels of inorganic P (P^sub i^) are often low and/or dominate lakes with low P^sub i^ and high organic P, our findings suggest this cyanobacterium may rely on pstS, sphX, and phoX to efficiently transport P^sub i^ and exploit organic sources of P to form blooms.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Modelling the impact of toxic and disturbance stress on white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) populations
AN  - 914305765; 21861166
AB  - Several studies have related breeding success and survival of sea eagles to toxic or non-toxic stress separately. In the present investigation, we analysed single and combined impacts of both toxic and disturbance stress on populations of white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla), using an analytical single-species model. Chemical and eco(toxico)logical data reported from laboratory and field studies were used to parameterise and validate the model. The model was applied to assess the impact of ∑PCB, DDE and disturbance stress on the white-tailed eagle population in The Netherlands. Disturbance stress was incorporated through a 1.6% reduction in survival and a 10-50% reduction in reproduction. ∑PCB contamination from 1950 up to 1987 was found to be too high to allow the return of white-tailed eagle as a breeding species in that period. ∑PCB and population trends simulated for 2006-2050 suggest that future population growth is still reduced. Disturbance stress resulted in a reduced population development. The combination of both toxic and disturbance stress varied from a slower population development to a catastrophical reduction in population size, where the main cause was attributed to the reduction in reproduction of 50%. Application of the model was restricted by the current lack of quantitative dose-response relationships between non-toxic stress and survival and reproduction. Nevertheless, the model provides a first step towards integrating and quantifying the impacts of multiple stressors on white-tailed eagle populations.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Spicule records of Ephydatia fluviatilis as a proxy for hydrological and environmental changes in the shallow Lake Trasimeno (Umbria, Italy)hydro
AN  - 906335497
AB  - This research shows the results of an analysis of siliceous spicules found in sediment cores collected in Lake Trasimeno (Umbria, Italy), a shallow lake that experienced an important water level lowering during the last century. A morphological analysis of sedimentary sponge records revealed that the spicules accumulated in the lake sediments over the last 150 years are attributable to Ephydatia fluviatilis, the only sponge species found in the lake in recent years. The stratigraphic analysis of the cores showed that the abundance and size of the sponge spicules (megascleres) have remarkably decreased, suggesting that a significant depletion of the sponge fauna occurred, particularly during the first half of the twentieth century. A correlation analysis has identified morpho-hydrological and related variables (the theoretical fraction of lake surface subjected to resuspension and the amount of total suspended solids) as the most significant factors explaining the change in density of sponge spicules. Two ecological explanations of the sponge decline are proposed, based on the sensitivity of the sponge both to the availability of suitable hard substrata for colonization, and to the amount of wind-resuspended solids. One-ended sigmoid response curves were obtained by regression and corresponding transfer functions were derived, which allow the mean water depth of the lake and total suspended solids to be inferred from spicule density records. The results support the use of sponge spicules as a paleohydrological and paleoecological proxy, application of which appears particularly promising for shallow-water systems.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Findings on American Shad and Striped Bass in the Hudson River Estuary: A Fish Community Study of the Long‐Term Effects of Local Hydrology and Regional Climate Change
AN  - 2290342495
AB  - It has been hypothesized that climate change is an underlying factor in determining fish abundances in the Hudson River estuary (HRE). To study the effects of hydrology and climate on the HRE fish community, we applied multivariate statistical methods to data on 20 species–life history stages collected from 1974 to 2005. We confirm that the HRE fish community has changed over this period. These changes are correlated with local hydrology (freshwater flow and water temperature) and regional climate (the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation [AMO] and North Atlantic Oscillation). We found that the abundances of striped bass Morone saxatilis larval stages are positively correlated with high freshwater flows and those of juvenile American shad Alosa sapidissima negatively correlated with the AMO or warmer sea surface temperatures. Our findings suggest that climate‐related variability affects HRE juvenile shad abundances and that management strategies for this declining species should include the implications of climate change.Received March 19, 2011; accepted January 10, 2012

T1  - Incorporating spatial variation of nitrification and denitrification rates into whole-lake nitrogen dynamics
AN  - 1115786278
AB  - Despite dramatic increases in nitrogen (N) loading to fresh waters and growing scientific attention on the changing N cycle, measurements of nitrification and denitrification rates in lakes are lacking. In particular, we know little about how these processes vary spatially within a lake, and how this potential spatial variation contributes to a lake's N dynamics. We measured sediment nitrification and denitrification rates at 40 sites in Gull Lake, Michigan (USA), and found that the shallow edge sediments (<2 m deep) of the lake were hot spots of N transformation. Nitrification rates were comparable in sediments at all depths, while sediment denitrification rates were highest in the shallow edge habitat, and lowest in the profundal sediments (<2 m and >10 m deep, respectively). We scaled-up our sediment transformation rates across the lake to illustrate spatial variability in nitrification and denitrification. For whole-lake nitrification, the contribution of shallow edge, littoral, and profundal sediments followed in proportion to lake surface area of each habitat. In contrast, the contribution of each of these areas to whole-lake denitrification was not proportional to their respective surface areas, and instead was equal across the 3 habitat types, with each area contributing roughly 30% of the total N loss via denitrification. Spatially representative characterization of nitrification and denitrification in lentic ecosystems requires incorporation of the spatial variation in these transformations with a particular focus on littoral sediments, and this is often overlooked in studies of lentic N cycling. Furthermore, anthropogenic changes to lake shorelines that influence N cycling in littoral sediments may have a disproportionate effect on whole-lake ecosystem function.

T1  - Application of magnetic resonance imaging in zoology
AN  - 2261511968
AB  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a noninvasive imaging technique that today constitutes one of the main pillars of preclinical and clinical imaging. MRI’s capacity to depict soft tissue in whole specimens ex vivo as well as in vivo, achievable voxel resolutions well below (100 μm)3, and the absence of ionizing radiation have resulted in the broad application of this technique both in human diagnostics and studies involving small animal model organisms. Unfortunately, MRI systems are expensive devices and have so far only sporadically been used to resolve questions in zoology and in particular in zoomorphology. However, the results from two recent studies involving systematic scanning of representative species from a vertebrate group (fishes) as well as an invertebrate taxon (sea urchins) suggest that MRI could in fact be used more widely in zoology. Using novel image data derived from representative species of numerous higher metazoan clades in combination with a comprehensive literature survey, we review and evaluate the potential of MRI for systematic taxon scanning. According to our results, numerous animal groups are suitable for systematic MRI scanning, among them various cnidarian and arthropod taxa, brachiopods, various molluscan taxa, echinoderms, as well as all vertebrate clades. However, various phyla in their entirety cannot be considered suitable for this approach mainly due to their small size (e.g., Kinorhyncha) or their unfavorable shape (e.g., Nematomorpha), while other taxa are prone to produce artifacts associated either with their biology (e.g., Echiura) or their anatomy (e.g., Polyplacophora). In order to initiate further uses of MRI in zoology, we outline the principles underlying various applications of this technique such as the use of contrast agents, in vivo MRI, functional MRI, as well as magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Finally, we discuss how future technical developments might shape the use of MRI for the study of zoological specimens.

T1  - Cyanotoxins: Bioaccumulation and Effects on Aquatic Animals
AN  - 1536074786
AB  - Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic prokaryotes with wide geographic distribution that can produce secondary metabolites named cyanotoxins. These toxins can be classified into three main types according to their mechanism of action in vertebrates: hepatotoxins, dermatotoxins and neurotoxins. Many studies on the effects of cyanobacteria and their toxins over a wide range of aquatic organisms, including invertebrates and vertebrates, have reported acute effects (e.g., reduction in survivorship, feeding inhibition, paralysis), chronic effects (e.g., reduction in growth and fecundity), biochemical alterations (e.g., activity of phosphatases, GST, AChE, proteases), and behavioral alterations. Research has also focused on the potential for bioaccumulation and transferring of these toxins through the food chain. Although the herbivorous zooplankton is hypothesized as the main target of cyanotoxins, there is not unquestionable evidence of the deleterious effects of cyanobacteria and their toxins on these organisms. Also, the low toxin burden in secondary consumers points towards biodilution of microcystins in the food web as the predominant process. In this broad review we discuss important issues on bioaccumulation and the effects of cyanotoxins, with emphasis on microcystins, as well as drawbacks and future needs in this field of research.

T1  - Dispersal potential of invasive algae: the determinants of buoyancy in Codium fragile ssp. fragile
AN  - 899312159
AB  - The capacity for long-distance dispersal is an important factor in determining the spread of invasive species. For algae, positive buoyancy generally is correlated with increased dispersal potential, and the light environment has been previously identified as a possible determinant of buoyancy in several species. We examined the effect of light intensity on the buoyancy of fragments of the invasive green alga Codium fragile ssp. fragile. Under natural and controlled conditions, the buoyancy of samples taken from the thallus tip was higher than those from near the holdfast. Both laboratory and field experiments also showed that buoyancy was dynamic and switched from positive to negative under reduced light intensity, but this change required several days. We also observed seasonal changes in buoyancy, presumably due to natural variations in light intensity, with the buoyancy of fragments washed up on the shore highest in mid-summer. These results show that buoyancy is a dynamic property of the C. fragile ssp. fragile thallus and suggest that buoyant fragments contribute to long-range dispersal and accelerated regional spread of this invader. This finding suggests that dispersal is more likely during conditions of high light intensity and illustrates the need to understand how variations in the natural environment can affect the dispersal potential of invasive species.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - A multi-biomarker approach in cross-transplanted mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis
AN  - 898688570; 21769590
AB  - The present work integrates the active biomonitoring (ABM) concept in mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis from the South coast of Portugal transplanted during 28 days between two sites with different sources of contamination, and vice versa, in order to assess biological effects in these mussels. For that purpose a multibiomarker approach was used. The suit of biomarkers indicative of metal contamination were metallothioneins (MT) and the enzyme δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD), for organic contamination mixed function oxidase system (MFO), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE), as oxidative stress biomarkers superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and lipid peroxidation (LPO). These biomarkers were used to determine an index to evaluate the stress levels in these two sites. Site A is strongly influenced by metallic contamination, with higher Cu, Cr and Pb in M. galloprovinciallis, as well as higher MT levels, antioxidant enzymes activities and LPO concentrations, and lower ALAD activity. In site B organic compounds (PAHs) are prevalent and native mussels show higher activities of the MFO system components and GST. Transplanted mussels had significant alterations in some biomarkers that reflect the type of contaminants present in each site, which demonstrates the primary role of the environment in determining the physiological characteristics of resident mussels. Therefore the application of ABM using a battery of biomarkers turns out to be a useful approach in sites where usually complex mixtures of contaminants occurs. In this study the biomarkers that better differentiate the impact of different contaminants at each site were MT, CYP450, SOD and CAT.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Effects of Pollution on Marine Organisms
AN  - 926252745
AB  - This review covers selected 2010 articles on the biological, chemical and physical effects of natural and anthropogenic pollutants on marine and estuarine plants and animals. The review, based largely on journal articles, covers field and laboratory measurement activities (concentrations of contaminants, field surveys, toxicity testing and biomarkers). Reviewed papers focus further on pollution issues of current interest including endocrine disrupters, wastewater discharges, dredging and disposal, etc. Special emphasis is placed on oil spills due to the catastrophic Deepwater Horizon blowout in the Gulf of Mexico and ongoing cleanup. Several topical areas reviewed in the past were dropped this year due to circumstances beyond our control. Further, the focus is limited to effects, not on pollutant fate and transport. There is considerable overlap across subject areas (e.g. some bioaccumulation papers may be cited in other topical categories). As always, readers should only use this as a guide and must consult the original papers before citing them, including double-checking units. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

The changes in the morpho-functional state of mollusks at the impact of these metals are distinguished. These changes included a 60% decrease in the hemocytes' concentration in the hemolymph and a 5- to 7-fold decline of the hemocyte adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content, along with the appearance in the mollusks of "brown" cells and lipofuscin-like pigment. The exposure to both metals caused similar changes.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Spatiotemporal trends of mercury in walleye and largemouth bass from the Laurentian Great Lakes Region
AN  - 890407948; 21706250
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Mercury in the Great Lakes

              
The risk of mercury (Hg) exposure to humans and wildlife from fish consumption has driven extensive mercury analysis throughout the Great Lakes Region since the 1970s. This study compiled fish-Hg data from multiple sources in the region and assessed spatiotemporal trends of Hg concentrations in two representative top predator fish species. Walleye (Sander vitreus) and largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) were chosen for the trend analysis because they had more Hg records (63,872) than other fish species that had been sampled from waters throughout the region. Waterbody types were inland lakes (70%), the Great Lakes, impoundments, and rivers. The compiled datasets were analyzed with a mixed effects statistical model having random effects of station, year, and fish length; and fixed effects of year, tissue type, fish length, habitat, and season. The results showed a generally declining temporal trend in fish-Hg for the region (1970-2009), with spatial trends of increasing Hg concentration from south to north and from west to east across the region. Nonlinearity was evident in the general downward trends of Ontario walleye, with a shift to an upward trend beginning in the 1990s. Only ongoing monitoring can reveal if this upward shift is an oscillation in a long-term decline, a statistical anomaly, or a sustained declining temporal trend in regional fish-Hg concentrations.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Mercury temporal trends in top predator fish of the Laurentian Great Lakes
AN  - 890406681; 21792660
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Mercury in the Great Lakes

              
Mercury (Hg) contamination is widespread in the Laurentian Great Lakes region and is a serious environmental concern. In anaerobic environments such as lake sediments, mercury is transformed into methylmercury (MeHg) and can biomagnify up the food chain to toxic concentrations. The Great Lakes Fish Monitoring Program (GLFMP), administered by the US EPA Great Lakes National Program Office (GLNPO), aims to monitor temporal trends of mercury in the five Great Lakes using top predator fish as biomonitors. Total Hg (THg) concentrations were measured in Great Lake fish collected between 1999 and 2009. Single factor ANOVA determined that average fish THg concentrations over this time period in the five lakes were significantly different from one another in the order of Superior > Huron > Michigan > Ontario > Erie. By fitting the data to three different models (linear, quadratic, and two-segment piecewise), it was determined that Hg concentrations in top predator fish (lake trout, or walleye in Lake Erie) are currently increasing in Lake Erie and the Apostle Island sampling site in Lake Superior. Significant decreasing trends are evident in Lakes Michigan, Ontario, and the Rockport sampling site in Lake Huron, although all of the lakes exhibit elevated concentrations in fish compared to historic concentrations. As new Hg emission controls are implemented in the US, continued monitoring of Hg in Great Lakes fish will be needed to determine if they influence the current concentrations and trends.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Phytoplankton abundance and contributions to suspended particulate matter in the Ohio, Upper Mississippi and Missouri Rivers
AN  - 878540209
AB  - Main channel habitats of the Ohio, Missouri, and Upper Mississippi Rivers were surveyed during the summers of 2004, 2005 and 2006 using a probability-based sampling design to characterize inter-annual and inter-river variation in suspended chlorophyll a (CHLa) and related variables. Large (fivefold) differences in CHLa were observed with highest concentrations in the Upper Mississippi (32.3 ± 1.8 μg L^sup -1^), intermediate values in the Missouri (19.7 ± 1.1 μg L^sup -1^) and lowest concentrations in the Ohio (6.8 ± 0.5 μg L^sup -1^). Inter-annual variation was small in comparison to inter-river differences suggesting that basin-specific factors exert greater control over river-wide CHLa than regional-scale processes influencing climate and discharge. The rivers were characterized by variable but generally low light conditions as indicated by depth-averaged underwater irradiance <4 E m^sup -2^ day^sup -1^ and high ratios of channel depth to euphotic depth (>3). Despite poor light conditions, regression analyses revealed that TP was the best single predictor of CHLa (R ^sup 2^ = 0.40), though models incorporating both light and TP performed better (R ^sup 2^ = 0.60). Light and nutrient conditions varied widely within rivers and were inversely related, suggesting that riverine phytoplankton may experience shifts in resource limitation during transport. Inferred grazing and sedimentation losses were large yet CHLa concentrations did not decline downriver indicating that growth and loss processes were closely coupled. The contribution by algae to suspended particulate organic matter in these rivers (mean = 41%) was similar to that of lakes (39%) but lower relative to reservoirs (61%).[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Assessing the effects of Cu, Cd, and exposure period on metallothionein production in gills of the Brazilian brown mussel Perna perna by using factorial design
AN  - 876254784; 20976552
AB  - Factorial design plan was experimented in Perna perna in order to find out the contribution of day exposure, Cd and Cu concentrations in water, and their interactions on metallothioneins (MT), Cd, and Cu (the dependent measured variables) in the gills. The picture obtained is more adequate than by studying the factor effect separately. Compared with the control group, the MT concentration after 22 days exposure period in the mixture of 100 μg/mL Cu and Cd is increased almost two times, showing that P. perna might be used as a biomonitor. Cd showed stronger effect than Cu on MT inducing. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Relationship between element concentrations and body size in the Lake Maggiore population of Unio pictorum mancus (Mollusca, Bivalvia)
AN  - 2417742920
AB  - The study focused on using a fresh-water mussel (Unio pictorum mancus) as a bioindicator of various pollutants, and particularly metals. The elements considered were: Al, As, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, V and Zn. This research was carried out at a site where various other studies have been conducted on important characteristics of the same population of Unio. This site is a small bay called "Sabbie d’Oro" located on the south-east coast of Lake Maggiore. Our study involved quantifying the capacity of this mollusc to concentrate large amounts of metal in its body without evident consequences by using detoxification mechanisms. We analysed not only element concentrations, but also their variability (expressed as CV%) in the soft tissues and in the shell, for two main reasons: i) the sampling design should include a preliminary analysis to determine how many specimens is necessary collect to ensure a specified level of precision; ii) the sample variability value may be combined with the value of analytical precision (BCR) to obtain an estimate of the "experimental" precision. In soft tissue, Ca accumulation tended to increase with size, and Al accumulation decreased with size. In shell, Ca and Ni were stored more than in soft tissue, but not proportionally to size. V, Cr and Mo tended to accumulate in the shell progressively over the years, whereas Co and Al are "diluted" during growth, or are absorbed mainly during the juvenile stage. Partition between shell and soft tissue resulted roughly the same in the juvenile and adult stages for the following elements: Fe, Al, Co, As, Pb. The relationships among the various elements were schematized in a hierarchical tree plot.

T1  - Colonization and Effects of Garlic Mustard (Alliaria petiolata), European Buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica), and Bell's Honeysuckle (Lonicera × bella) on Understory Plants After Five Decades in Southern Wisconsin Forests
AN  - 891706740
AB  - Preinvasion baseline data on entire communities are absent for most taxa in most places, and this limits our ability to connect long-term ecological changes to particular invasive species or invasion events. We obtained data on forest understory composition from 94 stands in the 1950s and again the 2000s. We recorded within-stand frequency of occurrence for garlic mustard, European buckthorn, and Bell's honeysuckle and identified changes in native plant species density in 20, 1-m^sup 2^ quadrats in invaded and noninvaded stands. All three invasive species were absent from all study sites 50 yr ago, yet at least one was present in 77.7% of the stands by the 2000s. All three species were present in 14.9% of the stands. Garlic mustard and European buckthorn were found at 47.9% of resurveyed sites, and Bell's honeysuckle was found in 40.4% of resurveyed sites. Native understory plant species density declined an average of 23.1% during the past 50 yr. Declines were not significantly different in stands with or without invasive plants. The absence of a measurable effect by invasive plant presence or frequency could be due to invasive plants being too few to have a measurable effect at the plot scale, species density being an insensitive response variable, time lags between invasions and effects, or regional factors like development pressure and fire suppression driving density declines in both invasives and native species.

T1  - Longshore Sediment Movement and Supply along the U.S. Shoreline of Lake Erie
AN  - 880233573
AB  - To establish existing conditions for dredge material beneficial use projects and to help implement principles of Regional Sediment Management (RSM) into projects and studies, this paper is an assessment of sediment sources and sinks, physical processes, and longshore sediment transport along the west and south shore of Lake Erie. This summary compiles information from a widely scattered technical literature and synthesizes the results in preparation for development of a sediment budget. The U.S. shore of Lake Erie has 28 river or harbor mouths protected with jetties and structures, of which 16 are Federal navigation projects. Much of the sediment management since the mid-1800s has revolved around providing safe navigation, maintaining depth in navigation channels, and disposing of the dredged material. Sediment sources include material brought down the rivers (often fine-grained); industrial dumping and runoff from sewers, gravel, sand, and clay eroded from glacial till bluffs and clay banks; sediment created in situ from bedrock bluff weathering (primarily from shale); and limited supply from lake bed lowering and offshore outcrops. Losses include wave- and ice-induced transport to deep water, sediment trapped in fillets at harbor jetties, sediment dredged from harbor entrance channel and placed in confined disposal facilities (CDFs) or placed offshore, bluff armoring, and (formerly) beach mining. Today, the south shore of Lake Erie is severely sand-starved compared with conditions that existed 200 years ago. The lack of available sediment is largely due to man-made causes. As the shore developed and became urbanized after the mid-1800s, residents, industries, and municipalities attempted to arrest bluff erosion with the use of structures and vegetation. Now the U.S. shoreline of Lake Erie is almost 83% protected, a larger percentage than any ocean coast except in urban areas. It means that little sediment exchange occurs compared with predeveloped conditions, which, in turn, means that managers must recycle and reuse existing sediment to maintain recreation beaches. Managing sediment to benefit a region sustainably potentially will save money, allow use of natural processes to solve engineering problems, and improve recreation resources and natural habitat.

T1  - Land Use and Basin Characteristics Determine the Composition and Abundance of the Microzooplankton
AN  - 867341438
AB  - The influence of watershed land use on microzooplankton was examined. Six rivers and a shallow lake located in rural (agriculture, livestock) and urban areas were sampled during 4 weeks at low water, low temperatures and 3 weeks at high water, high temperatures. The major aim of this study was to analyze the composition, richness and abundance of the microzooplankton in relation to land use, taking into account nutrient concentration, biological oxygen demand (BOD^sub 5^), conductivity, pH, transparency, dissolved oxygen, and chlorophyll-a. Redundancy analysis was used to assess microzooplankton response to environmental gradients. The composition and abundance can be considered good indicators of the land used and characteristic of the basin (broad range of conductivity water). The species composition show a gradient along the conductivity, pH and chlorophyll-a. Brachionus spp. were associated with saline waters on rural area and Keratella spp. (except Keratella tropica) were associated with urban water bodies. The microzooplankton abundance diminished by a factor of ten from the rivers in livestock-agriculture-dominated watersheds to those located in strictly urban areas. Urban rivers had low abundances of chlorophyll-a and microzooplankton despite the high concentration of nutrients. However, the effect of urbanization (mesotrophic/mesosaprobious state and lead presence) cannot be analyzed alone due to the potential effect of a filter-feeding invasive mollusk that colonizes the hard surfaces of harbor buildings and bridge pillars.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Use of three bivalve species for biomonitoring a polluted estuarine environment
AN  - 867326962; 20686838
AB  - Estuaries are marine areas at great contamination risk due to their hydrodynamic features. PAH are wide and ubiquitous contaminants with a high presence in these marine environments. Chemical analysis of sediments can provide information, although it does not give a direct measure of the toxicological effect of such contaminants in the biota. Samples of Venerupis pullastra, Cerastoderma edule, and Mytilus galloprovincialis were collected from two locations in Corcubión estuary (Norhwest of Spain). The level of PAH in sediment and biota, and its possible origin were assessed. A moderate level of contamination was observed with a predominance of PAH of a pyrogenic origin. Genotoxic damage, measured as single-strand DNA breaks with the comet assay, was evaluated in gill tissue and in hemolymph. The values of DNA damage obtained showed a higher sensitivity of clams and cockles to the pollution load level. These differences among species make us suggest the use of some other species coupled with mussels as an optimal tool for biomonitoring estuarine environments.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Review on Methods for Determination of Metallothioneins in Aquatic Organisms
AN  - 867319366; 20607442
AB  - One aspect of environmental degradation in coastal areas is pollution from toxic metals, which are persistent and are bioaccumulated by marine organisms, with serious public health implications. A conventional monitoring system of environmental metal pollution includes measuring the level of selected metals in the whole organism or in respective organs. However, measuring only the metal content in particular organs does not give information about its effect at the subcellular level. Therefore, the evaluation of biochemical biomarker metallothionein may be useful in assessing metal exposure and the prediction of potential detrimental effects induced by metal contamination. There are some methods for the determination of metallothioneins including spectrophotometric method, electrochemical methods, chromatography, saturation-based methods, immunological methods, electrophoresis, and RT-PCR. In this paper, different methods are discussed briefly and the comparison between them will be presented.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - "Dead Zone" dynamics in Lake Erie: the importance of weather and sampling intensity for calculated hypolimnetic oxygen depletion rates
AN  - 862804663
AB  - Calculated hypolimnetic oxygen depletion (HOD) rates depend not only on environmental factors but also logistical ones. In particular, lack of understanding of the effects of weather in addition to how sampling effort determines calculated HOD rates complicates ecological understanding and environmental management of lake ecosystems. To better determine the roles of weather and sampling effort, we combined (1) weekly measurements of temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations from seven stations in the Sandusky subbasin of Lake Erie's central basin during 2005, (2) contemporaneous measures of storm activity and tributary discharge, and (3) a two-dimensional coupled hydrodynamic, chemical, and biological model of Lake Erie to investigate (1) how increased storm activity and tributary discharge affected short- (daily) and long-term (seasonal) dynamics of hypolimnetic hypoxia, and (2) how spatial (number of sites sampled) and temporal (sampling frequency) sampling effort affected calculated HOD rates. Our model closely replicated field-observed DO dynamics. When comparing baseline modeled dynamics to those in a second simulation with twice the number of days with high winds, however, we found that with more storm activity (1) periods of entrainment became more frequent, (2) the hypolimnion was warmer, (3) thermal stratification occurred 1 month later, whereas autumnal turnover occurred at least 1 week earlier shortening the duration of stratification by 1-2 months, and (4) HOD rates increased 12%. Further, spatial and temporal sampling intensity also affected calculated HOD rates. Consequently, adequately quantifying actual HOD rates requires sufficient sampling effort and the particular role of weather should be assessed with rigorous field and simulation studies, especially if HOD rates are used to indicate management success.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Parasite-mediated intraguild predation as one of the drivers of co-existence and exclusion among invasive and native amphipods (Crustacea)
AN  - 857330251
AB  - Parasitism is emerging as one of the forces determining the outcome of biological invasions. Using field survey and laboratory experiments, we investigate parasitism as one of the factors mediating the interactions among invasive and native amphipods. An extensive survey (100 sites) of a small British island, revealed the native Gammarus duebeni celticus to be parasitised by the muscle wasting microsporidian Pleistophora mulleri and the acanthocephalan duck parasite Polymorphus minutus, the introduced European Gammarus pulex only by P. minutus and the North American Crangonyx pseudogracilis by neither. While Gammarus spp. were widespread in rivers (one or both species present in 64% of sites), C. pseudogracilis had a restricted distribution (7% of sites) and always co-occurred with Gammarus spp. In contrast, Gammarus spp. were absent from all pond/reservoir sites, with C. pseudogracilis present in over 90%. While the negative association of C. pseudogracilis with Gammarus spp. undoubtedly results from factors such as physico-chemical tolerance and predation as C. pseudogracilis can be heavily predated by Gammarus spp., it was notable that C. pseudogracilis co-occurred with Gammarus spp. more frequently when the latter were parasitised. Laboratory experiments clearly showed that predation on C. pseudogracilis was greatly diminished when G. d. celticus was parasitised by P. mulleri and G. pulex by P. minutus. Our study provides evidence that parasitism, by mediating a key interspecific interaction, is one of an array of interacting factors that may have a role in driving patterns of exclusion and co-existence in natives and invaders.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Deep inclined water intake shafts at the Navajo Generating Station
AN  - 858369524
AB  - Scrubbers were installed to the plant in the 1990s as part of a $420~million environmental upgrade.  Because of this upgrade, the NGS is now one of the cleanest operating coal-fired power plants in the country.  [...] a 12-m- (40-ft-) long, 61 -cm- (24in.-) diameter mandrel modeled to be the same size as the intake pumps that the shafts would house was lowered and raised within each of the shafts to ensure that the pump would fit and there were no kinks that would impede installation or removal.

T1  - Assessing metal, protein, and DNA profiles in Labeo rohita from the Indus River in Mianwali, Pakistan
AN  - 848540873; 20461548
AB  - This study assessed metals in water and different tissues of Labeo rohita and the impact of these metals on DNA and proteins as biomarkers of gills and muscles of these fish from three different polluted sites (reference or low = KW, medium = CH and high = SK) of the Indus River, Pakistan. The Mn, Pb, Cu, Zn, Hg, and Cr levels in water, gills, liver, muscles, and skin of these fish were compared with the international permissible levels. All metals except Pb and Hg in water were within the acceptable limits of drinking water. In contrast, the Mn, Hg, and Cr levels in the fish tissues were higher than their permissible limits for fish as a human food. Here, the gills contained higher metals than the other tissues. Different patterns of biomarkers were found in fish from these sites. While the gills did not show four protein bands (55, 30, 18.4, and 16.4 kDa), the muscles showed four new protein bands (100, 85, 45, and 20 kDa) for fish from the medium and high polluted sites as compared to the reference or low polluted site. The fish from the CH and SK sites of the Indus River contained low molecular weight DNA in their gills but high molecular weight DNA in their muscles when compared with the KW site. This study suggests that the proteins and DNA profiles of L. rohita could be used as biomarkers to assess the impact of potential environmental stressors such as metals on the freshwater systems.

T1  - Estimating benthic invertebrate production in lakes: a comparison of methods and scaling from individual taxa to the whole-lake level
AN  - 847982267
AB  - Studies of aquatic invertebrate production have been primarily conducted at the level of individual taxa or populations. Advancing our understanding of the functioning and energy flow in aquatic ecosystems necessitates scaling-up to community and whole-lake levels, as well as integrating across benthic and pelagic habitats and across multiple trophic levels. In this paper, we compare a suite of non-cohort based methods for estimating benthic invertebrate production at subpopulation, habitat, and whole-lake levels for Sparkling Lake, WI, USA. Estimates of the overall mean benthic invertebrate production (i.e. whole-lake level) ranged from 1.9 to 5.0 g DM m^sup -2^ y^sup -1^, depending on the method. Production estimates varied widely among depths and habitats, and there was general qualitative agreement among methods with regards to differences in production among habitats. However, there were also consistent and systematic differences among methods. The size-frequency method gave the highest, while the regression model of Banse and Mosher (Ecol Monogr 50:355-379, 1980) gave the lowest production estimates. The regression model of Plante and Downing (Can J Fish Aquat Sci 46:1489-1498, 1989) had the lowest average coefficients of variation at habitat (CV = 0.17) and whole-lake (CV = 0.08) levels. At the habitat level, variance in production estimates decreased with sampling effort, with little improvement after 10-15 samples. Our study shows how different production estimates can be generated from the same field data, though aggregating estimates up to the whole-lake level does produce an averaging effect that tends to reduce variance.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Otolith trace element and stable isotopic compositions differentiate fishes from the Middle Mississippi River, its tributaries, and floodplain lakes
AN  - 816195694
AB  - Naturally occurring stable isotope and trace elemental markers in otoliths have emerged as powerful tools for determining natal origins and environmental history of fishes in a variety of marine and freshwater environments. However, few studies have examined the applicability of this technique in large river-floodplain ecosystems. This study evaluated otolith microchemistry and stable isotopic composition as tools for determining environmental history of fishes in the Middle Mississippi River, its tributaries, and floodplain lakes in Illinois and Missouri, USA. Fishes were collected from 14 sites and water samples obtained from 16 sites during summer and fall 2006 and spring 2007. Otolith and water samples were analyzed for stable oxygen isotopic composition (δ^sup 18^O) and concentrations of a suite of trace elements; otoliths were also analyzed for carbon isotopic composition (δ^sup 13^C). Tributaries, floodplain lakes, and the Mississippi and Lower Missouri Rivers possessed distinct isotopic and elemental signatures that were reflected in fish otoliths. Fish from tributaries on the Missouri and Illinois sides of the middle Mississippi River could also be distinguished from one another by their elemental and isotopic fingerprints. Linear discriminant function analysis of otolith chemical signatures indicated that fish could be classified back to their environment of capture (Mississippi River, floodplain lake, tributary on the Illinois or Missouri side of the Mississippi River, or lower Missouri River) with 71-100% accuracy. This study demonstrates the potential applicability of otolith microchemistry and stable isotope analyses to determine natal origins and describe environmental history of fishes in the Middle Mississippi River, its tributaries, and floodplain lakes. The ability to reconstruct environmental history of individual fish using naturally occurring isotopic markers in otoliths may also facilitate efforts to quantify nutrient and energy subsidies to the Mississippi River provided by fishes that emigrate from floodplain lakes or tributaries.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Thermal tolerance of Limnoperna fortunei to gradual temperature increase and its applications for biofouling control in industrial and power plants
AN  - 902337362; 15679253
AB  - The acute upper lethal temperature (AULT) at different rates of increase was evaluated as a tool for the design of cheaper and environmentally friendlier control strategies for the invasive bivalve Limnoperna fortunei. Survivorship of 6 ? 2 mm and 20 ? 2 mm mussels acclimated to 12, 23 and 28?C and subjected to different heating rates (1?C per 5, 15 and 30 min) was estimated in the laboratory. The temperatures required to kill 50% (LT50) and 100% (SM100) of the mussels, and the mean death temperature (MDT) varied between 42.2 and 51?C over 54 experiments. Heating rates significantly (p < 0.001) affected LT50, SM100, and MDT. AULT was not affected by mussel size and acclimation temperatures. Limnoperna appears to be more resistant to high temperatures than Dreissena polymorpha, a mussel invasive in the USA and Europe. Lethal temperatures of L. fortunei are within the current thermal operational industrial capacities, suggesting that heat treatment is a viable alternative for controlling its fouling in utility systems.

T1  - Crayfish learning abilities: how does familiarization period affect the capture rate of a new prey item?
AN  - 856595350
AB  - This study explores the effect of the length of learning period on capture rate of a previously unfamiliar prey by an invasive freshwater crayfish (Procambarus clarkii). Juvenile crayfish were subjected to different periods of contact (learning period) with a larvae prey (Chaoborus sp.). The length of the learning period significantly affected the number of prey consumed by the predator. Our results indicate that the naive crayfish require less than 12 h to learn to maximize capture rate of this prey. The learning coefficient, adopted in the present study, may be useful in exploring predation capabilities of alien species in newly invaded habitats.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Benthic Macrophyte Distribution and Abundance in Estuarine Mangrove Lakes and Estuaries: Relationships to Environmental Variables
AN  - 821601200
AB  - Annual mean salinity, light availability, and sediment depth to bedrock structured the submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) communities in subtropical mangrove-lined estuaries. Three distinct SAV communities (i.e., Chara group, Halodule group, and Low SAV coverage group) were identified along the Everglades-Florida Bay ecotone and related to water quality using a discriminant function model that predicted the type of plant community at a given site from salinity, light availability, and sediment depth to bedrock. Mean salinity alone was able to correctly classify 78% of the sites and reliably separated the Chara group from the Halodule group. The addition of light availability and sediment depth to bedrock increased model accuracy to 90% and further distinguished the Chara group from the Halodule group. Light availability was uniquely valuable in separating the Chara group from the Low SAV coverage group. Regression analyses identified significant relationships between phosphorus concentration, phytoplankton abundance, and light availability and suggest that a decline in water transparency, associated with increasing salinity, may have also contributed to the historical decline of Chara communities in the region. This investigation applies relationships between environmental variables and SAV distribution and provides a case study into the application of these general principals to ecosystem management.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

In the early 1990s, polycyclic musks were reported to occur in air, water, sediment, wildlife, and humans from many European countries. Concentrations of polycyclic musks, particularly 1,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydro-4,6,6,7,8,8-hexamethyl-cyclopenta-[γ]-2-benzopyran (HHCB) and 7-acetyl-1,1,3,4,4,6-hexamethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronapthalene (AHTN), have been reported to increase over time in the environment. In this study, concentrations of musks in water, sediment, fish, and mussel were determined from three locations along the upper Hudson River. HHCB and AHTN were detected in water (n=5; 3.95-25.8 and 5.09-22.8 ng/L, respectively), sediment (n=3; 72.8-388 and 113-544 ng/g, dry weight), fish (n=30; <1-125 and <1-32.8 ng/g, lipid weight), and zebra mussel (n=4; 10.3-19.3 and 42.2-65.9 ng/g, lipid weight) samples. Bioaccumulation factors of HHCB calculated for white perch, catfish, smallmouth bass, and largemouth bass were in the range of 18 to 371, when the concentrations in fish were expressed on a wet weight basis; the factors were in the range of 261 to 12,900, when the concentrations in fish were expressed on a lipid weight basis.

T1  - Using Stable Isotope Mixing in a Great Lakes Coastal Tributary to Determine Food Web Linkages in Young Fishes
AN  - 882048427
AB  - Issue Title: Special Feature: Long-term Recovery of Marine Systems. Guest Editors: Ángel Borja,  Daniel M. Dauer,  Michael Elliott, and Charles A. Simenstad

              
We characterized stable isotope mixing along a river-Great Lake transition zone in the St. Louis River, an important fish nursery in western Lake Superior, and used it to identify food web linkages supporting young fish production. We observed a broad, spatial pattern in the carbon stable isotope ratio (δ^sup 13^C); downriver enrichment in particulate organic carbon and aquatic vegetation δ^sup 13^C, as well as pelagic, benthic and littoral invertebrate δ^sup 13^C, reflected isotope mixing along the river-lake transition zone. Fishes with similarly enriched δ^sup 13^C were used to identify benthopelagic and littoral trophic pathways. River and Lake Superior organic matter (OM) sources contributed to both pathways. Differences between the δ^sup 13^C in fishes and invertebrate prey revealed that fish production was supported at multiple spatial scales. The result was that the food web specific to any location along the transition zone incorporated multiple OM sources from across the watershed.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Monitoring trace metals in different tissues of Cyprinus carpio from the Indus River in Pakistan
AN  - 756901898; 20033282
AB  - This replicated 4×2 factorial study investigated the bioaccumulation of selected metals (Mn, Pb, Zn, Hg and Cr) in four tissues (gills, liver, muscle and skin) of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) domiciled in two sites (upstream and downstream) of Indus River in Mianwali district of Pakistan. The data were statistically compared for the main effects of the site and fish organs and their interaction on the bioaccumulation pattern of these metals in fish organs at P<0.05. It appeared that the fish sampled from downstream had higher trace metals than the fish from upstream. Significant differences between fish organs were observed for these trace metals (P<0.001). The fish showed higher bioaccumulation of vital metals like Zn and lower bioaccumulation for the toxic metals like Pb. The gills had the highest metal load followed by liver, skin and muscles. High concentrations of Mn, Hg and Cr were observed in different fish organs as compared to the WHO and Federal Environmental Protection Agency standards for food fish. However, the mean concentration of Pb and Zn were under the permissible limits of food fish. It implies that higher levels of Mn, Hg and Cr in fish muscles would have detrimental effects on the health of fish consumers such as pregnant women, children and elderly people of this study area.

T1  - A phylogenetic and morphologic context for the radiation of an endemic fauna in a long-lived lake: Corbulidae (Bivalvia; Myoida) in the Miocene Pebas Formation of western Amazonia
AN  - 758653068
AB  - The Corbulidae are one of a handful of a primarily marine bivalve clades that exhibit a remarkable radiation, marked by increased species richness and divergent morphologies, within a long-lived lake. For corbulids, this diversification occurred within the lower to middle Miocene Pebas Formation of western Amazonia. Only one taxon associated with this radiation (Anticorbula) remains extant. We conducted a series of phylogenetic analyses to characterize diversification of Corbulidae within the Pebas Formation and relate that diversification to geologically older freshwater corbulids from the Paleocene Fort Union Formation of the northern Great Plains (United States). We used these results, as well as a quantitative examination of morphospace occupation, to infer whether Pebasian corbulids represent a true species flock, and whether the lacustrine system represented by the Pebas Formation represents a cradle of, or reservoir for, freshwater corbulid diversity. We conducted two sets of phylogenetic analyses using shell morphology characters. A genus-level data set incorporated type species of freshwater corbulid genera, any Paleocene representatives of these genera, and selected brackish and marine corbulid genera. A species-level analysis added all described freshwater corbulid taxa to the genus-level matrix. Our results were highly resolved (few most-parsimonious trees), but not particularly robust (low branch support). For the genus-level matrix, we used a taxon jackknife procedure to explore the effects of taxon sampling on tree stability and topology. Jackknife results recover a subclade of freshwater taxa (including both Anticorbula and Pachydon species and the Paleocene Ostomya sp.) in 92.4% of trees, although placement of this subclade across the ingroup varies, as do the topologic positions of other freshwater species. Freshwater and marine corbulids also are morphologically distinct from each other, a factor that likely reduced the robustness of our phylogenetic results. By combining these results with paleoecologic, stratigraphic, and morphologic data, we infer that freshwater corbulids arose once within the family, prior to the Cenozoic, with three distinct freshwater lineages present at their first appearance in the late Paleocene of North America. Within the Miocene Pebas system of South America, we reconstruct supralimital morphologic evolution within three lineages as freshwater taxa became variously adapted to the fluid, dysoxic muds characterizing lake-bottom facies representative of the Pebas lacustrine system. In addition, corbulids apparently successfully coped with high predation pressures from co-occurring shellcrushing predators. Finally, we consider that freshwater Corbulidae were primarily fluvial taxa throughout their geologic history, with a relatively ephemeral radiation within the Pebasian lake system, thus making the Pebasian system a cradle of diversity for several corbulid lineages.

T1  - Long-term zooplankton dynamics in the Rybinsk Reservoir (1956-2005)
AN  - 755586704
AB  - Materials of half-century observations of zooplankton in the Rybinsk Reservoir were used to establish reversible variations in its structure, abundance, and biomass and irreversible variations in the characteristics (trends). Variations with periods of 10 and 20 years have the largest effect on the community dynamics. Regression models are presented describing the dependence of zooplankton biomass averaged over May-October on its values in summer months and on the concentrations of chlorophyll a and phytoplankton and hydrothermal characteristics of the water body. Changes in zooplankton community under the effect of eutrophication and de-eutrophication of reservoir ecosystem are discussed.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Mercury accumulation in caged Corbicula: rate of uptake and seasonal variation
AN  - 744017519; 19680755
AB  - The uptake and seasonal fluctuations of total mercury were followed in caged and uncaged Asiatic clams, Corbicula fluminea, over a 1-year period in South River, Virginia. Mercury was rapidly accumulated in clams transplanted from a nominally uncontaminated site into cages on the contaminated South River, reaching 0.99 μg g^sup -1^ dry mass within the first month. Resident clams moved to cages had higher mercury contents after the first month (2.04 μg g^sup -1^ dry mass) and at all subsequent times in the study. Large monthly fluctuations in mercury were noted for both resident caged and transplant caged clams with a notable peak occurring in early spring (4.31 μg g^sup -1^ dry mass in resident caged clams). Tissue mass of caged clams steadily increased through the winter and early spring. Adjustment of mercury concentrations for tissue mass changes indicated that the changes in mercury contents were primarily due to uptake/release rather than changes in tissue mass (concentration/dilution). The present study demonstrates the utility of using caged Corbicula as mercury biomonitors and illustrates the importance of accounting for large, short-term changes of mercury content in Corbicula when designing long-term biomonitoring studies.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Association Between Environmental Microbiota and Indigenous Bacteria Found in Hemolymph, Extrapallial Fluid and Mucus of Anodonta cygnea (Linnaeus, 1758)
AN  - 753858799; 20349058
AB  - Bivalves filter and accumulate large numbers of microorganisms present in the harvesting water. A complete understanding of the balance between Anodonta cygnea and the microbiota present in their surrounding environment remains incomplete. Therefore, the aim of this study was to quantify and identify the indigenous bacteria in the biological fluids of A. cygnea collected from Mira Lagoon in northern Portugal. The results showed Vibrio metschnikovii and Aeromonas sobria as the dominant groups. The median for total bacteria from mucus was 3.1×10^sup 3^CFU g^sup -1^, whereas the range in means from fluids was 1.5×10^sup 2^ to 6.5×10^sup 2^CFU ml^sup -1^. During the experimental work, Escherichia coli and enterococci were not detected in healthy A. cygnea. However, the periodic detection of E. coli and enterococci in Mira lagoon revealed its presence in the water. Our observations suggest that A. cygnea has the ability to filter and eliminate E. coli, present in the surrounding environment, through an active phagocytic process conducted by hemolymph circulating cells, the hemocytes.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Identifying major pesticides affecting bivalve species exposed to agricultural pollution using multi-biomarker and multivariate methods
AN  - 617395449; 20369380
AB  - The aim of this investigation was to identify major pesticides that may cause detrimental effects in bivalve species affected by agricultural pollution. Investigations were carried out using freshwater clams (Corbicula fluminea) transplanted in the main drainage channels that collect the effluents coming from agriculture fields in the Ebro Delta (NE Spain) during the main growing season of rice (from May to August). Environmental hazards were assessed by measuring simultaneous up 46 contaminant levels and 9 biomarker responses. Measured biological responses showed marked differences across sites and months. Antioxidant and esterase enzyme responses were in most cases inhibited. Lipid peroxidation levels increased steadily from May in upstream stations to August in drainage channels. Principal Component (PCA) and Partial Least Squares to Latent Structure regression (PLS) analyses allowed the identification of endosulfan, propanil, and phenylureas as being the chemical contaminants causing the most adverse effects in the studied species.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Oil pollution increases plasma antioxidants but reduces coloration in a seabird
AN  - 613805526; 20532916
AB  - It has been suggested that condition-dependent signals may be a useful measure of environmental quality. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that oil pollution enhances oxidative stress and impairs expression of a carotenoid-based signal in a wild population of the yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis). During the courtship period, a group of gulls were fed a supplementary diet containing heavy fuel oil from the Prestige oil spill and were compared with control gulls fed a similar supplementary diet without fuel oil. Blood levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, the most toxic components of crude oils, were higher (30%) in the Prestige oil-fed gulls than in the control gulls. Plasma concentrations of vitamin E and carotenoids were also significantly higher in the Prestige oil-fed gulls (31 and 27%, respectively). Although, the plasma levels of lipid peroxidation markers were higher (13%) in gulls fed with Prestige oil than in the control gulls, these differences were not significant, possibly because of the small number of gulls analyzed. The red bill spot was significantly smaller (16%) in the oil-fed gulls than in the control individuals. This study provides the first experimental evidence that a carotenoid-based signal in a free-living seabird is affected by exposure to oil pollution and is hence indicative of environmental quality. Since the yellow-legged gull belongs to a complex of species widely distributed throughout the northern hemisphere, the method described may constitute a useful tool for evaluating sub-lethal effects of oil spills in seabirds.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Potential Effects of an Invasive Nitrogen-Fixing Tree on a Hawaiian Stream Food Web1
AN  - 503208182
AB  - Falcataria moluccana (albizia) is an exotic nitrogen (N)-fixing tree currently invading riparian forests in Hawai'i, U.S.A. This study examined how this invasion is impacting stream ecosystems by using naturally occurring stable isotopes of carbon (C) and N to compare food web structure between a noninvaded and an albizia-invaded stream reach on the island of Hawai'i. Isotopic signatures of particulate organic matter (POM), macroalgae, invertebrates, and fishes were collected and compared between the two stream reaches. Stable C isotopic signatures of organic matter sources (POM and macroalgae) and consumers (amphipods, caddisflies, crayfish, and fishes) from the invaded site were depleted in ^sup 13^C compared with the noninvaded site. In contrast, all samples from the invaded site were enriched in ^sup 15^N compared with the noninvaded site. Results from IsoSource and two-source mixing models suggested that albizia was a major contributor to diets of lower-level consumers within the invaded site, displacing POM and macroalgae as their major food sources. Albizia was also an indirect C and N source for higher-level consumers within the invaded site because albizia was the major dietary constituent of their prey. In addition, ^sup 15^N enrichment of the macroalgae at the invaded site suggests that albizia may be an important N source to benthic primary producers and could be further altering the food web from bottom up. Our study provides some of the first evidence that invasive riparian N-fixing trees can potentially alter the structure of stream food webs. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - An evaluation of different methods for transportation of the freshwater mussel Lamellidens corrianus (Lea 1834)
AN  - 871221365
AB  - The freshwater mussel Lamellidens corrianus (Lea 1834) is widely distributed in ponds and large bodies of perennial waters in the Indian subcontinent. It is one of the important species for producing freshwater pearls in India. As the freshwater pearl aquaculture activity may expand on wide scale in future, it may require collecting L. corrianus from the distant places and transport to pearl producing centres. Hence, in order to develop suitable method for transportation of L. corrianus to obtain high survival with minimum physiological stress, the present study was conducted. L. corrianus were transported by two different methods i.e. in air (in wet gunny bags) and in water (in plastic polyethylene bags containing water) to find out the best method for transportation. Glucose was chosen as the stress factor as the heightened circulating glucose levels may reflect the bivalve's ability to respond to weather extremes, handling stress or any recent environmental stress perceived to require extra energy. Experiments were conducted both under field as well as laboratory conditions, during the start of winter season, where regional temperature falls to 4-5°C below the average. Under the field experiment, L. corrianus (total length = 8.26 ± 0.34 cm; wet weight = 52.62 ± 3.18 g) were transported by road from Khopoli (Dist. Raigad, Maharashtra State) to Ratnagiri (Dist. Ratnagiri, Maharashtra State) for 12 h in air and water (reservoir water temperature = 26.4°C). Under laboratory conditions, simulating air transportation was done in wet gunny bags (42.5 cm × 62.5 cm), each bag containing 50 mussels (total length = 8.34 ± 0.46 cm; wet weight = 53.2 ± 3.24 g). Simulating water transportation was carried out using plastic polyethylene bags (45 cm × 60 cm), with 50 mussels in five litres of water (water temperature = 26.5°C). At periodical intervals, glucose concentrations from mantle, gill and posterior adductor muscle were estimated. Under both field and laboratory conditions, glucose levels were significantly higher in mantle, gill and posterior adductor muscle tissue of L. corrianus transported in air when compared to that of water-transported mussels. Results showed that air transportation was comparatively more stressful than water transportation. However, cent per cent survival was obtained in the both methods just after transportation and after 7 days of transportation. Considering the absence of mortality in both methods, it can be concluded that the choice of the mussel transportation method is more economical dependent than biological dependent.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Similarities and differences of metal distributions in the tissues of molluscs by using multivariate analyses
AN  - 221979159; 19452255
AB  - Multivariate analysis including correlation, multiple stepwise linear regression, and cluster analyses were applied to investigate the heavy metal concentrations (Cd, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb, and Zn) in the different parts of bivalves and gastropods. It was also aimed to distinguish statistically the differences between the marine bivalves and the gastropods with regards to the accumulation of heavy metals in the different tissues. The different parts of four species of bivalves and four species of gastropods were obtained and analyzed for heavy metals. The multivariate analyses were then applied on the data. From the multivariate analyses conducted, there were correlations found between the soft tissues of bivalves and gastropods, but none was found between the shells and the soft tissues of most of the molluscs (except for Cerithidea obtusa and Puglina cochlidium). The significant correlations (P < 0.05) found between the soft tissues were further complemented by the multiple stepwise linear regressions where heavy metals in the total soft tissues were influenced by the accumulation in the different types of soft tissues. The present study found that the distributions of heavy metals in the different parts of molluscs were related to their feeding habits and living habitats. The statistical approaches proposed in this study are recommended for use in biomonitoring studies, since multivariate analyses can reduce the cost and time involved in identifying an effective tissue to monitor the heavy metal(s) bioavailability and contamination in tropical coastal waters.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Effect of fasting on hypogean (Niphargus stygius) and epigean (Gammarus fossarum) amphipods: a laboratory study
AN  - 217964956
AB  - Two amphipods, the hypogean Niphargus stygius and epigean Gammarus fossarum, were analyzed for fatty acid (FA) composition, electron transport system (ETS) activity and respiration (R) during a laboratory fasting experiment. In agreement with ETS and R measurements (and the ETS/R ratio), the hypogean N. stygius utilized FA more slowly than the epigean G. fossarum. Inter-specific differences in the utilization of certain FA during fasting were also revealed. While N. stygius tended to preserve all of its FA during the experimental fasting period, G. fossarum showed a tendency to utilize MUFA (monounsaturated FA) and SAFA (saturated FA) and preferentially retain PUFA (polyunsaturated FA). The significant correlations between ETS activity and composition of specific FA during fasting can be linked to R. During the fasting, both ETS activity and respiration rate of G. fossarum decreased, however, ETS/R ratio increased. In contrast, N. stygius did not show significant changes in these parameters. This is the first report, which connects ETS activity with changes in concentrations of specific FA during fasting. Such evolutionary adaptations of hypogean species enables them to better survive chronically low and/or discontinuous food supplies compared to epigean species, which live in environments where food shortages are much less frequent.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Linking calcification by exotic snails to stream inorganic carbon cycling
AN  - 199302751; 20058027
AB  - Biotic calcification is rarely considered in freshwater C budgets, despite calculations suggesting that calcifying animals can alter inorganic C cycling. Most studies that have quantified biocalcification in aquatic ecosystems have not directly linked CO^sub 2^ fluxes from biocalcification with whole-ecosystem rates of inorganic C cycling. The freshwater snail, Melanoides tuberculata, has achieved a high abundance and 37.4 g biomass m^sup -2^ after invading Kelly Warm Springs in Grand Teton National Park. This high biomass suggests that introduced populations of Melanoides may alter ecosystem processes. We measured Melanoides growth rates and biomass to calculate the production of biomass, shell mass, and CO^sub 2^. We compared Melanoides biomass and inorganic C production with ecosystem C pools and fluxes, as well as with published rates of CO^sub 2^ production by other calcifying organisms. Melanoides calcification in Kelly Warm Springs produced 12.1 mmol CO^sub 2^ m^sup -2^ day^sup -1^ during summer months. We measured high rates of gross primary productivity and respiration in Kelly Warm Springs (-378 and 533 mmol CO^sub 2^ m^sup -2^ day^sup -1^, respectively); CO^sub 2^ produced from biocalcification increased net CO^sub 2^ production in Kelly Warm Springs from 155 to 167 mmol CO^sub 2^ m^sup -2^ day^sup -1^. This rate of CO^sub 2^ production via biocalcification is within the published range of calcification by animals. But these CO^sub 2^ fluxes are small when compared to ecosystem C fluxes from stream metabolism. The influence of animals is relative to ecosystem processes, and should always be compared with ecosystem fluxes to quantify the importance of a specific animal in its environment.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT] Erratum DOI: 10.1007/s00442-010-1574-8

T1  - Effects of stocking density, temperature, and salinity on larval survival and growth of the red race of the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus (Selenka)
AN  - 871220337
AB  - The red race of the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus was introduced into China from Japan for large-scale seed production because of its economic value. This paper reports the effects of stocking density, temperature, and salinity on survival and growth of early larvae before and after feeding, in order to establish conditions for optimal larval growth and production. To maximize the yield per unit of space, densities of 0.5-1 larvae/ml are recommended for non-feeding larvae, while 0.1-0.2 larvae/ml are best for feeding larvae. Higher survival and growth values were obtained for both non-feeding and feeding larvae at temperature ranges from 21 to 24°C. Larvae reared at a salinity of 30[per thousand] always showed maximum growth and survival. Based on results of this study, a temperature range from 21 to 24°C and a salinity of 30 are considered optimal for early development of the red A. japonicus.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Biosorption and bioaccumulation of heavy metals by rock oyster Saccostrea cucullata in the Persian Gulf
AN  - 2623506612
AB  - Effective treatments of industrial waste streams and toxic spills containing heavy metals related with rapid removal of metal ions at high concentrations. Influences of clearance and absorption rates on two heavy metals (copper and cadmium) by saccustrea cucullata originated from mangrove ecosystem in the Northern Persian Gulf were investigated. Specimens were collected from sub-tidal band during neap tide; groups of 15 individual were placed in 1.5 L containers (2-liter volume), which were immersed in the water. After the acclimation time (i.e. the regulation of filtration activity caused by manipulation and any other sources), specific clearance and absorption performances were measured during alternation of stagnation and flow positions. Temperature, salinity and particle concentrations were maintained. The clearance rate is affected by the amount of cadmium (from 1.69 to 0.04 ml min/g/h AFDW) and copper (from 2.16 ml to 0.42 ml min/g/h AFDW). Although the clearance rate was significantly reduced, live oysters reduced the amount of cadmium and copper from 150 and 200 µg/l to 118.68 and 133.30 µg/l respectively. Oyster had the different clearance rates toward copper and cadmium when simultaneously introduced. The dead shells also had a good ability to reduce the metal condensation. According to the results it can be concluded that Sacostrea cucullata can be used as biofilters with good clearance ability.

T1  - Mumbai harbour, India: gateway for introduction of marine organisms
AN  - 222002655; 19357981
AB  - Ships have been identified as one of the important vectors in the translocation of organisms from one bioregion to another leading to bioinvasion. In this context, harbours serve as a gateway for the introduction of alien species. Surveys were carried out in the vicinity of ports of Mumbai for macrobenthic fauna, zooplankton and hard substratum community on three different occasions during 2001-2002. The study shows that 14 polychaete species are recently introduced to this area. Mytilopsis sallei, a bivalve, which is an invasive species in the Indian context continued to be present but was restricted to enclosed docks, indicating preference for embayed water bodies. The polychaete Protula tubularia was abundant in the hard substratum community and is being reported as a possible ship-mediated introduction.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Integrated assessment of water quality of the Costa da Morte (Galicia, NW Spain) by means of mussel chemical, biochemical and physiological parameters
AN  - 214682613; 20033486
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess environmental quality at some of the sites most severely affected by the Prestige oil spill off 2 years after the spillage (April and November 2004). For this purpose analyses of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and several biochemical (antioxidant enzymes catalase, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and DT-diaphorase and lipid peroxidation) and physiological [scope for growth (SFG)] biomarkers were determined on wild mussel populations (Mytilus galloprovincialis) collected at four points along the Costa da Morte and compared with those of a reference site not affected by the oil spill. Results showed that PAH contents had markedly decreased 17 months after the accident, although they were higher in April than in November, when they showed values similar to background levels reported for this area. Nevertheless, the predominance of chrysene on PAH profiles, similarly to findings obtained immediately after the spill, indicated the Prestige as their main source. In spite of the low PAH levels recorded, antioxidant activity levels (explained through the integrated antioxidant response-IAR) were higher in the Costa da Morte than at the reference site either in April and November. In April IAR seems to be related to PAH levels found 3 months after the accident (February 2003), suggesting the persistence in the environment of oxidative stress-producing components from the spill. However, evidence of oxidative stress was not reflected at physiological level by scope for growth, with only very slight differences being observed between values from the reference site and those from Costa da Morte sites. In conclusion, although 2 years after the spill PAHs bioaccumulated by mussels from the Costa da Morte had decreased to background levels, biochemical parameters showed signals of oxidative stress in mussels from this area. However, SFG reflected a good health status for the mussel populations studied and did not reveal evidence of physiological disturbance either 17 or 24 months after the Prestige spill.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Induction of anti-predator responses in the green-lipped mussel Perna viridis under hypoxia
AN  - 208060964
AB  - Hypoxia due to the over enrichment of waters by nutrients is becoming a global problem. In mussels, enhanced byssus thread production is an important adaptation to the presence of crustacean predators and to energetic hydrodynamic regimes. Thread production is an energy-consuming process, so this study used the green mussel Perna viridis (L.) to examine the response to predator exposure combined with hypoxia. Hypoxia is common in sheltered bays in Hong Kong, and the mussels were collected in one such bay, Lok Wo Sha (latitude/longitude: 22°18' N/114°10' E) in January, 2009. The predator used in the experiments was the swimming crab Thalamita danae. Oxygen concentrations used in the 48-h experiments ranged from hypoxic to normoxic (1.5 ± 0.3 mg l^sup -1^, 3.0 ± 0.3 mg l^sup -1^ and 6.0 ± 0.3 mg l^sup -1^). Fewer byssus threads which were also shorter and thinner were produced at reduced oxygen levels, no matter if the predator was present or not; the frequency the mussels shed stalks was also lower. Mussels exposed to the predator, however, have enhanced byssus thread production at all oxygen levels when compared with the control. This has highlighted the significance of anti-predator responses for the survival of individuals even under a stressful environment in which energy supply is limited by aerobic metabolism. Interactive effects between oxygen level and predator exposure were observed for the byssus thread production (frequency of shed stalks, mean byssus thread length, cumulative byssus thread volume), with values obtained at 1.5 and 3.0 mg O2 l^sup -1^ being statistically indistinguishable for the control group without predator but not for the predator group. The lack of differences in the byssus thread production at lower oxygen levels in the absence of predator may indicate the minimum amount of byssus that is required for settlement on a substrate.

T1  - Effects of nonylphenol on a soil community using microcosms
AN  - 204574859
AB  - Nonylphenol polyethoxylates (NPEOs) are a group of surfactants known to be toxic and able to mimic estrogen compounds and thus interfere with the action of an animal's endogenous hormones. NPEOs are easily biodegraded in the environment, but the last end product, nonylphenol (NP), is the most toxic and recalcitrant form and hence can have a longer half-life in the environment. Despite the fact that most NP is finally degraded, a small fraction may remain in soil for longer periods. In soils, the application of sewage sludge is the main source of NPEOs. The aim of this study is to provide data on the effects of NP on a simplified soil invertebrate community since only a few studies using single-species bioassays are available for terrestrial ecosystems in comparison with aquatic ecosystems.

              
In our study, we assessed the effect of increasing NP concentrations (0, 10, 30, 90, and 270 mg NP kg^sup -1^) in soil microcosms containing a simplified soil community consisting of natural microorganisms, a primary producer (an oat seedling of Avena sativa), several consumers (the isopod Porcellionides sexfasciatus, the enchytraeid Enchytraeus crypticus, and the collembolans Folsomia candida, Ceratophysella (Hypogastrura) denticulata, and Proisotoma minuta), and a predator species (the mite Hypoaspis aculeifer). The effects on the different taxa of the different NP concentrations were assessed over three sampling dates (28, 56, and 112 days) using the principal response curves method.

              
The soil community did not change significantly at concentrations below 90 mg NP kg^sup -1^, which was selected as the nonobserved effect concentration (NOEC). The highest concentration (270 mg NP kg^sup -1^) changed the community significantly after 28 and 56 days, but this effect disappeared after 112 days, in accordance with the known rapid biodegradation of this compound in soil.

              
Taking into account the usual NP concentrations in soils with repeated applications of sludge, the environmental risk of NP to soils seems to be limited because the derived NOEC was clearly above the usual concentrations in soil reported in the literature. However, the use of highly polluted sludges or accidental spillages, together with the possible pollution exportation by runoff to aquatic ecosystems, which are highly sensitive to NP pollution, recommend the careful monitoring of this chemical in the environment.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Environmental Forcing of Phytoplankton in a Mediterranean Estuary (Guadiana Estuary, South-western Iberia): A Decadal Study of Anthropogenic and Climatic Influences
AN  - 230023838
AB  - Phytoplankton seasonal and interannual variability in the Guadiana upper estuary was analyzed during 1996-2005, a period that encompassed a climatic controlled reduction in river flow that was superimposed on the construction of a dam. Phytoplankton seasonal patterns revealed an alternation between a persistent light limitation and episodic nutrient limitation. Phytoplankton succession, with early spring diatom blooms and summer-early fall cyanobacterial blooms, was apparently driven by changes in nutrients, water temperature, and turbulence, clearly demonstrating the role of river flow and climate variability. Light intensity in the mixed layer was a prevalent driver of phytoplankton interannual variability, and the increased turbidity caused by the Alqueva dam construction was linked to pronounced decreases in chlorophyll a concentration, particularly at the start and end of the phytoplankton growing period. Decreases in annual maximum and average abundances of diatoms, green algae, and cyanobacteria were also detected. Furthermore, chlorophyll a decreases after dam filling and a decrease in turbidity may point to a shift from light limitation towards a more nutrient-limited mode in the near future.

T1  - Comparison of fish and phantom midge influence on cladocerans diel vertical migration in a dual basin lake
AN  - 217972319
AB  - Diurnal vertical migrations (DVM) behaviour of cladocerans was investigated in two mesotrophic Irish lakes connected by a canal, characterised by interesting differences in the presence of zooplanktivorous predators. In Doon Upper, fish (mostly juvenile perch and roach) and a little-studied phantom midge Mochlonyx fuliginosus (Chaoboridae) were found, but Doon Lower was solely inhabited by fish. As the presence of diverse predators may alter spatial avoidance behaviour of zooplankton prey in different ways, the aim of this study was to determine whether and how two predator types, fish and phantom midge larvae, have changed DVM pattern of cladocerans during day and night in Doon lakes. Two sampling series of phytoplankton, zooplankton, fish, and water physical analyses were conducted on 09-10 June and 19-20 September 2007 in both lakes. In the study conducted in June, under a similar distribution of M. fuliginosus and juvenile fish in Doon Upper, a reverse migration of Daphnia                         galeata was observed as a strategy allowing them to avoid both types of predators. However, in September, when M. fuliginosus lived in a 24 h refugium below the oxycline as a response to increasing predation risk posed by YOY fish penetrated the upper strata of water during day and night, reverse migrations of D. galeata were not clear. In Doon Lower, normal migration was observed as an advantageous behavioural response against visual predators (fish), in both large and small Cladocera species: D. galeata, Diaphanosoma branchyurum and Bosmina sp. Thus, our results indicate dissimilar migration patterns of D. galeata depending on the presence of one (Doon Lower) or two predators with different predation behaviour (Doon Upper).[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Prey selection by larvae of Prochilodus lineatus (Pisces: Curimatidae): indigenous zooplankton versus veligers of the introduced bivalve Limnoperna fortunei (Bivalvia: Mitilidae)
AN  - 217961875
AB  - We studied experimentally the feeding selectivity of larvae of Prochilodus lineatus (Pisces), with particular emphasis on the role of veligers of the exotic bivalve Limnoperna fortunei. Three concentrations of veligers were offered to three developmental stages of P. lineatus. Veliger concentrations were: (1) higher than in the field ("enriched", 0.09 ind. ml^sup -1^), (2) unmodified from field conditions ("normal", 0.06 ind. ml^sup -1^), and (3) lower than in the field ("low", 0.02 ind. ml^sup -1^). Fish developmental stages were protolarvae (approx. 10 days old), mesolarvae (17 days), and metalarvae (25 days). Proportions (in terms of numbers and biomass) and selectivity values were calculated for each prey item evaluated: veligers, small cladocerans + nauplii, medium-sized cladocerans, copepodits, and large cladocerans + copepods. Protolarvae and mesolarvae consumed veligers almost exclusively (88-90%, both in numbers and in biomass) when offered prey enriched in veligers, whereas for metalarvae veligers represented only 16.0% of the food consumed. At lower veliger concentrations, only protolarvae preferred Limnoperna veligers, whereas older fishes switched gradually to crustacean plankton. We conclude that veligers are preferred by the early fish developmental stages, and we speculate that this may be because their slower swimming makes them easier to capture than planktonic crustaceans. However, as fish larvae grow larger, veligers become too small a prey for their energetic needs, and they switch to larger items like cladocerans and copepods. We anticipate that this new and abundant food resource has an important impact on the survival and growth of P. lineatus. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - River stage response to alteration of Upper Mississippi River channels, floodplains, and watersheds
AN  - 195903463
AB  - Issue Title: Upper Mississippi River Research Synthesis:  Forty Years of Ecological Research / Guest Editors: S.P. Romano & B. Ickes

              
The Upper Mississippi River System (UMRS) is a large and diverse river system that changes character along its 1,200 mile network of rivers and canals and 2.6 million acres of floodplain. It supports more than 30 million people in its watershed, a significant commercial waterway, more than a million acres of "floodplain" agriculture and about one-half million acres of river-floodplain managed for fish, wildlife, and recreation. Large-scale geomorphology and climate patterns largely determine the hydrologic characteristics of a nested hierarchy of UMRS river reaches. The human impacts above are also important drivers determining hydrologic characteristics within the hierarchy. Understanding the relationship among physical and chemical processes and ecological responses is critical to implement an adaptive management framework for UMRS ecosystem sustainability. Historic or contemporary data from 42 locations were used to examine changes in UMRS hydrology and to demonstrate the utility of a multiple reference condition analysis for river restoration. A multivariate mathematical framework was used to show how river stage hydrology can be characterized by the variability, predictability, seasonality, and rate of change. Large-scale "geomorphic reaches" have distinct hydrologic characteristics and response to development throughout the UMRS region, but within navigation pool hydrology is similar among all impounded reaches regardless of geomorphic reach. Reaches with hydrologic characteristics similar to historic reference conditions should be examined to determine whether those characteristics support desired management objectives. Water levels can be managed, within limits to support navigation and agriculture, to more closely resemble natural hydrology for the benefit of a variety of species, habitats, and ecological processes.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Nitrogen and phosphorus in the Upper Mississippi River: transport, processing, and effects on the river ecosystem
AN  - 195889966
AB  - Issue Title: Upper Mississippi River Research Synthesis:  Forty Years of Ecological Research / Guest Editors: S.P. Romano & B. Ickes

              
Existing research on nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) in the Upper Mississippi River (UMR) can be organized into the following categories: (1) Long-term changes in nutrient concentrations and export, and their causes; (2) Nutrient cycling within the river; (3) Spatial and temporal patterns of river nutrient concentrations; (4) Effects of elevated nutrient concentrations on the river; and (5) Actions to reduce river nutrient concentrations and flux. Nutrient concentration and flux in the Mississippi River have increased substantially over the last century because of changes in land use, climate, hydrology, and river management and engineering. As in other large floodplain rivers, rates of processes that cycle nitrogen and phosphorus in the UMR exhibit pronounced spatial and temporal heterogeneity because of the complex morphology of the river. This spatial variability in nutrient processing creates clear spatial patterns in nutrient concentrations. For example, nitrate concentrations generally are much lower in off-channel areas than in the main channel. The specifics of in-river nutrient cycling and the effects of high rates of nutrient input on UMR have been less studied than the factors affecting nutrient input to the river and transport to the Gulf of Mexico, and important questions concerning nutrient cycling in the UMR remain. Eutrophication and resulting changes in river productivity have only recently been investigated the UMR. These recent studies indicate that the high nutrient concentrations in the river may affect community composition of aquatic vegetation (e.g., the abundance of filamentous algae and duckweeds), dissolved oxygen concentrations in off-channel areas, and the abundance of cyanobacteria. Actions to reduce nutrient input to the river include changes in land-use practices, wetland restoration, and hydrological modifications to the river. Evidence suggests that most of the above methods can contribute to reducing nutrient concentration in, and transport by, the UMR, but the impacts of mitigation efforts will likely be only slowly realized.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - An appraisal of a biocontamination assessment method for freshwater macroinvertebrate assemblages; a practical way to measure a significant biological pressure?
AN  - 288432072
AB  - Freshwater invasive or alien species (IAS) can have a major impact on benthic macroinvertebrate assemblage structure and diversity. This has implications for accurate biological monitoring, the assessment of the ecological quality status of rivers and achievement of Water Framework Directive (WFD) objectives. Although IAS constitutes a major biological pressure to WFD objectives, current approaches to ecological status assessment tend to ignore their presence. This problem is compounded as biotic indices such as the Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP) score do not distinguish between native and IAS, when IAS tend to be more tolerant of organic pollution than the natives they replace. Biocontamination is the presence of an IAS in a system, and we tested a new method of biocontamination assessment, designed to be used alongside current routine water quality monitoring techniques, by applying it to biological monitoring data from the river monitoring programme of a small Island, The Isle of Man. Although 54% of monitoring sites exhibited no biocontamination, 19% showed low or moderate biocontamination and 27% high or severe biocontamination. Richness contamination was low (only two contaminated families being recorded), but abundance contamination was high in some sites (87% of individuals being IAS). Sites with a greater relative abundance of IAS individuals exhibited lower BMWP water quality. Within invaded sites BMWP monitoring was not responsive to changing chemical water quality, whereas within uninvaded sites it was. In invaded sites, the relative abundance of IAS increased as ammonia and BOD^sub 5^ increased. Our study shows current monitoring approaches mask the presence of AIS within assemblages, with some highly biocontaminated sites registering high BMWP biological quality. This new index represents a simple way to integrate the IAS biological pressure into established WFD monitoring programmes, to produce more comprehensive estimates of ecological quality status than are currently being realised.

T1  - Riverine habitat heterogeneity: the role of slackwaters in providing hydrologic buffers for benthic microfauna
AN  - 288425150
AB  - Slackwater habitats within lowland rivers support abundant biotic communities and provide these communities with a refuge from increases in discharge. These refuges allow biota to persist as discharges, vary and provide a source of colonists for slackwaters further downstream. In order to investigate the response of slackwater benthic microfaunal communities to changes in discharge, artificial slackwaters were created within the main channel of a lowland river and benthic microfaunal communities were sampled over a 60-day period. Benthic microfauna within the artificial and reference slackwaters were recorded in higher richness and abundance than in the main river channel. Within days the communities in the artificial slackwaters were similar to those in the reference slackwaters. The rapid speed of colonisation suggests that initial colonisation of slackwaters is likely to occur via active or passive dispersal of biota and that these systems and communities are resilient to changes in discharge.

T1  - The Effect of Municipal Wastewater Effluent on Nitrogen Levels in Onondaga Lake, a 36-Year Record
AN  - 216071645; 20112533
AB  - This work presents a retrospective analysis of long-term trends in loading of forms of nitrogen (N) from the Metropolitan Syracuse Wastewater Treatment Plant (Metro), N concentrations in the receiving urban lake (Onondaga Lake, New York), and related water quality status for the period from 1972 to 2007. The history of the evolution of treatment and discharge at Metro, as it affected N loading, is reviewed and forms the basis for identification of five regimes during which unifying conditions of loading and in-lake conditions prevailed. Changes in industrial waste inputs have complicated the effects of upgrades in treatment at Metro from primary (until 1978) to advanced (starting in 2004). Current N loading from Metro is approximately 35% lower than the peak levels observed in the late 1980s to late 1990s, but the areal rate to the lake remains extremely high (approximately 97 g/m^sup 2^*y), representing approximately 75% of the overall N load. Implementation of year-round nitrification treatment has resulted in transformation of the composition of the N load from Metro from ammonia (T-NH^sub 3^) to nitrate (NO^sub 3^^sup -^) dominance. High N concentrations have prevailed in the upper waters of the lake throughout the study period with averages of total N ranging from 2.6 to 4.3 mg/L for the five regimes. Total N levels and partitioning among the forms in the lake generally have tracked Metro loading conditions for the five regimes. The effects of Metro loading on seasonal in-lake patterns are demonstrated to be modified by both hydrologic inputs from tributaries and in-lake operation of biochemical processes. Resolution of these effects is supported by application of both empirical and dynamic mass balance models. Water quality problems related to high concentrations of forms of N are documented, including (1) augmentation of dissolved oxygen depletion during fall mixing from in-lake nitrification events, enabled by high T-NH^sub 3^ levels; (2) violations of ammonia toxicity limits; and (3) violations of nitrite toxicity standards. These problems were either greatly ameliorated or eliminated by Metro's most recent treatment upgrades. Prevailing conditions are considered in a management context, including (1) likelihood of exceedances of toxicity limits in the future and (2) potential role of elevated nitrate levels in preventing mobilization of methyl mercury from the lake's sediments.

T1  - No more lake balls (Aegagropila linnaei Kützing, Cladophorophyceae, Chlorophyta) in The Netherlands?
AN  - 218001680
AB  - Aegagropila linnaei, a freshwater green macroalga, had been abundant in several locations in The Netherlands before the 1960s. Both the 'lake ball' form of this alga and dense unattached mats floating over the sediment have been described from these locations. After 1967, this species has not been recorded anymore from The Netherlands. In 2007, several historical collection sites were surveyed for extant populations of A. linnaei. All habitats have changed drastically during the last 50 years and were affected severely by eutrophication. Populations of A. linnaei seem to have become extinct in all but one location (Boven Wijde, province Overijssel), where we found very small amounts of attached filaments. The attached form had not been reported previously from The Netherlands. Environmental conditions do not seem suitable anymore to maintain extensive unattached growth forms including the enigmatic lake balls, and the species must be regarded as threatened in The Netherlands and we propose to include A. linnaei in a national red list. The decline of populations elsewhere is reviewed and discussed in this paper. In addition to morphological identification of the attached filaments, partial sequences of the nuclear large subunit rDNA were generated and compared with different growth forms and habitats from several other locations outside The Netherlands. The sequences confirm the identity of the Dutch material and indicate very little divergence both between populations in different locations and between different growth forms.

T1  - Late-summer phytoplankton in western Lake Erie (Laurentian Great Lakes): bloom distributions, toxicity, and environmental influences
AN  - 217985049
AB  - Phytoplankton abundance and composition and the cyanotoxin, microcystin, were examined relative to environmental parameters in western Lake Erie during late-summer (2003-2005). Spatially explicit distributions of phytoplankton occurred on an annual basis, with the greatest chlorophyll (Chl) a concentrations occurring in waters impacted by Maumee River inflows and in Sandusky Bay. Chlorophytes, bacillariophytes, and cyanobacteria contributed the majority of phylogenetic-group Chl a basin-wide in 2003, 2004, and 2005, respectively. Water clarity, pH, and specific conductance delineated patterns of group Chl a, signifying that water mass movements and mixing were primary determinants of phytoplankton accumulations and distributions. Water temperature, irradiance, and phosphorus availability delineated patterns of cyanobacterial biovolumes, suggesting that biotic processes (most likely, resource-based competition) controlled cyanobacterial abundance and composition. Intracellular microcystin concentrations corresponded to Microcystis abundance and environmental parameters indicative of conditions coincident with biomass accumulations. It appears that environmental parameters regulate microcystin indirectly, via control of cyanobacterial abundance and distribution. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AN  - 288449822
AB  - We have detected the presence of the North American native corixid Trichocorixa verticalis verticalis (Fieber, 1851) in Doñana wetlands (SW Spain). We have collected data from different research projects done in the area during the period of 2001-2007. We have sampled 134 different sites in Doñana and we found the exotic corixid in 66 occasions. We have found two reproductive populations that might act as sources for the colonization of other waterbodies in the area. When reproduction occurred T. v. verticalis outcompeted native corixids. Its presence out of the waterbodies where we detected reproduction was in small numbers and probably due to vagrant individuals.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Biodiversity monitoring: some proposals to adequately study species' responses to climate change
AN  - 222357064
AB  - Climate change affects all levels of biology and is a major threat for biodiversity. Hence, it is fundamental to run biodiversity monitoring programs to understand the effects of climate change on the biota and to be able to adjust management and conservation accordingly. So far, however, very few existing monitoring programs allow for the detection of climate change effects, as shown by a survey undertaken by the European project EuMon. Despite this shortcoming, several methods exist which allow to make inferences from existing data by integrating data across different monitoring programs: correlative analyses, meta-analyses and models. In addition, experiments are thought to be useful tools to understand the effects of climate change on plants and animals. Here, we evaluate the utility of these four main approaches. All these methods allow to evaluate long term effects of climate change and make predictions of species' future development, but they are arguable. We list and compare their benefits and inconveniences, which can lead to uncertainties in the extrapolation of species responses to global climate change. Individual characteristics and population parameters have to be more frequently monitored. The potential evolution of a species should be also modelled, to extrapolate results across spatial and temporal scales as well as to analyse the combined effects of different climatic and biotic factors, including intra but also interspecific relationships. We conclude that a combination of methodologies would be the most promising tool for the assessment of biological responses to climate change, and we provide some thoughts about how to do so. Particularly, we encourage long-term studies along natural gradients (altitudinal or latitudinal) on the same species/habitats to be able to extrapolate to large geographic scales, and to have more complete data sets, necessary to understand the mechanisms of responses. Such data may provide a more accurate base for simulations across spatial and temporal scales, especially if they are publicly available in a common database. These recommendations could allow the adaptation of species management and the development of conservation tools to climate change which threatens species.  [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - An alternative method for the determination of estrogens in surface water and wastewater treatment plant effluent using pre-column trimethylsilyl derivatization and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry
AN  - 222018477; 18937040
AB  - A procedure using pre-column trimethylsilyl derivatization and gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry (GC/MS) was developed and applied in determining trace estrogens in complex matrix. Main conditions were optimized, including pH value, salinity of water sample, elution reagents, clean procedure, derivative solvent and temperature. The optimized method was used to determine steroid estrogens in surface water and effluents of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Low detection limits of 0.01, 0.03, 0.03, 0.07, 0.09 and 0.13 ng/l for DES, E1, E2, EE2, E3 and EV, respectively were obtained under optimism condition. No apparent interferences appeared in chromatography in comparison with ultrapure water blank. Mean recovery ranged from 72.6% to 111.0% with relative standard deviation of 1.1-4.6% for spiked surface water, and from 66.6% to 121.1% with relative standard deviation of 1.5-4.7% for spiked effluent of WWTP. The results suggested that the optimized method provides a robust solution for the determination of trace steroid estrogens in complex matrix. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Replacement of a native freshwater macroinvertebrate species by an invader: implications for biological water quality monitoring
AN  - 195895530
AB  - The rate of freshwater invasions may be increasing, and macroinvertebrate invaders can have significant impacts on native macroinvertebrate assemblage structure through biotic interactions. More pollution-tolerant invaders can often replace native species. We examined implications of a species replacement for accurate biological monitoring of river systems using biotic indices. Our study uses Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man as examples of countries that possess river networks with many riverine macroinvertebrate assemblages subject to invasion. The introduced amphipod crustacean Gammarus pulex has replaced the native species G. duebeni celticus in many rivers in N. Ireland and the Isle of Man. Extensive seasonal data sets (119 sites) from three river networks, Lough Neagh and the Lagan in N. Ireland, and island-wide in the Isle of Man, were used to investigate the assumed equivalence of the native and invader in biotic indices concerned with the water quality monitoring system. Based on the derivation of the Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP) score, the Average Score Per Taxon (ASPT), as an example of a commonly used biotic index of water quality, we found index scores were lower in G. pulex sites compared to G. d. celticus-only sites. This indicated that assemblages were dominated by taxa more tolerant of organic pollution in the invader sites and more sensitive in the native sites. Inclusion of the invader in generation of the ASPT index, overinflated the ASPT values obtained compared to those with the native's inclusion. This questions the accuracy of the ASPT and similar indices in rivers where the invader had replaced the native. We argue that with invasion pressures increasing, the validity of water quality indices such as the BMWP/ASPT needs to be re-examined in catchments where invaders have replaced natives. Indices such as the BMWP/ASPT are based on family level taxa and are inevitably coarse in their resolution given the wide range of water qualities tolerated by different genera within families. We argue that this resolution is even more compromised by the presence of very pollution-tolerant invaders, who may have replaced natives in disturbed or degraded river systems. The whole structure of water quality indices such as the BMWP/ASPT may need revising to take into account the presence of invasive species within monitored assemblages. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Effects of food quality on tissue-specific isotope ratios in the mussel Perna perna
AN  - 195895357
AB  - Investigations into trophic ecology and aquatic food web resolution are increasingly accomplished through stable isotope analysis. The incorporation of dietary and metabolic changes over time results in variations in isotope signatures and turnover rates of producers and consumers at tissue, individual, population and species levels. Consequently, the elucidation of trophic relationships in aquatic systems depends on establishing standard isotope values and tissue turnover rates for the level in question. This study investigated the effect of diet and food quality on isotopic signatures of four mussel tissues: adductor muscle, gonad, gill and mantle tissue from the brown mussel Perna perna. In the laboratory, mussels were fed one of the two isotopically distinct diets for 3 months. Although not all results were significant, overall δ13C ratios in adductor, mantle and gill tissues gradually approached food source signatures in both diets. PERMANOVA analyses revealed significant changes over time in tissue δ13C (mantle and gill) with both diets and in δ15N (all tissues) and C:N ratios (mantle and gill) for one diet only. The percentage of replaced carbon isotopes were calculated for the 3 month period and differed among tissues and between diets. The tissue with the highest and lowest amount of replaced isotopes over 81 days were mantle tissue on the kelp diet (33.89%) and adductor tissue on the fish food diet (4.14%), respectively. Percentages could not be calculated for any tissue in either diet for δ15N due to the lack of significant change in tissue nitrogen. Fractionation patterns in tissues for both diets can be linked to nutritional stress, suggesting that consumer isotopic signatures are strongly dependent on food quality, which can significantly affect the degree of isotopic enrichment within a trophic level.

T1  - Effects of mooring management on submerged vegetation, sediments and macro-invertebrates in Lake Constance, Germany
AN  - 214145588
AB  - Mooring areas are a common form of berthing in many of Germany's inland waters for the growing number of sporting boats. A circular swinging zone around the anchor zone is formed, in which the submerged macrophyte vegetation is destroyed to a large extent, and the sediment surface is eroded. We investigated the effects of two types of buoy (conventional and so-called hook-buoys) in comparison with undisturbed reference sites nearby. The aim of the study was to identify possible harmful consequences of mooring sites to lake littoral habitats in Lake Constance-Untersee, and to provide information to managers to aid them in the formulation of mooring management plans with the least ecological impact. The study focused on submerged vegetation, surface sediments and macro-invertebrate colonisation. In the swinging circle of conventional buoys (87 m2) we observed a significant sediment matter erosion of 0.9 tonnes and a reduction of organic matter amount by 4.5% of the undisturbed reference. The vegetation free area increased by 122%, and the phytomass (mainly Chara div. spp.) was reduced by 14.6% per berth. The psammophilous macro-invertebrate numbers were not significantly affected (-3%) in contrast to the phytophilous taxa which were reduced by 12.7% per berth. The mayfly larvae were the most negatively affected taxon. Oligochaetes profited from the clearing of the sediment surface in the swinging circles. The ecological effects of the hook-buoys were more minor, mainly due to the smaller swinging circle (6 m2). We concluded that the detrimental effects of mooring can be significantly reduced by mooring systems, e. g. the hook-buoy system as it was used in this study, which reduce the area disturbed and cleared by the anchor chain. We argue that these results can be generalised to mooring areas with soft bottom and dense macrophyte vegetation in Lake Constance and other large lakes. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - KEEPING AN EYE ON BALLAST WATER
AN  - 213398070
AB  - The Coast Guard's current ballast water treatment regulations have required that vessels intending to discharge ballast in U.S. waters conduct mid-ocean ballast water exchanges as the means for preventing the introduction of nonindigenous invasive species. The effectiveness of these ballast water exchanges has been variable, and has demonstrated that these exchange procedures are not a suitable method for protecting U.S. waters.

T1  - Life in the sublittoral zone of long-lived Lake Pannon: paleontological analysis of the Upper Miocene Szák Formation, Hungary
AN  - 206599805
AB  - Life and depositional environments in the sublittoral zone of Lake Pannon, a large, brackish Paratethyan lake from the Late Miocene, were reconstructed from fossils and facies of the Szák Formation. This formation is exposed in several, roughly coeval (9.4-8.9 Ma) outcrops, located along strike of the paleo-shelf-break in northwestern Hungary. The silty argillaceous marl of the formation was deposited below storm wave base, at 20-30 to 80-90 m water depth. The abundance of benthic organisms indicates that the bottom water was usually well oxygenated. Interstitial dysoxia, however, may have occurred immediately below the sediment-water interface, as evidenced by occasional preservation of trace fossils such as Diplocraterion. The fauna comprised endemic mollusks, including brackish cockles of the subfamily Lymnocardiinae, dreissenid mussels (Congeria), and highly adapted, uniquely large-sized deep-water pulmonate snails (planorbids and lymnaeids). Ostracods were dominated by endemic species and, in some cases, endemic genera of candonids, leptocytherids, cypridids, and loxoconchids. Fish remnants include a sciaenid otolith and the oldest skeletal occurrence of Perca in Europe. The phytoplankton comprised exclusively endemic coccolithophorids, mostly endemic dinoflagellates (prevailingly Spiniferites), and cosmopolitan green algae. The Late Miocene fauna and flora of Lake Pannon were in many ways similar to the modern Caspian biota, and in particular cases can be regarded as its precursor.  (PUBLICATION ABSTRACT)

T1  - Frequent Consumption and Rapid Digestion of Prey by the Lake Erie Watersnake with Implications for an Invasive Prey Species
AN  - 207181926
AB  - Studies of interactions between invasive and native species often focus on impacts on natives. We report potential impacts of a native predator, the Lake Erie Watersnake (Nerodia sipdeon insularum) on an invasive fish, the Round Goby (Apollonia melanostomus). Round Gobies have increased exponentially in the Great Lakes and now constitute >90% of prey consumed by Lake Erie Watersnakes. We investigated the effects this shift may have on round goby populations by estimating total prey consumption by Lake Erie Watersnakes. Digestive rate trials and maximum voluntary prey consumption trials indicate that gastric digestion is rapid (digestion was 90% complete after just 16.4 hours at 30°C and 20.1 hours at 25°C) and voluntary prey consumption is high (from 30.0% of adult female body mass to 117% of neonate body mass in five days). Based on palpation of wild-caught snakes, prey were detected more frequently in adult females than adult males, but no such difference was observed in subadults. The proportion of snakes containing prey varied over time with season-long averages of 11.6% for adult females, 6.9% for adult males, and 22.4% for subadults. Systematic surveys by boat indicate that nearly 90% of foraging occurs <150 m from shore. Projected annual consumption, based on gastric digestion rate, maximum voluntary prey consumption, feeding frequency of free-ranging snakes, and published energetic data and a population size of 12,000 adult watersnakes, ranges from 200,000-3,300,000 Round Gobies (4,455-56,178 kg) per year. Although impressive, this rate of prey consumption is unlikely to have more than local effects on Round Goby populations. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Comparison between the mercury contamination in populations of Unio pictorum mancus (Mollusca, Bivalvia) from two lakes of different trophic state: the oligo-mesotrophic Lake Maggiore and the eutrophic Lake Candia
AN  - 2417753000
AB  - This research was designed to evaluate the influence of mussel (Unio pictorum mancus) size on mercury concentration in mussel soft tissues. It also evaluated the relationships between calcium, mercury and selenium in the mussel tissues. The mussel populations from the deep, meso-oligotrophic Lake Maggiore and the shallow, eutrophic Lake Candia were analyzed. The mean concentration of mercury in the tissues was 0.075 mg kg-1 in Lake Maggiore mussels and 0.033 mg kg-1 in Lake Candia mussels. The local mercury content in the mussel biomass per surface unit was about eleven-fold higher in Lake Maggiore (5.99 μg Hg m-2) than in Lake Candia (0.55 μg Hg m-2). This wide difference was due firstly to the larger population density (46.86 vs 6.93 ind m-2) and secondly to the higher individual content (0.128 vs 0.079 μg Hg ind-1) in Lake Maggiore than in Lake Candia. These differences in population density and individual mercury content are the result of both biological and environmental characteristics. Lake trophy and water renewal affect population density and individual growth rate, and ultimately determine their impact on biogeochemical cycles by regulating the mussel standing stock. The relationships between mercury, calcium and selenium were taken into account.

T1  - Mercury distribution in the main compartments of the eutrophic Lake Candia (Northern Italy)
AN  - 2417752061
AB  - Total mercury (T-Hg) and organic mercury (mainly methylmercury, MeHg) concentrations in the most important compartments (water, sediment, macrophytes, zooplankton, mussels and fish) of the shallow and eutrophic Lake Candia (Turin, Northern Italy) were measured. The decreasing sequence of the T-Hg concentrations is as follows: cat-fish (143 μg kg-1 d.w.), zooplankton (77 μg kg-1 d.w.), Unio pictorum mancus (37.9 μg kg-1 d.w.), macrophytes (28.9 μg kg-1 d.w.). The content of mercury in mussel tissues increased with the size of the animal, but the relationship between Hg concentration and tissue weight was negative, indicating that the rate of mercury accumulation was lower than the tissue growth rate. The amount of mercury accumulated in the mussels living in the lake sediments was estimated to be 0.54 μg m-2. The importance of mercury biomagnification is also discussed.

T1  - Clearance rates of the great scallop (Pecten maximus) and blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) at low natural seston concentrations
AN  - 208065247
AB  - Great scallop, Pecten maximus, and blue mussel, Mytilus edulis, clearance rate (CR) responses to low natural seston concentrations were investigated in the laboratory to study (1) short-term CR variations in individual bivalves exposed to a single low seston diet, and (2) seasonal variations in average CR responses of bivalve cohorts to natural environmental variations. On a short temporal scale, mean CR response of both species to 0.06 µg L^sup -1^ chlorophyll a (Chl a) and 0.23 mg L^sup -1^ suspended particulate matter (SPM) remained constant despite large intra-individual fluctuations in CR. In the seasonal study, cohorts of each species were exposed to four seston treatments consisting of ambient and diluted natural seston that ranged in mean concentration from 0.15 to 0.43 mg L^sup -1^ SPM, 0.01 to 0.88 µg L^sup -1^ Chl a, 36 to 131 µg L^sup -1^ particulate organic carbon and 0.019 to 0.330 mm^sup 3^ L^sup -1^ particle volume. Although food abundance in all treatments was low, the nutritional quality of the seston was relatively high (e.g., mean particulate organic content ranged from 68 to 75%). Under these low seston conditions, a high percentage of P. maximus (81-98%) and M. edulis (67-97%) actively cleared particles at mean rates between 9 and 12 and between 4 and 6 L g^sup -1^ h^sup -1^, respectively. For both species, minimum mean CR values were obtained for animals exposed to the lowest seston concentrations. Within treatments, P. maximus showed a greater degree of seasonality in CR than M. edulis, which fed at a relatively constant rate despite seasonal changes in food and temperature. P. maximus showed a non-linear CR response to increasing Chl a levels, with rates increasing to a maximum at approximately 0.4 µg L^sup -1^ Chl a and then decreasing as food quantity continued to increase. Mean CR of M. edulis also peaked at a similar concentration, but remained high and stable as the food supply continued to increase and as temperatures varied between 4.6 and 19.6°C. The results show that P. maximus and M. edulis from a low seston environment, do not stop suspension-feeding at very low seston quantities; a result that contradicts previous conclusions on the suspension-feeding behavior of bivalve mollusks and which is pertinent to interpreting the biogeographic distribution of bivalve mollusks and site suitability for aquaculture.

T1  - Effects of nutrient enrichment on C and N stable isotope ratios of invertebrates, fish and their food resources in boreal streams
AN  - 89167298
AB  - Carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes are frequently used to study energy sources and food web structure in ecosystems, and more recently, to study the effects of anthropogenic stress on aquatic ecosystems. We investigated the effect of nutrient enrichment on δ13C and δ15N in fine (FPOM), coarse (CPOM) particulate organic matter, periphyton, invertebrates and fish in nine boreal streams in south-central Sweden. In addition, we analysed the diet of benthic consumers using stable isotope data. Increases in δ15N of periphyton (R                         2 = 0.88), CPOM (0.78), invertebrates (0.92) and fish (0.89) were related to nutrient enrichment. In contrast, δ13C signatures did not change along the nutrient gradient. Our results show that δ15N has potential as a sensitive indicator of nutrient enrichment in boreal streams. Carbon and nitrogen isotopes failed to elucidate putative diets of selected aquatic consumers. Indeed, comparison of low- and high-impact sites showed that δ13C of many consumers were found outside the ranges of basal resource δ13C. Moreover, ranges of basal resource δ13C and δ15N overlapped at both low and high sites, making discrimination between the importance of allochthonous and autochthonous production difficult. Our findings show that a fractionation rate of 3.4[per thousand] is not always be appropriate to assess trophic interactions, suggesting that more studies are needed on fractionation rates along gradients of impairment.

T1  - A MESOCOSM ANALYTICAL STUDY ON THE ECOLOGICAL INTERACTIONS OF CERTAIN BENTHOS IN RESPONSE TO THE BIODEPOSITION AND BIOTURBATION ACTIVITIES OF THE FRESHWATER MUSSEL LAMELLIDENS MARGINALIS (LAMARCK)
AN  - 885301916
AB  - The biotic influences of the biodeposition and bioturbation activities of the freshwater mussel Lamellidens marginalis (Lamarck) on the ecological interactions between certain co-existing benthic invertebrates leading to variations in their population densities were studied through a lake mesocosm experiment. The benthic organisms whose densities were monitored include nematodes, oligochaetes, chironomids, small snails and sediment dwelling colony-forming bacteria. Five exclusion (without mussels) and five experimental (with mussels) mesocosms were maintained up to 60 days (d). Even though there were no significant variations in the population densities of the organisms in the exclusion mesocosms, those of the experimental mesocosms showed significant variations. However, the patterns of variations of the population densities were different for the various organisms studied. The study clearly indicated the influences exerted by L. marginalis on the population richness of the co-existing benthic organisms. The study also revealed the probable trophic interactions between the various organisms studied. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Locomotion versus spawning: escape responses during and after spawning in the scallop Argopecten purpuratus
AN  - 208066073
AB  - The energetic cost of spawning and the endogenous factors that modulate spawning could modify escape response performance, leading to a conflict between the requirements of two fundamental components of fitness: reproduction and survival. We examined whether spawning changed force production during escape responses by the functionally hermaphroditic scallop, Argopecten purpuratus, and whether the response of smooth (tonic) and striated (phasic) muscles differed. Force production during escape responses by mature scallops was compared before induction of spawning, during spawning and after completion of spawning. Maximum tonic force and the area under the force curve (total force recorded) were diminished during gamete release, whereas phasic force production (maximum and mean force) increased after spawning was completed. The number and frequency of phasic contractions did not change during the spawning process, suggesting that spawning did not limit fuel availability for phasic contractions. The decrease in tonic force during spawning and the increased phasic force production after spawning may reflect changes in monoamine levels during gamete release. Whereas the spawning process modified force production during escape responses, the changes would, if anything, enhance escape performance during an initial encounter between a scallop and a predatory sea star.

AB  - Spatially lumped models may fail to take into account the effects of spatial heterogeneity and local interactions. These properties sometimes are crucial to the dynamics and evolutions of ecosystems. This paper started from the fundamental aspects of CA and focused on the development and application of the approach to ecological and ecohydraulics modelling. Application cases include modelling of prey-predator dynamics by stochastic CA and simulation of riparian vegetation successions in a regulated river by rule-based CA. The results indicated that spatially explicit paradigms such as cellular automata (CA) have a strong capability to bridge the local processes and global patterns.

T1  - Zooplankton seasonal dynamics in a recently filled mine pit lake: the effect of non-indigenous Daphnia establishment
AN  - 217975142
AB  - We examined the temporal and vertical dynamics of zooplankton in Weavers Lake, New Zealand, between October 2004 and October 2005, at a time when it was colonised by a non-indigenous Daphnia species. Zooplankton community composition changed during the study from one of rotifer dominance (e.g. Asplanchna, Polyarthra, Brachionus and Keratella species) to cladoceran (Daphnia                         dentifera) dominance. Temporal changes in zooplankton community composition were strongly associated with a gradual increase in lake water clarity, and were attributable to the highly efficient filter feeding of D. dentifera. The corresponding reduction in rotifer densities may have resulted from the superior competitive abilities of the newly established Daphnia. As Daphnia were rare inhabitants of New Zealand lakes before 1990, the arrival and rapid spread of the non-indigenous D. dentifera has lead to widespread changes in both water clarity and zooplankton community composition. An apparent lack of mixing in the lake was facilitated by the lake's extremely small surface area:depth ratio. However, we conclude that physical features of the lake had minimal influence on water clarity relative to the invasion of D. dentifera. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Arginine metabolism of the Antarctic Bivalve Laternula elliptica (King & Broderip, 1831): an ecophysiological approach
AN  - 210829977
AB  - The potential aerobic ATP-generating pathway and the argininolytic capacity of the Antarctic bivalve Laternula elliptica in its main tissues were measured by the specific activity of the enzymes malate dehydrogenase (MDH), citrate synthase (CS) and arginase. The kidney showed the major potential for aerobic ATP-generating pathway and argininolytic capacity. High levels of CS and MDH activities indicated that renal tissue can be involved in activities that require a lot of energy such as excretion of metabolic end products, amino acids catabolism or even gluconeogenic activities related to inter-tissue metabolism. The fact that kidneys are the main site for arginase activity is very unusual for mollusks and could be related to the living habits of L. elliptica. Genetic expression of the L. elliptica renal arginase could be controlling the levels of l-arginine and forming urea in the excretory organ, which may not have its physiological functions directly affected by the seasonal retraction of its siphons. Compared to the bivalve Dreissena polymorpha, renal arginase of L. elliptica is more resistant to inhibition by copper and cadmium. This could be related to naturally high levels of these metals in the Antarctic marine environment and its bioaccumulation in the renal tissue of L. elliptica, as a probable advantage to its environmental adaptation. Different from other Antarctic animals that feed on Krill, the arginase of L. elliptica is much more sensitive to fluoride inhibition. However, diet composition of L. elliptica would be expected to be variable site to site and its high sensitivity to fluoride inhibition may be a matter of concern in areas near ornithogenic soils subjected to ice-melting processes.

T1  - Comparison of gill surface morphology across a guild of suspension-feeding unionid bivalves
AN  - 195501757
AB  - Freshwater mussels are found in dense, multi-species aggregations where the potential for resource partitioning should be high. One means by which mussels may be partitioning resources is through feeding on different food items. We compared gill morphology in four species of co-occurring freshwater mussels. We found differences in total gill surface area, density of latero-frontal cirri and the number of cilia per cirral plate, with one species, Actinonaias ligamentina, having the largest gills with densest cirral plates relative to the other three species. These differences in feeding structures might allow these species to utilize different food resources, or could be related to other functions performed by the gills, including respiration or brood storage.

T1  - Spawning, Development, and the Duration of Larval Life in a Deep-Sea Cold-Seep Mussel
AN  - 220981689; 19366926
AB  - We describe culturing techniques and development for the cold-seep mussel "Bathymodiolus " childressi, the only deep-sea bivalve for which development has been detailed. Spawning was induced in mature mussels by injection of 2 mmol 1^sup -1^ serotonin into the anterior adductor muscle. The mean egg diameter is 69.15 ± 2.36 µm (±S.D.; n = 50) and eggs are negatively buoyant. Cleavages are spiral and at 7-8 °C occur at a rate of one per 3-9 h through hatching, with free-swimming blastulae hatching by 40 h and shells beginning to develop by day 12. When temperature was raised to 12-14 °C after hatching, larvae developed to D-shell veligers by day 8 without being fed. Egg size and larval shell morphology indicate that "B." childressi has a planktotrophic larva, but we did not observe feeding in culture. Wide distribution of this species throughout the Gulf of Mexico and amphi-Atlantic distributions of closely related congeners suggest that larvae may spend extended periods in the plankton. Duration of larval life was estimated for "B." childressi by comparing calculated settlement times to known spawning seasons. These estimates suggest variability in the larval duration, with individuals spending more than a year in the plankton. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Fine-Scale Population Genetic Structure of Zhikong Scallop (Chlamys farreri): Do Local Marine Currents Drive Geographical Differentiation?
AN  - 208946551; 18766401
AB  - Marine scallops, with extended planktonic larval stages which can potentially disperse over large distances when advected by marine currents, are expected to possess low geographical differentiation. However, the sessile lifestyle as adult tends to form discrete "sea beds" with unique population dynamics and structure. The narrow distribution of Zhikong scallop (Chlamys farreri), its long planktonic larval stage, and the extremely hydrographic complexity in its distribution range provide an interesting case to elucidate the impact of marine currents on geographical differentiation for marine bivalves at a fine geographical scale. In this study, we analyzed genetic variation at nine microsatellite DNA loci in six locations throughout the distribution of Zhikong scallop in the Northern China. Very high genetic diversity was present in all six populations. Two populations sampled from the same marine gyre had no detectable genetic differentiation (F ST=0.0013); however, the remaining four populations collected from different marine gyres or separated by strong marine currents showed low but significant genetic differentiation (FST range 0.0184-0.0602). Genetic differentiation was further analyzed using the Monmonier algorithm to identify genetic barriers and using the assignment test conducted by software GeneClass2 to ascertain population membership of individuals. The genetic barriers fitting the orientation of marine gyres/currents were clearly identified, and the individual assignment analysis indicated that 95.6% of specimens were correctly allocated to one of the six populations sampled. The results support the hypothesis that significant population structure is present in Zhikong scallop at a fine geographical scale, and marine currents can be responsible for the genetic differentiation.

T1  - Do elephants prevent other African herbivores from using waterholes in the dry season?
AN  - 222295683
AB  - In some African protected areas, concerns have arisen about the influence of locally high elephant numbers on other forms of biodiversity. In arid and semi-arid savannas, surface-water resources are scarce and agonistic interactions between elephants and other herbivores have been reported at waterholes, yet surprisingly very little is known about the impact of elephants on the use of waterholes by other herbivores. Here, we test whether when there are elephants at a waterhole, other herbivores (1) do not change their drinking behaviour; (2) spend shorter time around the water because they are disturbed by elephants' presence and consequently have to leave the waterhole area probably without having met their water requirements, or (3) spend more time around the water probably owing to an increase in vigilance activities or because the presence of elephants may signal safety from predators. Results show that all species spend longer time around water when there are elephants at the waterhole, although the difference is not large. Consequently, this study strongly suggests that elephants do not prevent other herbivores from drinking (time at waterholes is not shortened when elephants are around). Further, if the additional time spent to drink is linked to an increased vigilance, the difference is not large, and hence unlikely to affect the population dynamics of other herbivores.

T1  - Chemical contamination assessment of Gulf of Mexico oysters in response to hurricanes Katrina and Rita
AN  - 222043367; 19051046
AB  - Hurricane Katrina made landfall on August 29, 2005 and caused widespread devastation along the central Gulf Coast states. Less than a month later Hurricane Rita followed a similar track slightly west of Katrina's. A coordinated multi-agency response followed to collect water, sediment and tissue samples for a variety of chemical, biological and toxicological indicators. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Status and Trends Program (NS&T) participated in this effort by measuring chemical contamination in sediment and oyster tissue as part of the Mussel Watch Program, a long-term monitoring program to assess spatial and temporal trends in a wide range of coastal pollutants. This paper describes results for contaminants measured in oyster tissue collected between September 29 and October 10, 2005 and discusses the results in the context of Mussel Watch and its 20-year record of chemical contamination in the region and the nation. In general, levels of metals in oyster tissue were higher then pre- hurricane levels while organic contaminants were at or near record lows. No contaminant reported here exceeded the FDA action level for food safety. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Allozymes and nDNA markers show different levels of population differentiation in the mussel Mytilus edulis on British coasts
AN  - 195893309
AB  - In order to test the hypothesis that natural selection can be operating on allozymes, six nuclear DNA markers were used to study population structure in six Mytilus edulis (Linnaeus, 1758) populations around the British Isles and the results compared with previous allozyme data from the same (two sites) or very close localities (the other four sites). Allozymes and nDNA markers show significant differentiation between populations at the P < 0.01 level, with the exception of the nDNA marker PLIIa. The results also indicate significant differences (modified version of the Lewontin-Krakauer test) between the two sets of markers which are about one order of magnitude higher for nDNA than for the allozyme loci. The bootstrap analysis was carried out to correct for the possibility that this difference is a sample size artefact. These results are consistent with the operation of balancing selection on allozymes or on loci in linkage disequilibrium with them. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - ECOTOXICOGENOMICS: EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES FOR EMERGING CONTAMINANTS1
AN  - 201321677
AB  - In recent years, new classes of aquatic pollutants have received attention from environmentalists, scientists, and regulators due to their introduction into the environment, unforeseen effects associated with the pollutants, or enhanced analytical techniques presently capable of detecting them. Many of these emerging contaminants are not well studied, making predictions regarding their toxicity to aquatic organisms or environmental fate difficult. Genomic technologies, including DNA microarrays, have been employed in many areas of biology to study disease states and the interaction of chemicals and nutrients with organisms. Here, we present the potential utility of DNA microarrays to address the challenges of emerging contaminants. DNA microarrays produce gene expression profiles creating an illustration of how a pollutant is acting within an exposed organism. Homology searches and online tools such as Gene Ontology can aid in the inferring a Mode of Toxicity, which may guide toxicity testing and risk characterization. Signature gene expression profiles offer the potential to uncover novel biomarkers of exposure and predict the presence of these contaminants in aquatic organisms. The No Observed Transcriptional Effect Level may play a role in determining if a predicted environmental concentration poses a risk to a sensitive species within an ecosystem. Additionally, DNA microarrays may add a complementary approach to Toxicity Identification Evaluations and help characterize causal agents in complex effluents. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Interactions among invaders: community and ecosystem effects of multiple invasive species in an experimental aquatic system
AN  - 199344546; 18941789
AB  - With ecosystems increasingly supporting multiple invasive species, interactions among invaders could magnify or ameliorate the undesired consequences for native communities and ecosystems. We evaluated the individual and combined effects of rusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus) and Chinese mystery snails [Bellamya (=Cipangopaludina) chinensis] on native snail communities (Physa, Helisoma and Lymnaea sp.) and ecosystem attributes (algal chlorophyll a and nutrient concentrations). Both invaders are widespread in the USA and commonly co-occur within northern temperate lakes, underscoring the importance of understanding their singular and joint effects. An outdoor mesocosm experiment revealed that while the two invaders had only weakly negative effects upon one another, both negatively affected the abundance and biomass of native snails, and their combined presence drove one native species to extinction and reduced a second by >95%. Owing to its larger size and thicker shell, adult Bellamya were protected from crayfish attack relative to native species (especially Physa and Lymnaea), suggesting the co-occurrence of these invaders in nature could have elevated consequences for native communities. The per capita impacts of Orconectes (a snail predator) on native snails were substantially greater than those of Bellamya (a snail competitor). Crayfish predation also had a cascading effect by reducing native snail biomass, leading to increased periphyton growth. Bellamya, in contrast, reduced periphyton biomass, likely causing a reduction in growth by native lymnaeid snails. Bellamya also increased water column N:P ratio, possibly because of a low P excretion rate relative to native snail species. Together, these findings highlight the importance of understanding interactions among invasive species, which can have significant community- and ecosystem-level effects.

T1  - Demersal fish assemblages in the Southern California Bight based on visual surveys in deep water
AN  - 872168943
AB  - Between 1995 and 2006, manned submersible fish surveys were conducted on the sea floor throughout the Southern California Bight. A total of 401 dives (comprising 1,015 transects and 14,373 habitat patches) were made in waters between 19 and 365 m deep. All natural habitat types were included, although both soft sea floors and rocky reefs were surveyed more than any other type. A total of 717,526 fishes, representing a minimum of 137 species and 47 families, were observed. Rockfishes (genus Sebastes), with a minimum of 50 species and 647,495 individuals (90.2% of all fishes observed), dominated most of the habitats. The most abundant species, squarespot (Sebastes hopkinsi), halfbanded (Sebastes semicinctus), shortbelly (Sebastes jordani), and pygmy rockfishes (Sebastes wilsoni), are dwarf taxa that either school or aggregate. The most abundant non-rockfish species was the benthic and territorial blackeye goby (Rhinogobiops nicholsii). Both species richness and overall fish densities were highest in the shallowest sites. Most of the fishes in all habitats were small (≤20 cm TL long) and economically important species were generally uncommon. Forty-four species were found to be characteristic of the study area (occurring in at least 5% of the transects) and these species formed three faunal associations centered around depths of 62, 105, and 168 m. Based on size frequency distributions, at least 18 of the characteristic species exhibited ontogenetic movements, with young-of-the-year and older juveniles living in relatively shallow waters and larger individuals generally in deeper depths. In this study, the abundance of juvenile widow rockfish (Sebastes entomelas), and the virtual absence of adults, in southern California waters may demonstrate an ontogenetic northward movement of this species. This research implies that substantial harvesting of larger species by commercial and recreational fishers has helped alter some fish assemblages, allowing small and "weedy" species to thrive.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Zonacion vertical del macrobentos de sustratos solidos del estuario del rio Massangana, Bahia de Suape, Pernambuco, Brasil
AN  - 215433943
AB  - The estuarine area of the Massangana River (Pernambuco, Brazil) undergoes several kinds of interventions as a result of the activities of the Suape Industrial and Harbor Complex, which could affect local biotic communities. Thus, this study aimed to verify the composition of the benthic macrofauna of hard substrates regarding their vertical distribution in order to support the future biomonitoring of possible changes in this complex. The invertebrates found in an area of 519 m2 were collected and their distribution on the biogenic and abiogenic substrates was described. A total of 79 species were found, primarily in the mangroves and distributed in three intertidal zones: a Chthamaletum, which comprised the intertidal and upper shore, the balanid zone, with barnacles and oysters in the mid intertidal, and the Bostrychietum, in the lowest region. In general, this matched the Brazilian and international vertical distribution patterns for mangrove invertebrates. The presence of rocky substrate and the area's high salinity made possible the occurrence of 28 species--including the coral Siderastrea stellata--in an estuarine area. The enlarged distribution of the bivalve Isognomon alatus, the barnacle Amphibalanus reticulatus, and the bryozoans Biflustra savartii, Bowerbankia gracilis, and Conopeum reticulum on the Brazilian coast can be explained by the proximity to the Port of Suape, which allows for passive transportation on ships. The scattered distribution of the fouling organisms among the substrates and the absence of characteristic animals of this ecosystem (such as the mussels) suggest that the environment is already undergoing some stress due to the diverse human interventions occurring in this area.

T1  - Corticosterone in relation to tissue cadmium, mercury and selenium concentrations and social status of male lesser scaup (Aythya affinis)
AN  - 214674685; 18677562
AB  - Combined lesser scaup (Aythya affinis) and greater scaup (A. marila) populations have declined steadily from the 1970s. Accompanying the population decline have been two shifts in lesser scaup demographics: a decrease in the proportion of young birds and an increase in male to female ratio. In addition, there are concerns about potential effects of contaminants and trace elements. These metals may influence the stress response and corticosterone secretion. We examined impacts of cadmium, selenium and mercury on the stress response in relation to social status in male lesser scaup near Yellowknife, NWT May to June 2004 and 2005. Kidney cadmium and liver selenium and mercury ranged 0.78-93.6, 2.12-9.64, and 0.56-3.71 μg/g, dry weight, respectively. Results suggest that corticosterone release may be influenced by complex contaminant interactions in relation to body condition and body size. When cadmium was high and birds were in good body condition, there was a negative relationship between liver selenium and corticosterone (R                         2 = 0.60, n = 10, P = 0.008) but not in birds with poor body condition (R                         2 = 0.07, n = 9, P = 0.50). Unfortunately we were unable to draw any conclusions about metals and social status in relation to corticosterone or glucose and T4. This study emphasizes the complex nature of biological systems and the importance of considering interactions to characterize effects of metals. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

Ecological realism is an important yet rarely reported feature of model ecosystems. In this case study, we assess the realism of four outdoor artificial stream mesocosms (4 m2) bordering a chalk river in southern England. Comparisons of physiochemical conditions and benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages were made between the mesocosm units and the parent water body, a side arm of the River Frome. Physicochemistry of the mesocosm replicates was similar to that of the source stream, with congruent temporal variation evident between the real system and each of the models. The high realism of the mesocosms was explained by the outdoor location and close physical proximity of the array to the source stream, and the short mesocosm residence time of water sourced from the parent feeder system. Mesocosms supported a diverse array of benthic macroinvertebrates (60 families from 14 taxonomic orders), including all macroinvertebrate families in the source stream. Individual mesocosms contained a mean of 89% of source stream biota. We conclude that once-through mesocosms can be satisfactory analogues of natural systems, particularly where model and natural scales overlap. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Factors Affecting Pisidium amnicum (Müller, 1774; Bivalvia: Sphaeriidae) Distribution in the River Minho Estuary: Consequences for its Conservation
AN  - 230027510
AB  - The bivalve Pisidium amnicum (Müller 1774) is a common species in several European freshwater ecosystems. However, few Iberian watersheds are colonized by this species, and the River Minho estuary is possibly the Iberian aquatic ecosystem with the larger population. In October 2004-2007, investigations on spatial and temporal variations in P. amnicum abundance and biomass were carried out at 16 sites along the River Minho tidal freshwater wetlands. Mean abundance and biomass per site ranged from 0 to 750 ind m-2 and 0 to 7.42 g AFDW m-2, respectively. A clear decrease in the spatial distribution, abundance, and biomass was observed during the 4-year assessment. Furthermore, a stepwise multiple regression model showed that organic matter and conductivity explained 50.2% of the variation in P. amnicum abundance (R                         2=0.502, F                         [2, 15]=7.569, p=0.005). Ecological knowledge is essential to the implementation of future conservation plans for P. amnicum, and the results of this study are of paramount importance to identify habitats that should be protected in order to preserve this species and provide scientific reference that may be useful in the development of management and/or restoration plans.

T1  - Ancient Lake Ohrid: biodiversity and evolution
AN  - 195888747
AB  - Issue Title: Patterns and Processes of Speciation in Ancient Lakes: Proceedings of the Fourth Symposium on Speciation in Ancient Lakes, Berlin, Germany, September 4-8, 2006 / Guest Editors: T. Wilke, R. Väinölä & F. Riedel              Worldwide ancient lakes have been a major focal point of geological, biological, and ecological research, and key concepts in, for example, evolutionary biology are partly based on ancient lake studies. Ancient lakes can be found on most continents and climate zones with most actual or putative ancient lakes in Europe being restricted to the Balkan Region. The arguably most outstanding of them is the oligotrophic and karstic Lake Ohrid, a steep-sided graben of rift formation origin situated in the central Balkans. Here, an attempt is made to summarize current knowledge of the geological, limnological, and faunal history of Lake Ohrid. Additionally, existing data on biodiversity and endemism in Lake Ohrid are updated and evaluated, and patterns and processes of speciation are reviewed in the context of the Ohrid watershed, including its sister lake, Lake Prespa. Whereas the geological history of the Ohrid Graben is relatively well studied, there is little knowledge about the limnological and biotic history of the actual lake (e.g., the age of the extant lake or from where the lake first received its water, along with its first biota). Most workers agree on a time frame of origin for Lake Ohrid of 2-5 million years ago (Mya). However, until now, the exact limnological origin and the origin of faunal or floral elements of Lake Ohrid remain uncertain. Two largely contrasting opinions either favour the theory of de novo formation of Lake Ohrid in a dry polje with a spring or river hydrography or a palaeogeographical connection of Lake Ohrid to brackish waters on the Balkan Peninsula. Whereas neither theory can be rejected at this point, the data summarized in the current review support the de novo hypothesis. An assessment of the fauna and flora of Lake Ohrid confirms that the lake harbours an incredible endemic biodiversity. Despite the fact that some biotic groups are poorly studied or not studied at all, approximately 1,200 native species are known from the lake, including 586 animals, and at least 212 species are endemic, including 182 animals. The adjusted rate of endemicity is estimated at 36% for all taxa and 34% for Animalia. In terms of endemic biodiversity, Lake Ohrid is with these 212 known endemic species and a surface area of 358 km2 probably the most diverse lake in the world, taking surface area into account. Preliminary phylogeographical analyses of endemic Lake Ohrid taxa indicate that the vast majority of respective sister taxa occurs in the Balkans and that therefore the most recent common ancestors of Ohrid- and non-Ohrid species likely resided in the region when Lake Ohrid came into existence. These data also indicate that there is relatively little faunal exchange and overlap between Lake Ohrid and its sister lake, Lake Prespa, despite the fact that the latter lake is a major water supplier for Lake Ohrid. Studies on selected species flocks and scatters, mostly in molluscs, point towards the assumption that only few lineages originally colonized Lake Ohrid from the Balkans and that the majority of endemic species seen today probably started to evolve within the lake during the early Pleistocene. Within the Ohrid watershed, endemism occurs at different spatial and taxonomic scales, ranging from species endemic to certain parts of Lake Ohrid to species endemic to the whole watershed and from subspecies to genus level and possibly beyond. Modes of speciation in the Ohrid watershed are largely affected by its degree of isolation. Observational evidence points towards both allopatric (peripatric) and parapatric speciation. Though sympatric speciation within a habitat is conceivable, so far there are no known examples. Today, the lake suffers from increasing anthropogenic pressure and a "creeping biodiversity crisis". Some endemic species presumably have already gone extinct, and there are also indications of invasive species penetrating Lake Ohrid. The comparatively small size of Lake Ohrid and the extremely small range of many endemic species, together with increasing human pressure make its fauna particularly vulnerable. It is thus hoped that this review will encourage future research on the ecology and evolutionary biology of the lake's taxa, the knowledge of which would ultimately help protecting this unique European biodiversity hot spot.

T1  - Mass mortality of the invasive bivalve <i>Corbicula fluminea</i> induced by a severe low-water event and associated low water temperatures
AN  - 821391129
AB  - The Asian clam Corbicula fluminea, originating from Southeast Asia, was first recorded in Lake Constance in 2003 and developed local mass occurrences afterwards. Effects of harsh winter conditions in 2005/2006 associated with a strongly decreasing water level were studied at three different depths at and below the mean low water level (MLL, MLL −1 m and MLL −3 m). Low winter temperatures produced a massive die-off of the C. fluminea population. The mortality of the clams was size class and depth dependent. At the mean low water level (MLL), all clams died because of lying dry. However, at MLL −1 m and at MLL −3 m, mortality was a consequence of water temperatures around 2°C for nearly 3 months. At MLL −3 m, clams >5 mm died later than young clams <5 mm and later than clams of all sizes at MLL −1 m. But in late spring even the clams >5 mm at MLL −3 m were dead and only about 1% of the overall population of C. fluminea survived the winter conditions until spring 2006.Lethal effects of low water temperatures on C. fluminea, which may become effective only after a time lag, were corroborated in an outdoor mesocosm experiment with constant water level and without predation.

T1  - Two cryptic species of the Hediste diversicolor group (Polychaeta, Nereididae) in the Baltic Sea, with mitochondrial signatures of different population histories
AN  - 208064529
AB  - A presence of two cryptic biological species of Hediste diversicolor complex polychaetes was corroborated in a geographical survey of some 30 populations from the eastern and southern coasts of the Baltic Sea, with data from four completely diagnostic allozyme characters. Species A was dominant in the northernmost part of the Baltic Hediste range (Bothnian Sea), whereas Species B alone was found in the south (Poland, Germany, Denmark). In the intervening region, comprising the majority of the sites studied in southern Finland and Estonia, the two species were usually found together, with no evidence of recent hybridisation (i.e., no heterozygote genotypes). While mitochondrial DNA also distinguished the two taxa, it was not similarly completely diagnostic, but there were rare cases (ca 5%) of lineage mismatch indicating that some introgression has occurred in the past. Comparison with published data suggests that species A also inhabits the North Sea-NE Atlantic-Mediterranean coasts, and species B is also present in the North Sea and the NW Atlantic (Canada). Within the Baltic, the two species show distinctly different patterns of mtDNA diversity, plausibly related to different colonisation histories. Species A shows a generally high haplotype and nucleotide diversity, whereas in species B we found only four deeply diverged groups of closely related haplotypes. Hypothetically this could indicate a recent expansion of species B from a small number of colonising individuals. Moreover, species B showed marked intraspecific geographical structuring, with co-incident genetic changes along the N Estonian-S Finnish coasts both in mtDNA and an allozyme marker; this pattern suggests a contact between two genetically distinct invasion waves of different origins. In all, species A and B represent good, reproductively isolated and partly sympatric species which require to be recognised in ecological work. A formal taxonomical description is needed, but awaits better, range-wide distributional and ecological characterisation and working out of morphological differences that enable a practical identification.

T1  - Microsatellite variation in the oyster Crassostrea plicatula along the coast of China
AN  - 199338521
AB  - Genetic diversity and differentiation of the oyster Crassostrea plicatula populations from China's coast were studied based on seven microsatellite loci. All loci showed high polymorphism for all five C. plicatula populations, with an average number of allele per locus of 19.3-27.9 and an average expected heterozygosity of 0.889-0.952. Significant departures from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and deficits of heterozygotes were observed over most populations at each locus, which were fully explained by null alleles. Microsatellite analysis revealed significant subdivision in the C. plicatula populations. According to the neighbor-joining tree constructed on the basis of the D                         A distance, the five populations fell into three regional groups, showing a relatively homogeneous genetic structure in geographically close populations. Assignation tests correctly assigned high percentages of individuals to their original populations and groups, and also confirmed the existence of genetic differentiation among C. plicatula populations. The results obtained in this study will facilitate the formulation of appropriate fisheries management programs, stock identification and conservation of biodiversity for the species.

AB  - Issue Title: Ecological Effects of Water-Level Fluctuations in Lakes / Guest Editors: K.M. Wantzen, K.-O. Rothhaupt, M. Mörtl, M. Cantonati, L.G.-Tóth and P. Fischer              This paper delivers a conceptual framework for the ecological functioning and biodiversity patterns of lakes that is based on the floodpulse concept (FPC). The specific characteristics of rivers and lakes considering water-level fluctuations are compared, with respect to catchment linkages, temporal patterns, and hydraulic forces of flooding and drawdown. The influences of floodpulses on element cycles, biodiversity, and adaptations of lake biota are analyzed, and the importance of multi-annual flooding cycles is highlighted. The degree by which these water-level fluctuations influence lake ecosystems strongly depends on lake morphology, where shallow lakes or those with large shallow margins are the most sensitive. Although floodpulses play a major role for ecosystem services such as lake management and climate change mitigation schemes, this issue is only scarcely dealt with. Tenets of the extended FPC for lakes are formulated in order to overcome this problem. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Aquatic risk assessment of pesticides in surface waters in and adjacent to the Everglades and Biscayne National Parks: I. Hazard assessment and problem formulation

AB  - Issue Title: Special issue on Ecotoxicology and Risk Issues in South Florida. Guest Editors:  Gary M. Rand, Pamela M. Bachman and Emily C. Rogevich

              
An aquatic risk assessment under the U.S. Environment Protection Agency (EPA) ecological risk framework was conducted for atrazine, metolachlor, malathion, chlorpyrifos, and endosulfan in the C-111 freshwater basin (eastern boundary of the Everglades National Park), northeast Florida Bay, and south Biscayne Bay in South Florida. Based on the use of the hazard quotient approach, measured concentrations of chlorpyrifos and endosulfan in surface waters suggest potential hazards to aquatic organisms and were, therefore, considered as chemicals of potential ecological concern (COPECs). The problem formulation included an overview of the physical/chemical and environmental fate characteristics and aquatic toxicology of the COPECs. Background surface water exposure concentrations of endosulfan and toxicity data from laboratory and field studies indicate that fish and invertebrate mortality may be a concern when endosulfan is applied in agricultural areas near aquatic ecosystems.

T1  - An Assessment of Endocrine Disruption in Mollusks and the Potential for Developing Internationally Standardized Mollusk Life Cycle Test Guidelines
AN  - 210701543
AB  - This paper summarizes what is known about the endocrine systems of mollusks and how they can be disrupted by exogenous substances. It then examines the various possibilities for using mollusk-based toxicity tests to detect and assess the environmental risks of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). It is concluded that there are no internationally standardized tests with mollusks available at present that are suitable for assessing the risks of long-term exposure to EDCs but that several published methods show potential. At the present state of knowledge, the most promising mollusk species for use in partial life cycle testing is probably the fresh- and brackish-water mesogastropod, Potamopyrgus antipodarum, which is known to be responsive to both direct and indirect androgens and to estrogens (and their mimics). Less experience of full life cycle testing exists with mollusks, but the freshwater pulmonate gastropod Lymnaea stagnalis at present offers the best possibility for a practical procedure. In both cases, there is a need for substantial test optimization and validation before these procedures could form the basis of international guidelines. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Molecular identification key based on PCR/RFLP for three polychaete sibling species of the genus Marenzelleria, and the species' current distribution in the Baltic Sea
AN  - 205280758
AB  - Studies of Marenzelleria species were often hampered by identification uncertainties when using morphological characters only. A newly developed PCR/RFLP protocol allows a more efficient discrimination of the three species Marenzelleria viridis, Marenzelleria neglecta and Marenzelleria arctia currently known for the Baltic Sea. The protocol is based on PCR amplification of two mitochondrial DNA gene segments (16S, COI) followed by digestion with restriction enzymes. As it is faster and cheaper than PCR/sequencing protocols used so far, the protocol is recommended for large-scale analyses. The markers allow an undoubted determination of species irrespective of life stage or condition of the worms in the samples. The protocol was validated on about 950 specimens sampled at more than 30 sites of the Baltic and the North Sea, and on specimens from populations of the North American east coast. Besides this test we used mitochondrial DNA sequences (16S, COI, Cytb) and starch gel electrophoresis to further investigate the distribution of the three Marenzelleria species in the Baltic Sea. The results show that M. viridis (formerly genetic type I or M. cf. wireni) occurred in the Öresund area, in the south western as well as in the eastern Baltic Sea, where it is found sympatric with M. neglecta. Allozyme electrophoresis indicated an introduction by range expansion from the North Sea. The second species, M. arctia, was only found in the northern Baltic Sea, where it sometimes occurred sympatric with M. neglecta or M. viridis. For Baltic M. arctia, the most probable way of introduction is by ship ballast water from the European Arctic. There is an urgent need for a new genetic analysis of all Marenzelleria populations of the Baltic Sea to unravel the current distribution of the three species. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Barnacle growth rate on artificial substrate in the Salton Sea, California
AN  - 195899423
AB  - Issue Title: The Salton Sea Centennial Symposium. Proceedings of a Symposium Celebrating a Century of Symbiosis Among Agriculture, Wildlife and People, 1905-2005, held in San Diego, California, USA, March 2005 / Guest editor: Stuart H. Hurlbert

              
The Salton Sea is one of the few saline, inland lakes in the world with a population of barnacles, Balanus amphitrite. It is also one of California's most impaired water bodies due to excessive nutrient loading which leads to phytoplankton blooms and low dissolved oxygen. Currently, B. amphitrite growth is limited due to lack of hard substrate in and around the Sea. We have hypothesized that artificial substrate could support the growth of B. amphitrite and their filter-feeding would lead to improved water quality. Periodic harvesting of the barnacles would result in the permanent removal of nitrogen and phosphorus from the Sea. A 44-day in-situ experiment was carried out in the Salton Sea to assess the rate of barnacle growth and phosphorus and nitrogen sequestration on burlap sheets suspended vertically from a floating line. Burlap panels were collected weekly and the barnacles analyzed for Ca, total-P, inorganic-P, total-N, total-C, CaCO3, and organic matter content. After 44 days of growth, the barnacle mats weighed 7.4 kg m-2 on a dry weight basis, with 80% of the mass as shell material. The nutrient sequestration was 9.4 g P m-2 and 100 g N m-2. Approximately half of the P was inorganic and appears to be coprecipitated with the calcium carbonate shell material. Results indicate that harvesting barnacles grown on artificial substrate in the Salton Sea would not be an effective method for removing N or P from the lake because of the relative proportions of shell material and organic material.

T1  - Evaluation of DNA damage in Chinese toad (Bufo bufo gargarizans) after in vivo exposure to sublethal concentrations of four herbicides using the comet assay
AN  - 214681427; 18297398
AB  - Chinese toad, Bufo bufo gargarizans, is frequently found in rice fields, muddy ponds, wetlands and other aquatic ecosystems in China. Because of its habitat, it has many chances of being exposed to pesticides, such as acetochlor, butachlor, chlorimuron-ethyl, and paraquat, which are extensively used in rice or cereal fields. Amphibians may serve as model organisms for determining the genotoxic effects of pollutants contaminating these areas. In the present study DNA damage was evaluated in the Chinese toad using the comet assay, as a potential tool for the assessment of ecogenotoxicity. The first step was to determine the acute toxicity of the above-mentioned herbicides. In acute tests, tadpoles were exposed to a series of relatively high concentrations of acetochlor, butachlor, chlorimuron-ethyl, and paraquat for 96 h. The LC
50 (96 h) of acetochlor, butachlor, chlorimuron-ethyl and paraquat were measured as 0.76, 1.32, 20.1 and 164 mg·l-1, respectively. Also, negative effects on the behavior of tadpoles were observed with acetochlor, butachlor, and paraquat. Secondly, the comet assay was used for detecting DNA damage in Chinese toad tadpoles exposed to sublethal concentrations of four herbicides. Significant (
P < 0.05) concentration-dependent increase in DNA damage (as indicated by tail length, tail moment, olive tail moment) were observed from erythrocytes of tadpoles exposed to sublethal concentrations of acetochlor, butachlor, paraquat, and methyl methanesulfonate, except chlorimuron-ethyl. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the use of
 Bufo bufo gargarizans for genotoxicity assessment of herbicides. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Allochthonous inputs of detritus represent an important energy source for streams in forested regions, but dynamics of these materials are not well studied in neotropical headwater streams. As part of the tropical amphibian declines in streams (TADS) project, we quantified benthic organic matter standing stocks and organic seston dynamics in four Panamanian headwater streams, two with (pre-amphibian decline) and two without (post-decline) healthy amphibian assemblages. We also measured direct litterfall and lateral litter inputs in two of these streams. Continuous litterfall and monthly benthic samples were collected for 1 year, and seston was collected 1-3 times/month for 1 year at or near baseflow. Direct litterfall was similar between the two streams examined, ranging from 934-1,137 g DM m-2 y-1. Lateral inputs were lower, ranging from 140-187 g DM m-1 y-1. Dead leaves (57-60%), wood (24-29%), and green leaves (8-9%) contributed most to inputs, and total inputs were generally higher during the rainy season. Annual habitat-weighted benthic organic matter standing stocks ranged from 101-171 g AFDM m-2 across the four study reaches, with 4 × higher values in pools compared to erosional habitats. Total benthic organic matter (BOM) values did not change appreciably with season, but coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM, >1 mm) generally decreased and very fine particulate organic matter (VFPOM, 1.6-250 μm) generally increased during the dry season. Average annual seston concentrations ranged from 0.2-0.6 mg AFDM l-1 (fine seston, <754 μm >250 μm) and 2.0-4.7 mg AFDM l-1 (very fine, <250 μm >1.6 μm), with very fine particles composing 85-92% of total seston. Quality of fine seston particles in the two reaches where tadpoles were present was significantly higher (lower C/N) than the two where tadpoles had been severely reduced (P = 0.0028), suggesting that ongoing amphibian declines in this region are negatively influencing the quality of particles exported from headwaters. Compared to forested streams in other regions, these systems receive relatively high amounts of allochthonous litter inputs but have low in-stream storage.  (PUBLICATION ABSTRACT)

T1  - Guidance for Evaluating In Vivo Fish Bioaccumulation Data
AN  - 210702367
AB  - Currently, the laboratory-derived fish bioconcentration factor (BCF) serves as one of the primary data sources used to assess the potential for a chemical to bioaccumulate. Consequently, fish BCF values serve a central role in decision making and provide the basis for development of quantitative structure-property relationships (QSPRs) used to predict the bioaccumulation potential of untested compounds. However, practical guidance for critically reviewing experimental BCF studies is limited. This lack of transparent guidance hinders improvement in predictive models and can lead to uninformed chemical management decisions. To address this concern, a multiple-stakeholder workshop of experts from government, industry, and academia was convened by the International Life Sciences Institute Health and Environmental Sciences Institute to examine the data availability and quality issues associated with in vivo fish bioconcentration and bioaccumulation data. This paper provides guidance for evaluating key aspects of study design and conduct that must be considered when judging the reliability and adequacy of reported laboratory bioaccumulation data. Key criteria identified for judging study reliability include 1) clear specification of test substance and fish species investigated, 2) analysis of test substance in both fish tissue and exposure medium, 3) no significant adverse effects on exposed test fish, and 4) a reported test BCF that reflects steady-state conditions with unambiguous units. This guidance is then applied to 2 data-rich chemicals (anthracene and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin) to illustrate the critical need for applying a systematic data quality assessment process. Use of these guidelines will foster development of more accurate QSPR models, improve the performance and reporting of future laboratory studies, and strengthen the technical basis for bioaccumulation assessment in chemicals management.

T1  - Are Late-Spring Boreal Lesser Scaup (Aythya Affinis) in Poor Body Condition
AN  - 196447262
AB  - In many waterfowl species, females in better body condition have greater reproductive success than those in poor condition; thus, large-scale changes in body condition could influence species' population dynamics. Indices of annual productivity have decreased in Lesser Scaup (Aythya affinis  ), and the "spring condition" hypothesis (SCH) has been proposed to account for poor production and low populations in this species. We compared nutrient reserves of female Lesser Scaup and Ring-necked Ducks (A. collaris  ) collected during the breeding season at multiple sites in the Canadian boreal forest, the region where ~70% of both species breed and where they have had contrasting population trends for the past 25 years. Lesser Scaup tended to carry greater somatic lipid but slightly lower protein reserves than Ring-necked Ducks, after controlling for size. The proportion of females developing follicles was similar in both species, though Lesser Scaup initiated egg development later and exhibited less temporal variance in nesting date than Ring-necked Ducks. We also directly tested the SCH by comparing contemporary arrival and prebreeding body masses of Lesser Scaup with historical values at one boreal-forest site. However, body masses of Lesser Scaup collected in 2003-2004 were comparable to those of Lesser Scaup collected at Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, during 1968-1970. Overall, our results suggest that currently, body condition of boreal-breeding Lesser Scaup is relatively similar to that of Ring-necked Ducks and to historical levels for Lesser Scaup. Future studies of factors that limit recovery of Lesser Scaup should examine migration patterns and the effects of climate change on the timing of both energetic requirements in Lesser Scaup and food-resource availability.

T1  - Models as tools for understanding past, recent and future changes in large lakes
AN  - 288411966
AB  - Issue Title: European Large Lakes - Ecosystem changes and their ecological and socioeconomic impacts / Guest Editors: Tiina Nõges, Reiner Eckmann, Külli Kangur, Peeter Nõges, Anu Reinart, Gulnara Roll, Heikki Simola and Markku Viljanen

              
Large lakes currently exhibit ecosystem responses to environmental changes such as climate and land use changes, nutrient loading, toxic contaminants, hydrological modifications and invasive species. These sources have impacted lake ecosystems over a number of years in various combinations and often in a spatially heterogeneous pattern. At the same time, many different kinds of mathematical models have been developed to help to understand ecosystem processes and improve cost-effective management. Here, the advantages and limitations of models and sources of uncertainty will be discussed. From these considerations and in view of the multiple environmental pressures, the following emerging issues still have to be met in order to improve the understanding of ecosystem function and management of large lakes: (1) the inclusion of thresholds and points-of-no-return; (2) construction of general models to simulate biogeochemical processes for a large number of lakes rather than for individual systems; (3) improvement of the understanding of spatio-temporal variability to quantify biogeochemical fluxes accurately; and (4) inclusion of biogeochemical linkages between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in model approaches to assess the effects of external environmental pressures such as land-use changes. The inclusion of the above-mentioned issues would substantially improve models as tools for the scientific understanding and cost-effective management of large lakes that are subject to multiple environmental pressures in a changing future.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The effect of selection treatments on Mytilus edulis, modifications of genetic and physiological characteristics
AN  - 208061723
AB  - This study examined the effects of two selection treatments (elevated water temperature and air exposure) on the genetic and physiological characteristics of the juvenile marine mussel, Mytilus edulis (<10 mm). Genetic effects were measured on five allozymes and fitness assessed using physiological tests to estimate energy balance (scope for growth) as well as size, growth and survival. The in vitro treatments resulted in 48% mortality from an air exposure of 11 h at 27 degrees C and 76% mortality from a 6-h exposure to 33 degrees C water. Survivors (n = 1,152) of each treatment along with controls (n = 2,304) were measured and randomly placed in compartmentalized cages. Mussels were deployed to three bays in Prince Edward Island, Canada and monitored over a 10-month period. Initially, both of the treatments had an effect on mussel size and increased the heterozygosity of the surviving mussels. Physiological analyses after 3 months in the field showed that the two treated mussels showed lower metabolic rate that the control group. After 10 months in the field, the treated mussels were larger and had lower mortality than the untreated control mussels. Unexplained environmental interaction in each of the bays had an effect on allelic frequencies and heterozygosity. Overall, the results demonstrate that simple husbandry techniques can be used to increase the productivity of mussel seed and heterozygosity measures can be used to assess fitness. However, more field data is needed to determine the consistency of the increased productivity and if the increased productivity justifies the costs of a selective treatment. Furthermore, because the level of heterozygosity in juvenile mussel populations can vary considerably, both spatially and temporally, it may be effective as a warning of future natural mass mortality when overall heterozygosity levels are found to be low.

T1  - Patterns of prey use by lesser scaup Aythya affinis (Aves) and diet overlap with fishes during spring migration
AN  - 195882704
AB  - Recent decline in the lesser scaup Aythya affinis population has been linked to changes in wetland conditions along their spring migration routes. In particular, the use of amphipod prey by lesser scaup has declined in many regions of the upper Midwest U.S.A. and has been linked to expanded fisheries, although empirical data on diet overlap are lacking. To explore patterns of prey use by lesser scaup and diet overlap with fishes, we quantified diets of scaup and fishes during the 2003 and 2004 spring migration in eastern South Dakota, U.S.A. We compared diet overlap between lesser scaup and fishes collected from Twin Lakes, South Dakota--an important stopover location for spring-migrating scaup. Plant seeds occurred in >95% of lesser scaup diets (n = 118) and represented an appreciable amount of consumed biomass (>70%). Gastropods, amphipods, and chironomids were the most abundant invertebrate prey taxa and occurred in 29-34% of lesser scaup diets. Although relatively frequent, these taxa each contributed only 4-27% of the diet by weight. Percent dry mass of amphipods, a preferred prey by lesser scaup, was low (4%) indicating that amphipod availability may be reduced during spring migration. Analysis of fish diets showed that black bullhead Ameiurus melas and yellow perch Perca flavescens had the highest diet overlap with lesser scaup at 94% and 92%, respectively. Moreover, mean size of amphipods and chironomids found in fish diets were significantly larger than that consumed by lesser scaup. Our findings support the notion that amphipod use by spring-migrating lesser scaup has declined and that size-selective predation by fishes may influence prey availability for lesser scaup.

The diversity of bacterial communities associated with the reed Phramites australis in Lake Velencei, Hungary, was analyzed using community-level physiological profiling and amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis, showing the importance of incubation times and media used for isolations (Borsodi et al., 2007b).

T1  - Lake and Reservoir Management
AN  - 926252322
AB  - Combining long-term measurements and projections from a Regional Climate Model, the potential impact of climate change on surface temperature and residence times of lakes in the English Lake District was assessed (George et al., 2007b).  (2007) investigated the effect of wind-induced internal waves on vertical distribution of zooplankton in Bautzen Reservoir (Germany) and concluded that classical limnological field sampling can lead to severely biased estimates of zooplankton abundance due to the interfering effects of hydrophysical processes like internal waves.

T1  - A new lessepsian species in the western Mediterranean (Brachidontes pharaonis Bivalvia: Mytilidae): density, resource allocation and biomass
AN  - 218722741
AB  - The present study reports on population dynamics and growth performance relative to a lesser known exotic invasive species (Brachidontes pharaonis) inhabiting the southern Mediterranean. The study was carried out in western Sicily, where B. pharaonis is present on both the submerged and emerged surfaces of a hyperhaline saltpan. Individuals were scraped, counted and measured for shell length, total weight, somatic, gonadic and shell biomass. Brachidontes pharaonis intensively colonized all hard substrates of the saltpan with annual average densities of 375 ± 293 ind. 400 cm-2 with density peaks in autumn as a function of habitat. The occurrence of juveniles was different for mediolittoral and infralittoral populations as was mean size, spawning periods and annual organic matter biomass. Organic matter allocated to the shells represented 56.4% (of the total), gonad allocation was 7.3%, while somatic allocation averaged 36.3% for both populations. Brachidontes pharaonis reached high individual density, rare among temperate members of the genus Mytilus in Mediterranean and European waters, but common in tropical dense mussel beds. Considering its invasive potential and the recent warming trend of the Mediterranean, in the future B. pharaonis may actively invade more habitats, threatening indigenous bivalve species which may be unable to compete with B. pharaonis in terms of reproductive effort and density.

T1  - Ontogenetic changes in small-scale movement by recruits of an exploited mussel: implications for the fate of larvae settling on algae
AN  - 208065991
AB  - Many South African populations of the brown mussel Perna perna have been depleted through over-exploitation by subsistence harvesters. This is problematic because recovery after disturbance is very slow, partly because recruits are largely associated with adult mussels. However, unlike large recruits of 3.5-10 mm that exhibit spatial structure related to that of adults, a very high proportion of settlers and small recruits (0-3.5 mm) occur on foliose algae. We tested the hypothesis that recruits on algae move to adult mussel beds after a period of growth, with the null hypothesis that they die at a certain size. We conducted an indirect field study comparing the ratios of large to small recruits in 100% cover mussel patches at locations with high and low algal cover. A second laboratory experiment analysed whether the size of recruits on algae affects their active movement behaviour in response to nearby mussel patches. Large/small recruit ratios were slightly, but not significantly greater in high than low algal cover locations. Both small (2-2.5 mm) and medium (4.5-5.5 mm) recruits remained on algae and moved very short distances throughout the laboratory experiment, while larger recruits (9-10 mm) moved significantly further distances and more often into mussel patches. The results suggest that very large recruits are able to migrate actively to nearby mussel patches, indicating ontogenetic shifts in this behaviour. However, the absence of a significant difference in ratios between field locations with high and low algal cover suggests many large recruits are accidentally dislodged from the algae and presumably die. Thus settlement of P. perna onto algae is likely to be wasted, with consequences for sustainable management of the mussel resource. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Impact of exotic invasive species in the cooling network of the Cartuja'93 technological park (Seville)
AN  - 1943165202
AB  - EMASESA has been monitoring the biological colonization in the Cartuja Island raw water network since 2001. Water from the Guadalquivir River dock, which circulates through this network, is meant for irrigation of the green areas and for the air conditioning of the buildings in the Cartuja 93 Science and Technology Park. The results of this study have highlighted that in the biological colonization of the distribution network three exotic invasive species are involved: the bivalves Mytilopsis leucophaeata and Corbicula fluminea, along with the hydrozoan Cordylophora caspia. The colonization is principally registered at the beginning of the network in the pumping station facilities. The C. caspia and M. leucophaeata have experienced the biggest growth, and the hydrozoan has had the biggest effect on the distribution network. The biological growth in the network has been tackled in two ways: (1) eliminating the existing colonization i.e. acting on the adult specimens while manually cleaning the larger diameter pipes and (2) preventing new outbreaks by using a non-oxidizing and fast hydrolysing biocide and using a TBT-free anti-fouling paint.

T1  - Geo-feasibility of in situ sediment capping in a Great Lakes urban estuary: a sediment budget assessment
AN  - 304920872
AB  - Presque Isle Bay is one of 40 remaining environmental areas of concern (AoCs) on the North American Great Lakes that have one or more water, habitat, or sediment quality impairments as defined by the International Joint Commission. In situ natural capping using sediment from to-be-remediated watersheds and other potential sources is being considered as the most feasible means of remediating an existing contaminated sediment problem at this site. A multi-decade (40 year) sediment budget shows that, when localized anthropogenic effects (dredging, reclamation) are discounted, the bay net-accumulated sediment over time. Sediment was supplied from three major sources: bank erosion and bluff retreat (41%), streams (25%), and the Lake Erie littoral system (20%). The non-stream sources supply environmentally clean materials from ancient beach and glacio-lacustrine deposits along the shoreline, and from the modern littoral system. Organic and metallic contaminants supplied primarily by streams and run-off remain a remediation challenge for the AoC. Geologically, natural capping of contaminants over the next several decades is a viable solution for most of the bay. The mechanism may not work effectively in all areas because approximately 25% of the bay floor is moderately net-erosional while several localized areas accumulate sediments very slowly at decadal timescales.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Temporal Trends of Young-of-Year Fishes in Lake Erie and Comparison of Diel Sampling Periods
AN  - 375646591; 16957842
AB  - We explored temporal trends of young-of-year (YOY) fishes caught in bottom trawl hauls at an established offshore monitoring site in Lake Erie in fall during 1961-2001. Sampling was conducted during morning, afternoon, and night in each year. Catches per hour (CPH) of alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) YOY were relatively low and exhibited no temporal trend. This result was consistent with the species' intolerance to Lake Erie's adverse winter water temperatures. Gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum) YOY decreased sharply after 1991, which was consistent with recent oligotrophication of the lake. Following the establishment in 1979 and rapid increase of white perch (Morone americana) YOY, white bass (Morone chrysops) and freshwater drum (Aplodinotus grunniens) YOY decreased. Trout-perch (Percopsis omiscomaycus) YOY decreased during 1986-1991, but recovered to previous levels during 1991-2001. The recovery coincided with the resurgence of mayflies (Ephemoptera) in the lake. CPH of spottail shiner (Notropis hudsonius) and emerald shiner (N. atherinoides) YOY exhibited no temporal trend between 1961 and the late 1970s to early 1980s. CPH of yellow perch (Perca flavescens) YOY decreased during 1961-1988, and walleye (Sander vitreum) YOY increased overall during the time series. These observations were consistent with published studies of adults in the region. CPH of 4 of the 10 species of YOY considered were greatest during night. CPH for walleye YOY was higher in the morning than in the afternoon, but there was no significant difference between night and morning abundances. The results suggest that (1) CPH of YOY fishes may be a useful monitoring tool for Lake Erie, and (2) offshore monitoring programs that do not include night sampling periods may underestimate recruitment for several common species.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Conservation of Aquatic Resources through the Use of Freshwater Protected Areas: Opportunities and Challenges
AN  - 366395081
AB  - Freshwater environments are currently experiencing an alarming decline in biodiversity. As a result, scientists and managers must look for alternative management techniques to protect these aquatic systems. One such option that has potential to protect freshwater environments from numerous threats is the use of freshwater protected areas (FPAs). FPAs are portions of the freshwater environment partitioned to minimize disturbances and allow natural processes to govern populations and ecosystems. While similar conservation practices are well established in the terrestrial and marine environments, the use of FPAs for conservation of freshwater environments has been relatively slow. Despite this, numerous examples exist in which FPAs have been incorporated into successful management approaches for freshwater environments. In this paper, we outline some of the past success stories where FPAs have been used to protect freshwater environments, discuss some of the reasons that this technique has not proliferated to the same degree as marine protected areas, and present some of the challenges that managers and scientists must overcome if they wish to implement FPAs. We recommend that the term Freshwater Protected Area be adopted to such conservation efforts, thereby standardizing terminology and facilitating literature searches and dissemination of research findings. Furthermore, we encourage freshwater scientists, conservationists and managers to develop and implement FPAs in innovative and creative situations thereby permitting the growth of the research base for this valuable conservation technique.

T1  - Temporal Trends of Young-of-Year Fishes in Lake Erie and Comparison of Diel Sampling Periods
AN  - 2664207938
AB  - We explored temporal trends of young-of-year (YOY) fishes caught in bottom trawl hauls at an established offshore monitoring site in Lake Erie in fall during 1961–2001. Sampling was conducted during morning, afternoon, and night in each year. Catches per hour (CPH) of alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) YOY were relatively low and exhibited no temporal trend. This result was consistent with the species’ intolerance to Lake Erie’s adverse winter water temperatures. Gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum) YOY decreased sharply after 1991, which was consistent with recent oligotrophication of the lake. Following the establishment in 1979 and rapid increase of white perch (Morone americana) YOY, white bass (Morone chrysops) and freshwater drum (Aplodinotus grunniens) YOY decreased. Trout-perch (Percopsis omiscomaycus) YOY decreased during 1986–1991, but recovered to previous levels during 1991–2001. The recovery coincided with the resurgence of mayflies (Ephemoptera) in the lake. CPH of spottail shiner (Notropis hudsonius) and emerald shiner (N. atherinoides) YOY exhibited no temporal trend between 1961 and the late 1970s to early 1980s. CPH of yellow perch (Perca flavescens) YOY decreased during 1961–1988, and walleye (Sander vitreum) YOY increased overall during the time series. These observations were consistent with published studies of adults in the region. CPH of 4 of the 10 species of YOY considered were greatest during night. CPH for walleye YOY was higher in the morning than in the afternoon, but there was no significant difference between night and morning abundances. The results suggest that (1) CPH of YOY fishes may be a useful monitoring tool for Lake Erie, and (2) offshore monitoring programs that do not include night sampling periods may underestimate recruitment for several common species.

T1  - Pollution-induced heat shock protein expression in the amphipod Gammarus roeseli is affected by larvae of Polymorphus minutus (Acanthocephala)
AN  - 213510354; 17578599
AB  - Abstract

              
The relationship between the exposure of organisms to chemicals and subsequent alterations in various biochemical processes (commonly referred to as biomarkers) is of growing importance in environmental and ecotoxicological research. However, parasites which also affect the physiological homeostasis of their hosts, and thus may alter biomarker reactions, are usually ignored in environmental research. To address this deficit, we have used the host-parasite system Gammarus roeseli naturally infected with cystacanths of the acanthocephalan Polymorphus minutus to investigate whether infection of gammarids with parasites alters their heat shock protein response following exposure to palladium (Pd). After 24 days of metal exposure relative levels of heat shock protein hsp70 were analysed in the tissues of parasites and intermediate hosts. Simultaneously, the metal accumulation in gammarids and parasites was determined. As none of the infected gammarids showed hsp70 levels at the end of the Pd exposure (either exposed or not), infected and unparasitized G. roeseli were exposed to heat. Again, only uninfected gammarids showed a temperature-dependent increase in hsp70 levels. Interestingly, although the intermediate hosts showed no hsp70 response, exposure to Pd and heat results in increasing hsp70 in the parasites within in the haemocoel of G. roeseli. Heat experiments with isolated cystacanths also showed increasing hsp70 levels in P. minutus with temperature. Concerning uninfected G. roeseli, exposure to Pd and heat causes a hsp70 response. Pd concentrations were found to be higher in the larval parasites than in the gammarids. This result clearly contradicts previous results, as high metal accumulation was so far only described from adult acanthocephalans. Our findings provide experimental evidence that parasites alter the biomarker responses of their host and that the infection status of test animals is extremely important for ecotoxicological studies.

T1  - Environmental Stress Determines the Quality of Bacterial Lysate and Its Utilization Efficiency in a Simple Microbial Loop
AN  - 821116155
AB  - Heterotrophic bacteria provide the critical link in the microbial loop by converting dissolved organic matter (DOM) into particulate form. In this study, DOM was prepared from recently isolated estuarine bacterial strain Vibrio sp. (DSM14379) grown at different salinities [0.2%, 0.5%, 3%, 5%, or 10% (w/v)], washed, concentrated, and lysed by autoclaving. The corresponding lysate-containing media were designated LM0.2, LM0.5, LM3, LM5, and LM10. Vibrio sp. cells grown at different salinities had similar C/N/P ratios, but different C/S ratios, different trace element composition, and different 2D gel electrophoresis protein profiles. Pseudoalteromonas sp. (DSM06238) isolated from a similar environment was able to grow on all lysates, and its biomass production was dependent on lysate type. The highest growth rate and biomass production of Pseudoalteromonas sp. at saturation lysate concentrations were observed in LM3. The biomass production at saturation lysate concentrations was about 3-fold higher as compared to LM0.2 and LM10. The initial respiration rate, intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, and 3H-Leu and 3H-TdR incorporation rates were lowest in LM3. On the other hand, in LM0.2 or LM10 lysates the situation was reversed, the growth rates and biomass production were lowest, whereas 3H-Leu and 3H-TdR incorporation, respiration rates, as well as ATP levels, were highest. These results imply uncoupling of catabolism from growth in either high- or low-salinity lysates. The results also suggest that differences in organic carbon quality generated during Vibrio sp. growth at different NaCl concentrations were propagated through the simple microbial loop, which may have important ecological implications for higher trophic levels that depend on microbial grazing.

T1  - Monitoring of Organic Compounds and Trace Metals During a Dredging Episode in the Göta Älv Estuary (SW Sweden) Using Caged Mussels
AN  - 2665407372
AB  - The concentrations of selected trace metals, organotins, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were determined in caged blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) during dredging operations in the Göta Älv Estuary (SW Sweden). Maximum values of pollutants in mussel tissues were found after the dredging started. Our results showed that the dredging caused mobilization of organotins from the sediments to the water column during the experimental period. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) and cluster analysis were applied to compare and establish relationships between levels of pollutants in mussels and sampling sites during the experimental period. In order to evaluate the biological effects of contaminants, genotoxic damage was measured using the Comet assay, and its potential application for environmental monitoring is discussed.

T1  - Review of Aquatic In Situ Approaches for Stressor and Effect Diagnosis
AN  - 210699903
AB  - Field-based (in situ) approaches are used increasingly for measuring biological effects and for stressor diagnoses in aquatic systems because these assessment tools provide realistic exposure environments that are rarely replicated in laboratory toxicity tests. Providing realistic exposure scenarios is important because environmental conditions can alter toxicity through complex exposure dynamics (e.g., multiple stressor interactions). In this critical review, we explore the information provided by aquatic in situ exposure and monitoring methods when compared with more traditional approaches and discuss the associated strengths and limitations of these techniques. In situ approaches can, under some circumstances, provide more valuable information to a decision maker than information from surveys of resident biota, laboratory toxicity tests, or chemical analyses alone. A decision tree is provided to assist decision makers in determining when in situ approaches can add value. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Importance of heterotrophic planktonic communities in a mussel culture environment: the Grande Entree lagoon, Magdalen Islands (Quebec, Canada)
AN  - 208071612
AB  - Mussel culture in coastal environments relies on the availability of food of sufficient quality and quantity. Both to determine this availability and to examine impacts that this aquaculture practice may have on the environment, it is important to have good knowledge of the type of plankton communities present in aquaculture sites. It is usually thought that phytoplankton make up the bulk of mussel diet in many of these sites. Here we show that the Grande-Entree lagoon [Magdalen Islands, Gulf of St Lawrence (GSL), Canada], where commercial mussel culture has been on-going since 1980, differs from this pattern. Heterotrophic protists dominate for most of the summer-early fall season (apart from short diatom bursts), with a high average biomass of 160 mg C m-3. The dominance of small-sized phytoplankton cells (notably green algae), low nutrient concentrations (e.g. 0.3 mcM NO3- on average) and high biomass of heterotrophic protists (mostly naked ciliates and tintinnids) all point to the importance of the microbial food web in this shallow marine environment. Sustained cultivation of suspended mussels in the lagoon suggests that these heterotrophic protists could be an important source of food for the mussels, supplementing the small amount of phytoplankton present.

T1  - A comparison of biofilms from macrophytes and rocks for taste and odour producers in the St. Lawrence River
AN  - 1943573640
AB  - Given their widespread and prolific annual development in the St. Lawrence River (SLR), macrophytes (i.e. submerged aquatic plants) represent large surface areas for biofilm growth and potentially important sites for associated production of taste and odour (T&O) compounds. We therefore evaluated the importance of submerged macrophytes and their associated biofilms for production of T&O compounds, 2-methylisoborneol (MIB) and geosmin (GM), compared with biofilms from adjacent rocks. We also tested the hypothesis that production of these compounds would differ between macrophyte species, based on the premise that they are not inert substrates but directly influence the communities that colonise their surfaces. Samples collected from transects across the SLR between Kingston and Cornwall, ON were dominated by the flat-bladed Vallisneria spp., and the leafed Myriophyllum spicatum, Elodea canadensis, Chara spp., Potamgeton spp., and Ceratophyllum spp. Overall, MIB and GM levels in biofilms ranged widely between samples. Expressed per g dry weight of biofilm, median levels from macrophyte were 50 (range 1-5,000) ng MIB g−1 and 10 (<1 to 580) ng GM g−1 compared with 50 (range 5-970) ng MIB g−1 and 160 (1-1,600) ng GM g−1 from rocks. Based on non-parametric statistical analysis, levels of GM were higher on a g dry weight basis in biofilms from rocks than macrophytes (P=0.02), but MIB levels were similar (P=0.94). However, when normalised for differences in substrate surface area (i.e. ng cm−2), levels of both MIB and GM were higher in biofilms from rocks than from macrophytes (P<0.01). There were no discernable differences in MIB and GM concentrations from biofilms of different macrophytes based on either g dry weight sample or surface area (P>0.05). Overlying water (OLW) concentrations ranged between 2-45 ng L−1 for MIB and 5-30 ng L−1 for GM and were not correlated with levels in adjacent biofilms. However, OLW concentrations peaked in shallow, low energy embayments consistent with enhanced production and release of MIB and GM in nearshore areas. The results support our previous work showing the importance of biofilms on various surfaces (rocks, macrophytes and zebra mussels) for MIB and GM production in the SLR, but suggest that inert surfaces like rocks are more productive sites per unit surface area than macrophytes.

T1  - Seasonal variations in population dynamics and biomass of two Unio pictorum mancus (Mollusca, Unionidae) populations from two lakes of different trophic state
AN  - 2417765773
AB  - Samples of Unio pictorum mancus collected monthly from spring 2003 to summer 2004 in the meso-oligotrophic Lake Maggiore and the eutrophic Lake Candia were compared to evaluate the influence of lake trophic conditions on mussel populations. Shell form, maximum age (8 years) and percentage of organic matter in the shell and soft tissues were similar in both lakes. However, comparisons between same size classes revealed that mussels from Lake Maggiore were generally older, their shells heavier and their soft tissues lighter than those from Lake Candia. Recruitment occurred in both populations in June-July. The frequency distributions of adult mussels (>30 mm) and their soft tissues and shell biomasses in all size classes (range = 2 mm) were normal, but the curves of the mussels from Lake Candia were flat in comparison to those of mussels from Lake Maggiore. The median body size of Lake Maggiore mussels was 58 mm, while that of the Lake Candia population was 72 mm. During the study period the population density of each lake was fairly constant, whereas the population structure, and consequently the biomass, showed seasonal variations. The greatest differences were found between population density and shell and tissue biomass of the two populations, which were respectively 46.86 ind. m-2; 408 g d.w. m-2 and 38.67 g d.w. m-2 in Lake Maggiore, and 6.93 ind. m-2; 92.29 g d.w. m-2 and 14.04 g d.w. m-2 in Lake Candia. These values testify to the phenotypical plasticity of Unio pictorum mancus in relation to environmental characteristics, without excluding a possible genetic influence as a result of geographical isolation and the respective selection mechanisms. The influence exerted by the lake trophic level and by the physical environment on some population characteristics is discussed.

T1  - HYDROLOGIC CONNECTIVITY AND THE CONTRIBUTION OF STREAM HEADWATERS TO ECOLOGICAL INTEGRITY AT REGIONAL SCALES1
AN  - 201352380
AB  - Cumulatively, headwater streams contribute to maintaining hydrologic connectivity and ecosystem integrity at regional scales. Hydrologic connectivity is the water-mediated transport of matter, energy and organisms within or between elements of the hydrologic cycle. Headwater streams compose over two-thirds of total stream length in a typical river drainage and directly connect the upland and riparian landscape to the rest of the stream ecosystem. Altering headwater streams, e.g., by channelization, diversion through pipes, impoundment and burial, modifies fluxes between uplands and downstream river segments and eliminates distinctive habitats. The large-scale ecological effects of altering headwaters are amplified by land uses that alter runoff and nutrient loads to streams, and by widespread dam construction on larger rivers (which frequently leaves free-flowing upstream portions of river systems essential to sustaining aquatic biodiversity). We discuss three examples of large-scale consequences of cumulative headwater alteration. Downstream eutrophication and coastal hypoxia result, in part, from agricultural practices that alter headwaters and wetlands while increasing nutrient runoff. Extensive headwater alteration is also expected to lower secondary productivity of river systems by reducing stream-system length and trophic subsidies to downstream river segments, affecting aquatic communities and terrestrial wildlife that utilize aquatic resources. Reduced viability of freshwater biota may occur with cumulative headwater alteration, including for species that occupy a range of stream sizes but for which headwater streams diversify the network of interconnected populations or enhance survival for particular life stages. Developing a more predictive understanding of ecological patterns that may emerge on regional scales as a result of headwater alterations will require studies focused on components and pathways that connect headwaters to river, coastal and terrestrial ecosystems. Linkages between headwaters and downstream ecosystems cannot be discounted when addressing large-scale issues such as hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico and global losses of biodiversity.

AB  - Many of these problems are documented in the executive summary of the 20OS Great Lakes Regional Collaboration Strategy (see sidebar), and well known to fisheries managers who are working to solve or mitigate the problems caused by AIS, overharvest, pollution, habitat degradation, and erratic weather patterns.  BEFORE THE 197Os, the Great Lakes were subjected to industrial pollution, raw sewage, gross habitat destruction, and exotic species such as sea lamprey, which spread through the lakes through a manmade canal system connected to the Atlantic, and an exploding alewife population that used the same route.

T1  - Integrative ecosystem analyses of phytoplankton dynamics in the York River estuary (USA)
AN  - 845178484
AB  - The relative importance of biotic (top-down) vs. abiotic (bottom-up) controls on phytoplankton dynamics was investigated in the York River estuary, Virginia (USA) by a combination of extensive analyses of long-term data sets collected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) monitoring program over 17 years (1984–2001), field studies (1996–1997) and ecosystem modeling analyses. Results from the analysis of long-term data records collected at three stations along the salinity gradient suggested that phytoplankton are more likely controlled by abiotic mechanisms such as resource limitation than biotic mechanisms such as grazing since annual cycles of primary production and phytoplankton biomass were similar and no grazing effects were evident based on the observed relationship between phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass (R2 < 0.2, p > 0.1). This scenario was supported by short-term field observations made over an annual cycle at three stations in the mid-channel of the estuary where both chlorophyll a and primary production demonstrated similar patterns of seasonal variation. Ratios of fluorescence before and after acidification at all study sites were relatively high suggesting low grazing pressure in the estuary. A tidally-averaged, size-structured plankton ecosystem model was previously developed and verified for the lower York River estuary. The validated ecosystem model was also used to examine this issue and simulation results supported the importance of bottom-up control in the York River estuary.

T1  - Biomarkers and Integrated Environmental Risk Assessment: Are There More Questions Than Answers?
AN  - 210702702
AB  - The introduction of the European Commission's Water Framework Directive (WFD; 2000/60/EC) established a new era in environmental risk assessment. In addition to incorporating the compliance of chemical quality standards, the key objective of the WFD is the general protection of the aquatic environment in its entirety. This new approach emphasizes the need for an integrated environmental risk assessment and offers the potential for the incorporation of biological effects measures, including the use of biomarkers in this process. Biomarkers have been suggested as practical tools for environmental management for a number of decades, but their inclusion has not been universally accepted because of a number of unanswered questions regarding sensitivity, practicality, and reproducibility. With this in mind, this paper addresses these potential questions and shows how, by taking a weight-of-evidence approach, biomarkers may be successfully incorporated within environmental risk assessment frameworks such as the WFD.

T1  - Long-term Developments in Ecological Rehabilitation of the Main Distributaries in the Rhine Delta: Fish and Macroinvertebrates
AN  - 821257644
AB  - Significant anthropogenic pressure in the Dutch part of the River Rhine is present from the 12th century. River engineering and water pollution were the main stress factors for flora and fauna. From the middle of the 20th century measures were taken to reduce water pollution. Recently, from 1987 onwards, these activities were put into a wider context of ecological river rehabilitation. Effects of improvements on fish and macroinvertebrates in the main distributaries in the Rhine delta are reviewed. The conclusions are that (a) most of the alterations in the Rhine delta are irreversible due to hard socio-economic boundary conditions (e.g. safety, navigation); (b) chances for the development of riverine biotopes have therefore to be found in the forelands and not in the main channels of the Rhine delta; (c) further reduction of pollutants, especially thermal pollution, is needed to help original species to colonise the Rhine delta again; (d) non-indigenous species clearly leave a mark on recolonisation possibilities of original species.

T1  - DISSOLVED HEAVY METALS IN SHALLOW GROUND WATER IN A SOUTHEASTERN MICHIGAN URBAN WATERSHED1
AN  - 201303686
AB  - The occurrence of dissolved heavy metal concentrations in shallow ground water were measured at 126 sites within an urban watershed in southeastern Michigan. A total of 1,140 samples were collected from the first saturated zone, and the mean concentrations of 11 heavy metals (arsenic, barium, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, mercury, nickel, selenium, silver, and zinc) were obtained and compared to their corresponding mean concentrations within surface soil. The results suggest that former and current land use processes have resulted in significant adverse impacts on the study region.. Levels of Cr 20 to 30 times the maximum contaminant level (MCL) have been detected in the ground water beneath industrial sites. In addition, Cd and Pb have been found at levels exceeding their MCLs where surface soils are clay-rich, and in sandy soils at more than 10 times their MCLs. The high levels of Cr in ground water strongly suggest that the chromium is in a hexavalent form, and this likelihood is supported by current studies. Given the hydraulic connection between the watershed's surface waters and the Great Lakes, these findings raise significant ecological and public health concerns. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The impact of food supply on phosphorus recycling by dreissenids mussels
AN  - 19856834; 7183202
AB  - Subsequent to the dreissenid mussels invasion in the Great Lakes there has been a reorganization of the nearshore ecosystem. One notable change is the increased biomass of the benthic macroalgae community. Phosphorus being a limiting resource within the Great Lakes, it has been suggested that phosphorus recycling by dreissenid mussels may contribute to this recent resurgence of benthic algae. Because phosphorus recycling by a consumer is dependent on the phosphorus content of the food and the phosphorus content of the consumers tissues, we hypothesized that phytoplankton concentration is a critical factor affecting the recycling of phosphorus by dreissenids. We conducted a series of experiments to determine the relationship between food supply and phosphorus recycling by dreissenids mussels. Initial results suggest that there is an inverse relationship between dreissenid phosphorus excretion rates and algae concentrations. A possible reason for this non-intuitive relationship is the dissolution of dreissenid tissue due to the affects of starvation.

T1  - Preservation of Autochthonous Shell Beds by Positive Feedback between Increased Hardpart-Input Rates and Increased Sedimentation Rates
AN  - 194437659
AB  - The preservation of nonrapidly buried autochthonous shell concentrations with noncementing epifaunal animals in life position presents a taphonomic dilemma if in fact an increase in shelliness is driven by a decrease in sedimentation rate. A 150-cm-thick, densely packed shell bed with brachiopods from the Lower Jurassic of Morocco shows lower levels of postmortem alteration than shell-poor beds, indicating that its formation is primarily governed by variations in hardpart-input rates. Varying dominance and size structure of the main shell producer, brachiopod Zeilleria rehmanni, indicate that its increased population density was the main trigger in the shell bed formation. Thinner and less common microbial crusts in the shell bed than in shell-poor beds indicate that higher shelliness is not due to lack of sediment. On the basis of actualistic data from modern mussel and oyster shell beds, the suspension feeding of a high-density population leads to high biodeposition rates through production of feces and pseudofeces, which substantially exceed natural sedimentation rates. In addition, shell-rich areas preferentially trap more suspended sediment than shell-poor areas. Therefore, an increase in population density of shelly biodeposit producers should lead to higher biodeposition rates. This assumption is supported by a positive correlation between brachiopod shelliness and pellet abundance. Both active biodeposition and passive trapping of sediment would have increased sedimentation rate, thus leading to a decreased rate of shell destruction through suppression of predators or borers as well as stabilization and protection of the shell concentration. Under optimum ecologic conditions, these processes result in a positive feedback between an increased hardpart-input rate and increased biogenic sedimentation rate. This scenario thus provides one alternative pathway for formation of well-preserved shell concentrations formed by epifaunal suspension feeders. Identifying the importance of biodeposition is of environmental significance because it implies that carbonate sediment was produced largely in situ and was directly or indirectly related to the activity of shell producers. Recognizing the role of varying hardpart-input rates in shell concentration genesis is of ecologic significance because shelliness can directly reflect abundance fluctuations of shell producers.

T1  - The invasive coconut mite Aceria guerreronis (Acari: Eriophyidae): origin and invasion sources inferred from mitochondrial (16S) and nuclear (ITS) sequences
AN  - 203165629; 16336700
AB  - Abstract

              
Over the past 30 years the coconut mite Aceria guerreronis Keifer has emerged as one of the most important pests of coconut and has recently spread to most coconut production areas worldwide. The mite has not been recorded in the Indo-Pacific region, the area of origin of coconut, suggesting that it has infested coconut only recently. To investigate the geographical origin, ancestral host associations, and colonization history of the mite, DNA sequence data from two mitochondrial and one nuclear region were obtained from samples of 29 populations from the Americas, Africa and the Indo-ocean region. Mitochondrial DNA 16S ribosomal sequences were most diverse in Brazil, which contained six of a total of seven haplotypes. A single haplotype was shared by non-American mites. Patterns of nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) variation were similar, again with the highest nucleotide diversity found in Brazil. These results suggest an American origin of the mite and lend evidence to a previous hypothesis that the original host of the mite is a non-coconut palm. In contrast to the diversity in the Americas, all samples from Africa and Asia were identical or very similar, consistent with the hypothesis that the mite invaded these regions recently from a common source. Although the invasion routes of this mite are still only partially reconstructed, the study rules out coconut as the ancestral host of A. guerreronis, thus prompting a reassessment of efforts using quarantine and biological control to check the spread of the pest.

T1  - conservation of freshwater and euryhaline elasmobranchs: a review
AN  - 224125993
AB  - published data on the diversity, life history, ecology, and status of freshwater and euryhaline elasmobranchs was reviewed in the context of anthropogenic threats and principles of conservation biology. at least 171 species of elasmobranch, representing 68 genera and 34 families, are recorded from fresh or estuarine waters. of these, over half are marginal in estuaries, less than one-tenth are euryhaline, and one-fifth are obligate in fresh water. obligate freshwater elasmobranchs are dominated by myliobatoid stingrays, of which two-thirds are potamotrygonids endemic to atlantic drainages of south america. freshwater and euryhaline elasmobranchs adhere to strongly k-selected life histories and feed at high trophic levels, similar to those of their marine relatives. however, freshwater and euryhaline elasmobranchs are also subject to habitat constraints, notably more limited volume and physicochemical variability than the ocean, that may render them more vulnerable than marine elasmobranchs to the effects of human activities. the greatest diversity and abundance of freshwater and euryhaline elasmobranchs occur in tropical countries with enormous and rapidly increasing human populations, notably south america, west africa, and south-east asia. knowledge of the biology, distribution, ecology, and status of freshwater and euryhaline elasmobranchs is frustrated by unresolved taxonomic problems, which are briefly summarized. to clarify selected issues in the conservation of freshwater and euryhaline elasmobranchs, special attention is given to sharks of the genus glyphis, pristids, and potamotrygonids. to foster live release when possible as well as prevent discard of specimens and loss of data, an illustrated key to differentiate carcharhinus from glyphis sharks is provided. obligate freshwater elasmobranchs with limited geographic ranges are deemed most vulnerable to extinction, but euryhaline elasmobranchs that require access to the sea to breed are also at significant risk. based on the foregoing data and principles of conservation biology, suggested action plans for the conservation of freshwater and euryhaline elasmobranchs and the conservation of freshwater habitats are provided.

T1  - Community analysis of Belarusian lakes: relationship of species diversity to morphology, hydrology and land use
AN  - 220256988
AB  - In the glacial lake district of northern Belarus, limnologists collected extensive biological, chemical and physical data on 550 lakes (51% of all Belarusian glacial lakes). This large data set provided a unique opportunity to examine subtle relationships with great statistical power. Our purpose was to use multivariate and correlation analyses to explore relationships of species richness with morphological and hydrological parameters. A multivariate analysis of the environmental data suggests that the Belarusian lakes can be separated along gradients of size, hydraulic residence time and watershed development (land use). In most instances, species richness for major planktonic and benthic groups was correlated significantly with lake size and land use. Species richness values were correlated less with watershed size or hydraulic residence time. In each community, there was a group of species characterized by higher correlations with principal component analysis (PCA) axes. These groups are as follows: for phytoplankton--diatoms, for zooplankton--rotifers, and for zoobenthos--molluscs. For lakes both in pristine and developed watersheds, we found small but significant negative species-area correlations for littoral crustaceans. A survey of the relevant literature shows scale dependence for the correlation between species richness and lake size. For pelagic crustaceans, the species-area correlation was significant (and positive) for lakes with developed watersheds but not for pristine watersheds.

T1  - Relationship between anti-oxidant capacity and manganese accumulation in the soft tissues of two freshwater molluscs: Unio pictorum mancus (Lamellibranchia, Unionidae) and Viviparus ater (Gastropoda, Prosobranchia)
AN  - 2417774213
AB  - Manganese is an element of great importance in the life cycle of plants and animals. For example, it plays an essential role as an activator of various enzymatic systems such as isoenzymes of superoxide dismutase. Freshwater Unionidae concentrate relatively large amounts of manganese in their tissues, but little is known about the physiological role of this metal. The aim of this research is to acquire a better knowledge of the role of manganese in molluscs which accumulate large amounts of this metal and in those with low manganese concentrations. As manganese is one of the metals present in the superoxide molecule, the possible relationship between manganese concentration in the soft tissues of molluscs and the antioxidant capacity of the metal can usefully be tested. To this end two species of molluscs were analysed: Unio pictorum mancus (Lamellibranchia, Unionidae), which is very rich in manganese, and Viviparus ater (Gastropoda, Prosobranchia) which has a low manganese content. The adults of both species were analysed for manganese concentration by ICP, and for antioxidant capacity as RAC (Relative Antioxidant Capacity) by a superoxide dismutase method. The results clearly demonstrate the active role played by manganese against free radicals and consequently the important role of the metal in protecting Unio against oxidative stress. The low concentration of manganese in Viviparus may be the result of the effective excretion of this metal, as was found for ruthenium.

T1  - Roach (Rutilus rutilus) as an important predator on blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) populations in a brackish water environment, the northern Baltic Sea
AN  - 208070721
AB  - Suspension-feeding bivalves are organisms of major functional importance in several aquatic environments around the world. They are also important food items for many fish and benthivorous seabirds. It has commonly been thought that predation pressure on blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) populations is negligible in the Baltic Sea, owing to the scarcity of major invertebrate predators such as starfish and crabs. It has recently been shown, however, that the blue mussel is the main food item for roach (Rutilus rutilus) in the archipelago areas of the western Gulf of Finland, where this freshwater fish species has become increasingly abundant, mainly due to increased eutrophication. To quantify the influence of roach predation on blue mussel populations we measured the standing biomass and size structure of the local blue mussel population and used a bioenergetic model to estimate mussel consumption by individual roach during two consecutive summers, 1997 and 1998. The results of the model were combined with existing data on roach abundance, giving annual consumption estimates of 75-105 kg blue mussel dry weight ha-1 in the study area, approximately two-thirds of these consumed mussels being >10 mm. This corresponds to approximately one-third of the standing population of mussels >10 mm in the area. Our results suggest that the predation effects of vertebrates on Baltic blue mussel populations are not insignificant, as previously believed. Predation by roach and other predators may have an important structuring effect on unstable blue mussel communities within the Gulf of Finland, where the species lives at the edge of its range.

T1  - Effects of temperature, salinity, and predators on mortality of and colonization by the invasive hydrozoan Moerisia lyonsi
AN  - 208071101
AB  - The successful invasion of non-indigeneous species depends on initial colonization as well as establishing a self-maintaining population. The invasive hydrozoan Moerisia lyonsi (Boulenger, 1908), possibly originating from low-salinity waters in the Black Sea and Middle East regions, has become established in low-salinity waters in several estuaries of North America, including Chesapeake Bay. The effects of temperature and salinity on mortality of M. lyonsi polyps were examined in the laboratory in February 2001 in the presence of abundant food. The polyps of M. lyonsi were directly transferred from 20 degrees C and 10 salinity to one of 45 combinations of temperature (10-29 degrees C) and salinity (1-40). Polyp mortality within 7 days occurred only in low-temperature treatments with salinities of 35-40. Surviving polyps reproduced asexually in salinities of 1-40 at 20-29 degrees C, and in salinities of 1-25 at 15 degrees C, but not in any salinities at 10 degrees C. The greatest asexual reproduction rates, an index for population survival potential, occurred at salinities of 5-20. Survival and reproduction of M. lyonsi over such broad temperature and salinity ranges indicate that M. lyonsi may colonize and establish populations throughout the Chesapeake Bay; however, M. lyonsi medusae were reported only at salinities <9.3 there. This discrepancy may be due to the effects of predators. The scyphomedusan Chrysaora quinquecirrha (Desor, 1848), but not the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi (A. Agassiz, 1865) consumed M. lyonsi medusae in laboratory experiments in August-September 2001. Populations of M. lyonsi do not appear to be limited by temperature and salinity conditions; however, their distribution in Chesapeake Bay may be restricted to low salinities not inhabited by predators.

T1  - The life history responses of the abalone pest, Terebrasabella heterouncinata, under natural and aquaculture conditions
AN  - 208067995
AB  - The sabellid, Terebrasabella heterouncinata, is a small (<5 mm) intratubular brooder that lives in burrows within the hostrsquos shell matrix. It is a semi-continuous breeder and despite producing small numbers of large eggs, infestation by this animal has reached epidemic proportions on local abalone farms. The present study compared the morphometrics and reproductive characteristics of worms from farmed and wild abalone, in the Walker Bay area of the south Western Cape Province of South Africa, to gain insights into why this animal has become so successful under aquaculture conditions. The farms designated farm A and farm B each had one on-farm site, and two wild sites, while farm C had two on-farm sites and two wild sites. The wild sites were natural abalone habitats located within 2.5 km of the farms. Our results conclusively showed that environmental conditions prevalent on the farms enhanced the reproductive success of these worms relative to that observed in its natural environment. At farms B and C, worms occurred in significantly higher densities at the on-farm sites than in the corresponding wild samples, but at farm A, density was equally low at the three sites. At all three farms, a greater proportion of the population was reproductively active in the on-farm samples than in the wild samples. Worms on farmed abalone had a higher instantaneous fecundity, brooded more clutches simultaneously and were larger than their conspecifics from the wild. There was a positive correlation between adult size and brood size and the number of clutches brooded simultaneously. Within the three on-farm sites there was a negative correlation between egg volume and brood size, indicating a trade-off between these traits. However, such a trade-off was not apparent between sites, with brood size being higher at the on-farm sites than at the wild sites, irrespective of egg size. This suggests that the stable nutrient-enriched environment on the farm led to an increase in fecundity without compromising the size (and implicitly the quality) of the eggs. Worm density did not have a significant effect on body size or any other reproductive traits at most sites, and the density of T. heterouncinata was unaffected by the density of other shell-infesting polychaetes. The results suggest that the farm environment has selected for larger, more fecund worms that breed rapidly with high recruitment success as a consequence of abundant nutrients, high host density, habitat stability and a possible lack of predation and interspecific competition.

T1  - Partitioning, bioavailability and effects of oestrogens and xeno-oestrogens in the aquatic environment
AN  - 224144587
AB  - This review provides insights into the distribution and impact of oestrogens and xeno-oestrogens in the aquatic environment and highlights some significant knowledge gaps in our understanding of endocrine disrupting chemicals. Key areas of uncertainty in the assessment of risk include the role of estuarine sediments in mediating the fate and bioavailability of environmental (xeno)oestrogens (notably their transfer to benthic organisms and estuarine food chains), together with evidence for endocrine disruption in invertebrate populations.

              
Emphasis is placed on using published information to interpret the behaviour and effects of a small number of 'model compounds' thought to contribute to oestrogenic effects in nature; namely, the natural steroid 17β-oestradiol (E2) and the synthetic hormone 17α-ethinyloestradiol (EE2), together with the alkylphenols octyl- and nonyl-phenol (OP, NP) as oestrogen mimics. Individual sections of the review are devoted to sources and concentrations of (xeno)oestrogens in waterways, sediment partitioning and persistence, bioaccumulation rates and routes, assays and biomarkers of oestrogenicity, and, finally, a synopsis of reproductive and ecological effects in aquatic species.

T1  - Temperature-Dependent Rates Of Larval Development In Limnoperna Fortunei (Bivalvia: Mytilidae)
AN  - 195533142
AB  - Laboratory-reared larvae of Limnoperna fortunei (Dunker) were monitored until the morula stage at 26°C, and from there on until settlement at 20, 25 and 28°C. The first polar lobe is produced c. 40 min after spawning, and the first division occurs 14 min later. Slightly over an hour after spawning, the second polar lobe appears and the second division yields a 4-cell stage. The third division occurs 90 min after spawning, and the fourth 115 min after spawning. The morula stage is reached 3.5 h after spawning. The trochophore stage (size: 95-110 ¼m) is reached 20, 6.3 and 6 h after spawning at 20, 25 and 28°C, respectively. Straight-hinged veligers (115-175 ¼m) start appearing at 45, 26, and 24 h after spawning; umboned veligers (156-220 ¼m) at 287, 165 and 118 h after spawning; and pediveligers (>200 ¼m) at 480, 313 and 265 h after spawning. Implications of these findings for the dispersion of the species and for its fouling impact are discussed.

AB  - A number of scientific journals published findings of numerous research studies and investigations in the year 2004 on the subject of lake and reservoir management. Two journals were exclusively attributed to lake and reservoir management, namely, Lake and Reservoir Management published by the North American Lake Management Society (NALMS) and Lakes and Reservoirs; Research and Management, an official journal of the International Lake Environment Committee (ILEC). In this review, an attempt was made to cover, as much as possible, all topics directly related to the management of lakes and reservoirs. In addition, efforts were made to cover a diversity of studies on the lake and reservoir ecology, as related to nutrients, limnology, eutrophication, etc., however, papers of pure scientific nature on microbial isolation, enumeration, characterization, and population dynamics were not included.

T1  - NUTRIENT RESERVES OF LESSER SCAUP (AYTHYA AFFINIS) DURING SPRING MIGRATION IN THE MISSISSIPPI FLYWAY: A TEST OF THE SPRING CONDITION HYPOTHESIS
AN  - 196448774
AB  - The continental scaup population (Lesser [Aythya affinis] and Greater [A. marila] combined) has declined markedly since 1978. One hypothesis for the population decline states that reproductive success has decreased because female scaup are arriving on breeding areas in poorer body condition than they did historically (i.e. spring condition hypothesis). We tested one aspect of that hypothesis by comparing body mass and nutrient reserves (lipid, protein, and mineral) of Lesser Scaup at four locations (Louisiana, Illinois, Minnesota, and Manitoba) between the 1980s and 2000s. We found that mean body mass and lipid and mineral reserves of females were 80.0, 52.5, and 3.0 g higher, respectively, in the 2000s than in the 1980s in Louisiana; similarly, body mass and lipid and mineral reserves of males were 108.8, 72.5, and 2.5 g higher, respectively. In Illinois, mean body mass and lipid reserves of females were 88.6 and 56.5 g higher, respectively, in the 2000s than in the 1980s; similarly, body mass and lipid and mineral reserves of males were 80.6, 76.0, and 2.7 g higher, respectively. Mean body mass of females were 58.5 and 58.9 g lower in the 2000s than in the 1980s in Minnesota and Manitoba, respectively; mean body mass of males, similarly, were 40.7 g lower in Minnesota. Mean lipid reserves of females in the 2000s were 28.8 and 27.8 g lower than those in the 1980s in Minnesota and Manitoba, respectively. Mean mineral reserves of females in the 2000s were 3.2 g lower than those in the 1980s in Manitoba. Consequently, females arriving to breed in Manitoba in the 2000s had accumulated lipid reserves for 4.1 fewer eggs and mineral reserves for 0.8 fewer eggs than those arriving to breed there in the 1980s. Accordingly, our results are consistent with the spring condition hypothesis and suggest that female body condition has declined, as reflected by decreases in body mass, lipids, and mineral reserves that could cause reductions in reproductive success and ultimately a population decline.

T1  - Ballast water answer?
AN  - 213510900
AB  - The Venturi Oxygen Stripping System, developed by NEI Treatment Systems of Los Angeles, is said to eliminate the introduction of invasive organisms while simultaneously protecting the vessel's ballast tanks against corrosion. By mixing very low-oxygen inert gas into ballast water as it is processed in the system, the unit removes 95% of the dissolved oxygen from the water in seconds, with no flow rate limit, leaving it to arrive in the ballast tanks in a deoxygenated state.

T1  - To what extent does upright sessile epifauna affect benthic biodiversity and community composition?
AN  - 208075396
AB  - Small-scale habitat complexity, including that caused by biological structures, is an important factor in structuring benthic communities and also sometimes in increasing biodiversity. The aim of this study was to determine if hydroid colonies have an effect on the composition of benthic communities in the Irish Sea, and if so, which components of the fauna are affected. Forty-six seabed core samples were taken by divers from two sites off Port Erin, Isle of Man, Irish Sea. Half of these were centred on hydroid colonies, half were not. All taxa retained by a 63-microm sieve from the cores were identified and counted. Community composition and diversity were compared between hydroid and non-hydroid cores using multivariate and univariate methods. Benthic communities were significantly different between the two sample groups. This was almost entirely due to the presence of sessile and mobile epifaunal taxa in the hydroid cores. The tube-building amphipod, Ericthonius punctatus, was particularly abundant attached to the hydroid stems. Infauna was not significantly different between the two groups. Upright sessile epifauna may play a particularly important role in the Irish Sea as a settlement substrate for juvenile scallops (Pecten maximus and Aequipecten opercularis), which are an important fishery resource in this area. The 11-year closure of an area to dredging has not only enhanced scallop stocks but has had the added benefit of enhancing habitat complexity and biodiversity. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - BIOCHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF THREE SPECIES OF UNIONID MUSSELS AFTER EMERSION
AN  - 195528738
AB  - Freshwater mussels are emersed (exposed to air) during conservation activities such as surveys and relocations. Success of these activities depends upon the ability of mussels to survive emersion and to re-burrow in the substratum. We evaluated the acute sublethal effects of emersion on three species of unionid mussels [pocketbook, Lampsilis cardium (Rafinesque, 1820); pimpleback, Quadrula pustulosa pustulosa (I. Lea, 1831); spike, Elliptio dilatata (Rafinesque, 1820)] by measuring three biochemicals (carbohydrate, lipid, protein) indicative of biochemical function and energy storage. Mussels were acclimated in water at 25[degrees]C and exposed to five air temperatures (15, 20, 25, 35 and 45[degrees]C) for 15, 30 and 60 min. After emersion, mussels were returned to water at 25[degrees]C and observed for 14 days. Samples of mantle tissue were taken after the 14-day postexposure period and analysed for carbohydrate, lipid and protein. Three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) did not reveal consistent trends in carbohydrate, lipid or protein concentrations due to sex of mussels, duration of emersion, air temperature or their interaction terms that indicated biological compensation to stress. Overall mean carbohydrate concentrations were greatest (range 447-615 mg/g dry wt) among the species, followed by protein (179-289 mg/g dry wt) and lipids (26.7-38.1 mg/g dry wt). These results have positive implications for conducting conservation activities, because emersion over the range of temperatures (15-35[degrees]C) and durations (15-60 min) examined did not appear acutely harmful to mussels.

T1  - Diet and body condition of spectacled eiders wintering in pack ice of the Bering Sea
AN  - 733705210
AB  - Spectacled eiders (Somateria fischeri) winter among leads in the Bering Sea pack ice, where they dive 40-70 m for benthic prey. During the first icebreaker cruises into that area, esophagi of collected eiders contained only clams, mostly Nuculana radiata, with no trace of the once-dominant Macoma calcarea. Alternative prey used elsewhere (snails, amphipods, other bivalves) were available but not eaten. Eiders ate mainly N. radiata 18-24 mm long, although M. calcarea of this length contained 62% more energy. Percent body lipid of eiders averaged 12±3% (SD) for 26 adult males and 14±3% for 12 adult females. Mean body mass (±SE) of these males in late March (1,688±21 g) was higher than reported for 53 males after arriving at breeding areas in late May (1,494±14 g). Body mass of these females (1,550±35 g) was lower (but not significantly) than reported for 11 females upon arrival at breeding sites (1,623±46 g). In 1999, the last spectacled eiders left the wintering area on 21 April, 4-8 weeks before their typical arrival at breeding sites. Their location is unknown in the interim, when habitats used appear critical to acquiring reserves for reproduction.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - The PWSA lab has also utilized the BAX system for screening water samples for Salmonella. The need for this screening capability arose during the summer of 2002 when several dead ducks were recovered during a one-month period from an open finished water reservoir in the PWSA distribution system. Necropsy and bacteriological analysis of a carcass at the Cornell University School of Veterinary Medicine indicated that this particular animal had died from a Salmonella infection.

T1  - Escape responses of copepod nauplii in the flow field of the blue mussel, Mytillus edulis
AN  - 208067968
AB  - Bivalves are important grazers on phytoplankton in shallow waters. However, very little is known about their ability to capture actively moving zooplankton. We investigated the escape response and success of early and late nauplii of three copepod species (Acartia tonsa, Temora longicornis and Eurytemora affinis) in the flow field of a blue mussel, Mytilus edulis, using both video observations and incubation experiments. An empirical model was created to describe the spatial distribution of the fluid deformation rate. Nauplii responded with escape jumps at mean fluid deformation rates of 0.6-1.9 sm1. Escape success differed between taxa. T. longicornis was the poorest escaper, while A. tonsa and E. affinis were more efficient and similar to one another. Deformation rates differed in different parts of the flow field, which resulted in differences in escape success between the sectors. Nauplii were caught most often in the sector furthest away from the exhalent siphon, where the deformation rate was the weakest. There the nauplii were unable to detect an escape signal in time to react and flee. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Considerations in the design of the primary treatment for ballast systems
AN  - 211767938
AB  - Investigations are currently underway to establish effective primary and secondary ballast water treatment methods to minimize the potential for the introduction of additional nonindigenous aquatic species into the Great Lakes and other U.S. coastal waters. This treatment could be used in place of mid-ocean ballast exchange currently required by the U.S. Coast Guard for all vessels entering the Great Lakes in ballast from beyond the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).

T1  - Comaprison of the bioavailability of Cr and Fe bound with natural colloids of different origins and sizes to two marine bivales
AN  - 208076937
AB  - Recent studies have demonstrated the significant role of colloidal microparticles or macromolecules in the biogeochemical cycling of trace metals in aquatic environments. In this study, the influences of different colloidal organic carbon (COC) concentrations, colloidal sizes and colloidal origins (estuarine vs coastal) on the bioavailability of two trace metals (Cr and Fe) to the green mussel Perna viridis and the clam Ruditapes philippinarum were examined under laboratory conditions. Natural colloids were isolated by cross-flow ultrafiltration and were radiolabeled with 59Fe and 51Cr before being exposed to the mussels and clams. The uptake of colloid-bound Cr and Fe was compared with the uptake of low molecular weight complexed metals (<1 kDa). Both natural colloid-bound Cr and Fe were bioavailable to the green mussels and clams. The uptake of both colloidal Cr and Fe by the two bivalves was much higher than that of their counterparts in a low molecular weight fraction, implying that colloidal binding enhanced considerably the bioavailability of Cr and Fe to the bivalves. The magnitude to which Cr uptake was enhanced, due to its binding with colloids, was much greater than that of Fe. There was no significant difference in the measured dry weight concentration factor of the metals between the two COC concentrations. Similarly, the COC concentration did not influence metal uptake when all the experiments were considered together. There was generally no major difference in the metal bioavailability between the two different sizes of colloids isolated from the coastal waters (1-10 kDa and 10 kDa-0.2 microm), whereas metals bound with the larger size colloids isolated from the estuarine waters were more bioavailable than metals bound with the smaller size colloids. The bioavailability of Cr and Fe bound with the colloids from estuarine waters was generally lower than those bound with colloids from the coastal waters. This study demonstrated that the geochemical properties of colloids (origin) and the chemical properties of metals are critical in affecting the bioavailability of colloid-bound metals to marine bivalves.

T1  - Do tributary streams contribute significantly to the transport of faecal pellets in large rivers?
AN  - 917591060
AB  - Faecal pellets (FPs) produced by suspension feeders, notably larval blackflies (Diptera: Simuliidae), contribute significantly to the conversion and transport of organic matter in northern rivers. In this study we investigated the relative contribution of tributaries to the flux of FPs in a 7^sup th^ order river in northern Sweden. The influx of FPs to the larger river was positively dependent on tributary sub-catchment area, stream order, channel width, proportion of lakes in the sub-catchment, and current velocity. The contribution was <45% of the flux in the large river, but generally it was well below 10% suggesting that the large river transport of FPs is produced within the main channel and not imported from the tributaries, although the latter may significantly support the suspension feeders with food material.

T1  - The effect of sea urchins as biogenic structures on the local abundance of a temperate reef fish
AN  - 2609868395
AB  - Although widely distributed on rocky reefs at Santa Catalina Island (southern California, USA), the small, substrate-oriented fish, Lythrypnus dalli, often reaches its highest densities in areas of extreme vertical relief where the sea urchin, Centrostephanus coronatus, is common. Through surveys and manipulative field experiments, we examined the extent to which the availability of C. coronatus influenced the distribution and abundance of L. dalli. Adult L. dalli were strongly associated with C. coronatus, but not with two shorter-spined urchins, Strongylocentrotus franciscanus and S. purpuratus. Variation in fish abundance among C. coronatus was affected by three features: the amount of space between the body of the urchin and its rocky shelter, the location of occupied shelters, and urchin size. Field manipulations of C. coronatus density indicated that spatial patterns of L. dalli abundance are causally linked to the presence of urchins. Urchins also had a significant effect on recruitment, migration, and survival of L. dalli. These processes were greatly enhanced where urchins were present. Structural substitutions (models) produced about half the effect of live urchins indicating that biological, as well as structural, attributes of urchins may be important to fish. Our results suggest that habitat selection at the time of settlement, small-scale migration of fish after settlement, and differential survival relative to the presence of sea urchins contribute to the formation and maintenance of the association between L. dalli and C. coronatus. By altering the availability of refuges, sea urchins appear to have a direct and positive effect on the local abundance of this temperate reef fish.

T1  - Impacts of fish predation on an Ohio River zooplankton community
AN  - 220280420
AB  - Compared to lentic systems, much less is known about the factors that structure zooplankton communities in large river environments. In this study, we used an in situ mesocosm system, the potamocorrals, to assess the impact of larval fish on the zooplankton community in the Ohio River (USA). The responses of zooplankton to increasing biomasses of fish were taxon-dependent. The population growth rates of the most common zooplankton, Diacyclops thomasi, varied inversely with fish biomass, while other crustacean zooplankton showed no significant responses to the fish treatment. The reverse pattern was seen for the rotifer Polyarthra sp. whose population growth rates increased with increasing fish biomass. This is the first in situ evaluation of fish predation on zooplankton in a large river system and demonstrates that predation as well as physical factors may influence riverine zooplankton densities and community structure.

T1  - Crafting a Lake Protection Ordinance
AN  - 196838443
AB  - Cappiella and Scheler describe how to craft an ordinance to protect and maintain the quality of lakes from the pressures of both shoreline and watershed development. A lake protection ordinance (LPO) is particularly critical around urban lakes, to guide how and where new development will occur. Historically, there has been limited guidance on how to craft an effective LPO that protects lake resources, maintains the quality of the recreational experience, and accommodates the property rights of landowners. Traditionally, most LPOs have primarily focused on a relatively narrow ring of land around the shoreline where development is most visible. However, given that lakes are so strongly influenced by runoff from their watersheds, they often need to be managed from a watershed perspective.

T1  - Why Short-Term Bioassays Are Not Meaningful--Effects of a Pesticide (Imidacloprid) and a Metal (Cadmium) on Pea Aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum Harris)
AN  - 214671425; 11383475
AB  - The life-table study on effects of a heavy metal, Cd (100 and 200 mg kg-1 soil), and an insecticide, imidacloprid (4 and 40 g a.i. ha-1), on pea aphids revealed significant effects of both chemicals on life history traits and population dynamics. Substantial differences in the action of the two chemicals and between the two doses of imidacloprid were observed. The pesticide caused high mortality at the beginning of the experiment, however some aphids were able to live for as long as control insects. In contrast, Cd-induced mortality was low at the beginning but increased during the experiment. Analysis of data collected during the first 10 days of the experiment, the first 20 days, or for the whole life-time of the cohort gave different results. While highly significant effects of imidacloprid were detected already after 10 days of the experiment, Cd treatment resulted in no effect for this time of exposure. Higher dose of imidacloprid decreased growth and development rates along with delayed reproduction (9th or 10th day). In contrast, the aphids treated with the low dose of imidacloprid and with both concentrations of Cd started their reproduction at the same day as untreated insects (6th or 7th day), but the reproduction tended to cease earlier. This indicates that too short ecotoxicological tests may result in serious underestimation of some effects, while overestimating others.

T1  - Competition Between Native and Exotic Daphnia: In situ Experiments
AN  - 220272143
AB  - The recently introduced exotic cladoceran Daphnia lumholtzi offers an excellent opportunity to study the interactions between exotic and native species in invaded communities. Lake surveys in Missouri have indicated a seasonal succession between native Daphnia and D. lumholtzi. In the current study, we examined competition between D. lumholtzi and the native Daphnia parvula by conducting seasonal in situ field experiments in 1.6 l enclosures. Competition was assessed by comparing the rates of increase (r) and birth rates (b) of each species when grown alone versus when grown together in these enclosures. At high densities, D. lumholtzi suppressed D. parvula rates of increase during the late summer and fall experiments, but did not appear to suppress D. parvula birth rates. The rates of increase of D. lumholtzi did not appear to be affected by the presence of D. parvula. The results of these experiments indicate that although competition between the two species occurs seasonally at high densities, the effects are asymmetrical. The lack of competitive effects on D. lumholtzi byD. parvula suggests that factors other than competition are involved in explaining the absence ofD. lumholtzi in spring zooplankton assemblages.

T1  - THE EVOLUTION OF BROODING CHARACTERS AMONG THE FRESHWATER PEARLY MUSSELS (BIVALVIA: UNIONOIDEA) OF NORTH AMERICA
AN  - 195528753
AB  - Brooding characters have figured prominently in the classification of North American freshwater pearly mussels (Bivalvia: Unionoidea). The purpose of our study was to evaluate phylogenetic hypotheses of brooding character evolution in order to test homology statements suggested by earlier taxonomic systems of the Unionoidea. Parsimony analysis of partial COI sequences from 29 species of freshwater mussels and 13 outgroups were used to derive a phylogeny. Thirteen brooding characters (e.g., brooding period, marsupium arrangement, structure of interlamellar septa, etc.) were traced onto this phylogeny. Results indicate that long-term brooding (bradytictia) is the derived state among North American freshwater mussels; short-term brooding (tachytictia) is plesiomorphic. Bradytictia evolved independently in the Anodontinae and Lampsilini, with unique morphological modifications derived in those clades to facilitate long-term brooding.

T1  - Development of an Argopecten-Specific 18S rRNA Targeted Genetic Probe
AN  - 1953830928
AB  - Comparison of 18S ribosomal RNA gene sequences between diverse bivalve species, including eight scallop species, allowed the design of an 18S rRNA targeted oligonucleotide probe (BS-1364) that was specific for scallops belonging to the genus Argopecten (bay and calico scallops). The high sequence similarity of the 18S rRNA gene between Argopecten irradians and Argopecten gibbus (98.8%) prevented the design of an A. irradians species-specific probe. Hybridization studies using amplified 18S rDNA from a diverse collection of bivalve species demonstrated that the specificity of the digoxygenin-labeled probe was consistent with the predicted specificity indicated by sequence comparison. Hybridization studies using laboratory-spawned bay scallop veligers indicated that a single veliger could be detected by probe hybridization in a blot format, and that probe hybridization signal was proportional (r^sup 2^= .99) to the abundance of veligers. Methods for rRNA extraction and blotting were developed that allowed bay scallop veligers to be specifically and quantitatively identified in natural plankton samples. Preliminary studies conducted in Tampa Bay, Florida, suggest that introduced scallops can successfully spawn and produce veligers under in situ conditions. The Argopecten-specific probe and methods developed in this study provide the means to study the production and fate of bay scallop larvae in nature and provide evidence that scallops introduced into Tampa Bay have the potential for successful reproduction and enhancement of scallop stocks.

T1  - Glochidia of the freshwater mussel Lampsilis overwintering on fish hosts
AN  - 195526409
AB  - Largemouth Bass were infected with glochidia of the freshwater mussel Lampsilis cardium. Three fishes each were held at 4.5, 10, and 15.5[degrees]C; five fish were held at 21[degrees]C. By 64 days, metamorphosed juveniles were found in the 15.5 and 21[degrees]C trials but not in the 5.5 and 10[degrees]C trials, indicating that the lower threshold temperature for metamorphosis was between 10 and 15.5[degrees]C for the duration. In a second experiment, Largemouth Bass were infected with glochidia of L. cardium and held at 10[degrees]C. A sample of fishes was removed monthly and brought to 21[degrees]C. Numbers of glochidia that metamorphosed after being warmed were compared to the number that metamorphosed without warming. The percentage that metamorphosed after warming decreased linearly with time. At one month, 100% of the glochidia metamorphosed after warming. This decreased to 80% by two months, to 30% by four months and 3% by six months. Although this post-warming percentage decreased with time, the total percentage of metamorphosed juveniles (at all temperatures) was not correlated with time. Controls kept at 21[degrees]C required three weeks to reach peak metamorphosis, but test subjects subjected to 10[degrees]C required less than nine days to metamorphose once warmed. Many overwintering glochidia therefore complete a portion of their development on the host at winter temperatures, but stop short of excystment. Some glochidia metamorphosed without being warmed, but this phenomenon is not understood. This study confirms that glochidia may overwinter on hosts, with some glochidia persisting for more than six months before metamorphosing when warmer conditions return.

T1  - Integrated Biological and Chemical Monitoring: In situ Physiological Responses of Freshwater Crayfish to Fluctuations in Environmental Ammonia Concentrations
AN  - 214685878
AB  - A portable, computer-aided physiological monitoring system (CAPMON) has been integrated with an automated, flow injection (FI) based chemical monitor to enable continuous, long-term recording of cardiac activity in selected aquatic organisms, and total ammonia concentration in the surrounding environment. Heart rate of the freshwater crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus was recorded using non-invasive infrared emitter/detectors to transduce heart beat from 4 animals simultaneously. Data were collected continuously and stored on a laptop computer. The chemical monitor incorporated a gas diffusion unit and a solid state photometric detector. Remote control and data processing were accomplished using an in-house designed microcomputer. The instrumentation was fully evaluated in the laboratory and the field and was shown to be capable of operating unattended for periods of at least 1 week. An exposure-response experiment showed that 4 h exposures to concentrations of ammonia greater than 5 mg l^-1 had a significant stimulatory effect on heart rate (ANOVA F=7.6; df=5; P<0.0005). The feasibility of using the system in situ was demonstrated in a 2 week field trial in which the integrated monitors were successfully deployed at a landfill leachate lagoon.

AB  - We studied size-selective predation by Common Eiders (Somateria mollissima) feeding on blue mussels (Mytilus edulis).  Selection varied with location, season, and prey availability, and for the most part ducks preferred smaller mussels than those that would have been most energetically profitable on a per prey basis.

T1  - Mussels as bioindicators of trace metal pollution in the Danube Delta of Romania
AN  - 821458127
AB  - Specimens of mussels species Anodonta anatina, Unio pictorum, U. tumidus and surfical sediment samples were collected in the summers of 1994 and 1995 from twelve lakes in the Danube Delta, Romania. Whole mussel tissues were analyzed for metals (Ag, As, Cd, Co, Cu, Cr, Ni, Pb, Se and Zn), and sediment samples were subjected to weak acid extraction and to a sequential extraction procedure, and analyzed for Cr, Cu, Ni and Zn. Total mean Cu and Ag concentrations were statistically greater in Unio species than in Anodonta species, but other metal levels did not significantly differ between mussel species. There was a ten fold variation for Cd and Pb and five fold variation for Zn, Ag and Co concentrations in mussels among lakes. Mean concentrations of As, Cu, Se and Zn in mussel tissues varied two fold among lakes. Zn, Co and Cd concentrations in mussels were significantly negatively correlated with distance gradients from the origin of the Delta and with distance from main channels of the Danube. Other metal concentrations in mussels did not correlate with either distance gradient. Trace metal levels in mussel tissues were correlated with those in weak acid and in sequential extractions of sediment. Zn concentrations in the carbonate fraction was the best predictor of Zn concentrations in mussels. Cu and Ni levels in the organic matter and sulfide fraction were the best estimators of Cu and Ni concentrations in mussels.

T1  - Grazing by large river zooplankton: a key to summer potamoplankton decline? The case of the Meuse and Moselle rivers in 1994 and 1995
AN  - 2663836125
AB  - To explain summer declines in phytoplankton biomass in large rivers, we compared the effect of zooplankton grazing on the planktonic algae of two large European rivers, the Meuse and the Moselle. In situ grazing was measured during two years (1994 and 1995), using the Haney method. Total zooplankton community filtration rates recorded in the river Meuse ranged between 1 and 32% of the water volume filtered per day. A drastic algal decline was observed early July both years and may be explained by high densities of a rotifer-dominated zooplankton community (500–700 ind. l-1) with more than 75% of Brachionus calyciflorus. During the summer period in 1994, when grazing was over 20%, edible algal biomass was controlled by a diversified rotifer community (up to 2500 ind. l-1), while a non-edible algal assemblage developed. In contrast, phytoplankton biomass remained comparatively low in the Moselle throughout the low-flow period, as did zooplankton numbers during most of this time (fewer than 200 ind. l-1 during the summer period). The proportion of crustaceans in this zooplankton was rather higher than in the Meuse, and they dominated at times, in biomass as well as in numbers. Nevertheless, measured in situ grazing rates (1–15%) could not explain the low summer algal biomass, even if low filtration rates may at times represent a significant carbon loss for phytoplankton, when and where net algal production was low. As a conclusion, the role of phytoplankton – zooplankton interactions in controlling algal biomass in large rivers is discussed.

T1  - REVIEW OF PROGRESS UNDER THE STRATEGIC VISION
AN  - 1935880022
AB  - In 1991 the Commission adopted a strategic vision encompassing three areas: healthy ecosystems, integrated management of sea lamprey, and improved institutional/stakeholder partnerships. A review of progress slated for 1995 shows that, although much has been accomplished, achievement of some milestones is behind schedule and achievement of others is difficult to assess because they are either too far reaching or too qualitative. Achievement of the milestones in the vision statement on healthy ecosystems will require a concerted effort by all natural resource agencies with responsibilities for the Great Lakes. An objective of this review is the establishment of a procedural framework for linking water quality and fisheries management on the lakes. Considerable progress has been made in achieving the objectives of the partnership vision statement milestones but accomplishments typically fell short of the target dates. Fish community objectives have been developed for four of the five lakes and research priorities have been identified.

T1  - Development, Testing and Implementation of Automated Biotests for the Monitoring of the River Rhine, Demonstrated by Bacteria and Algae Tests
AN  - 1943308578
AB  - A joint research project for the development, testing and implementation of automated biotests, capable of rapidly detecting acutely toxic water conditions of the River Rhine, was carried out by several administrative and scientific institutions in Germany. Automated biomonitors working with the test organisms bacteria, algae, water fleas, mussels, and fishes were tested and compared with respect to their sensitivity, reliability, and practical handling under field conditions. Field trials with atrazine and sodium pentachlorophenolate as toxicants were performed on the River Rhine. Threshold values and LOEC-values (Lowest observed effect concentration) were determined to compare the test specific sensitivity of the test systems. From 1990 to 1992 various biomonitors were tested in monitoring stations on the river Rhine and in a mobile laboratory container on the rivers Rhine and Main. Results of bacteria and algae tests are presented.

T1  - Monitoring and Estimating Concentrations and Effects of Microcontaminants in the Rhine-Delta: Chemical Analysis, Biological Laboratory Assays and Field Observations
AN  - 1943295685
AB  - The aim of the Rhine Action Program is to create conditions for the return of (higher) indigenous species. To obtain an impression of current levels of contamination, several separate studies were carried out. The methods applied are discussed briefly and several representative results are given. The focus will be on the integration of the conclusions with respect to the goals of the Program. 
First, concentrations of traditional microcontaminants in sediment, water and organisms, collected in monitoring programs, are presented. Concentrations of some compounds, such as cadmium, have decreased substantially while concentrations of other compounds, like PCB153, remain on the same level as they were in the late seventies. The current levels will be compared to Dutch quality standards that are thought to protect most of the aquatic community. 
Secondly, responses in biological assays with Rhine water are presented. In the seventies, laboratory species died immediately after exposure to Rhine water. Nowadays, water has to be concentrated to induce acute mortality. Remarkably, only a few percent of the mortality observed after XAD-concentration can be explained by the organic microcontaminants identified by GC/MS. To cover calamities that are missed by these static assays and by daily chemical analysis, biological early warning systems are positioned along the river. In the past, monitors with the fish species ide (Leuciscus idus) have registered several calamities that were not detected by chemical early warning. Currently monitors with waterfleas (Daphnia magna) are being tested, in order to broaden the spectrum of concentrations and compounds covered. 
Thirdly, measured data are combined with literature information to obtain an impression of hazards for combinations of chemical compounds and biological taxa. Differences in exposure can be derived from knowledge on habitat and food composition, while information on sensitivity for a chemical can be estimated from data on related taxa. The assessment indicates that most taxa, included target taxa such as Salmonidae, are threatened by current concentrations of different groups of microcontaminants. 
Finally, some illustrative (semi-)field observations from the Rhine-delta area will be mentioned as a qualitative validation of the extrapolation from experimental and theoretical analysis.
